When you agree to play chess with Death, roll+INT.<br />On a 10+ you win and your next Last Breath move will be successful. Or a comrade will be returned from his kingdom?<br />On a 7-9 you play to a draw; gain a +1 on your next Last Breath roll.<br />On a 6 or less you lose and Death has a small quest in mind to square the books...or your soul would also be valid payment. The &quot;choice&quot; is yours.
