Yesterday&#39;s doodle in the ongoing saga of MOAR LUNCH TIME DOODLES!!!<br /><br />Yesterday, I was playing around with a new paper designed for inking, this stuff: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/" class="ot-anchor">https://www.amazon.com/</a>‚Ä¶/B00‚Ä¶/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00‚Ä¶<br /><br />I&#39;ve inked on in the past, but I wanted to play with ad markers too. It works very nice for ad markers. I love it for inking, especially nibs/quills. It is a very slick surface and not my favorite for pencil, however. I was getting some nice traction of laying in the tones with marker and then doing pencil on top of it.<br /><br />I JUST noticed the horrible perspective problem. Can you spot it?<br /><br />But that is why it is a doodle! Editing to happen posthaste in postproduction digitally!

        <p>Yah.  That is a doodle, it isn&#39;t finished and it is far from perfect (the spear haft should be in front of the snake&#39;s head, for example, I noticed that after I posted it, but easy fix in the digital).  But I have been drawing for 30 years, 20+ professionally.... so I make decisions quickly.   Sketches don&#39;t take me long.  Color?  Painting?  That is another matter as I agonize over every stroke.</p>
