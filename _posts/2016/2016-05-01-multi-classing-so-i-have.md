<b>Multi Classing</b><br /><br />So I have a question about multi classing. I understand that some moves allow for a cross class move, but I&#39;d hardly say this is multi-classing.<br /><br />Has anyone found a way to effectively multi class? I haven&#39;t tried it yet, but one way to do it would be to mimic AD&amp;D and level up each class separately.<br /><br />Example:<br />Trevor is a level 2 Fighter and a level 3 Wizard. This gives him a total level of 5.<br />Leveling would be the same, that is, you can&#39;t have a character who&#39;s combined levels exceeds 10. And the required XP for leveling any class would be your COMBINED LEVEL + 1.<br /><br />Suggestions? Experience?﻿<br /><br />P.S.<br />I also understand the intrusion of class niches if multi classing.

        <p>I mean then by level two if i was a level 1 fighter then choose to be a level 1 wizard i&#39;d gain 4 more starting moves and 3 spells. So I think that your idea of multiclassing is still horribly overpowering; where as the guy who simply doesnt multiclass because not everyone wants to; all he gets is an advanced move. </p>

        <p>That&#39;s my worry too. Has anyone been successful at multi classing aside from the cross class moves?<br /><br />This is something my group loves to do in other systems.</p>

        <p>The really important things about multiclassing come out in the fiction no matter how the mechanics work.</p>

        <p>I tried a Gestalt game of Dungeon World once, when I was still transitioning out of DnD 3.x. Each character had two playbooks, with all the starting moves from both and options to take advanced moves from either. I can&#39;t say how it would&#39;ve worked out, as it dissolved due to Play-by-Post decay, but I doubt I&#39;d do it again. Too much conceptual space to manage, for not a lot of benefit. Class Warfare accomplishes pretty much the same thing with less extraneous stuff.</p>

        <p>Yeah, combinations would definitely need a GM approval stamp–but to be fair, I require that anyway with playbooks I haven&#39;t seen before. Much as I love the &quot;it&#39;s impossible to be overpowered in Dungeon World&quot; philosophy, there are some playbooks that just have a chokehold on the spotlight. Lookin&#39; at you, Clock Mage. :P</p>

        <p>Also looking at Golem and Rainlord and especially <i>Collector</i>... Also Necromancer, but for different reasons...</p>

        <p>There are many issues with that.. For example which damage dice would you use? Which base  hp? If you could just make a bard as tanky and strong as a fighter this would be really broken. I suggest you try the multiclass moves, they work surprisingly well</p>

        <p>Thank you everyone. These are all concerns I had as well. I suppose I&#39;ll have to stick with CC and Class Warfare (although I find CW a bit clunky).</p>

        <p>I think you could do it, but it is only necessary if they plan on basically splitting their moves between the two classes. At level 1 have the player pick a class normally. At level 2 have them take 1 starting move from another class, readjust their HP, Load, Damage Die to whichever is lower between the two classes (or whatever everyone agrees is fair). At level 3 they can chose a 2-5 move from their first class, another starting move from their second class, or a 2-5 move from their second class. You could still do leveling the way you outlined, but I&#39;m not sure if it matters except for spell casting, or a move like the Cleric&#39;s Devoted Healer where you add your level.</p>

        <p>One of the ways you can use Class Warfare is to just treat it as a big list of compendium classes. You don&#39;t have to replace the base class system.</p>

That way a player can take a move from a class that the party needs to fill in a specific role without being too overpowered.</p>
