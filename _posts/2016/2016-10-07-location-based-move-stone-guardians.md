Location Based Move<br /><br />Stone Guardians<br />When you pass through an area of the evil overlord&#39;s keep, roll+3, minus the number of treasures you have looted from the keep so far (gold coins or other individual items count as one treasure). On a 10+ choose 2. On a 7-9 choose 1:<br />• The guardians turn to flesh, making them easier to harm.<br />• The guardians are slow, stupid or easy to predict.<br />• The guardians have no special abilities.

        <p>Ive been toying around with this method:<br /><br /><b>Stone Guardians</b><br /><i>Constructed by the evil Overlord, they serve their master each in their own constructed way.</i><br /><b>When you pass through an area of the evil overlord&#39;s keep</b>, roll+3, minus the number of treasures you have looted from the keep so far (gold coins or other individual items count as one treasure).<br />10+ choose 2 Faults.<br />7-9 choose 1 Fault and 1 Enhancement.<br /><br /><b>Fault</b><br />• The guardians are made of rotting flesh, making them easier to harm.<br />• The guardians are slow<br />• They are stupid or easy to predict.<br /><br /><b>Enhancement</b><br />• The guardians have wings<br />• They are comprised of smaller golems<br />• Elemental energy courses through their bodies. Choose one.<br /><br />This list can be adapted for the specific types of golems the Overlord may construct.</p>

        <p>First Statue: &quot;Don&#39;t go on!&quot;<br /><br />Second Statue: &quot;Go back, while you still can!&quot;<br /><br />Third Statue: &quot;This is not the way!&quot;<br /><br />Fourth Statue: &quot;Take heed, and go no further!&quot;<br /><br />Fifth Statue: &quot;Beware, beware!&quot;<br /><br />Sixth Statue: &quot;Soon it will be too late!&quot;<br /><br />Hoggle: &quot;Ah, don&#39;t pay any attention to them, they&#39;re just false alarms. You get a lot of them in the Labyrinth, especially when you&#39;re on the right track.&quot;<br /><br />Seventh Statue: &quot;Oh, no you&#39;re not!&quot;</p>
