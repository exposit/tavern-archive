My players are being pursued by an enemy that&#39;s something of a mix of John Carpenter&#39;s Thing, Stephen King&#39;s It, and an H.P. Lovecraft elder god. Here&#39;s the dungeon front I tried out on them last night which ends with a custom location-based move. The idea is a kind of twisted flashback episode where the player&#39;s answer questions about their PC&#39;s past and their answers are used to fuel dark visions.<br /><br />This is really my first time using a formal Front, as I usually just jam off what&#39;s in my head with what the players do, would appreciate feedback.<br /><br /><b>Campfire Tales (Outdoor Dungeon Front)</b><br />The Darkness invades the minds of the party while they are making camp and tries to sow fear and dissent in the group.<br />Cast: The Darkness in many varied guises<br />Stakes: What will we learn about each PC&#39;s past and motivations? Will any of them succumb to the Darkness&#39; influence?<br /><br /><b>Danger:</b> &quot;A Touch of Evil&quot; (Chosen One / Force of Chaos)<br />Impulse: To terrify and confuse with visions and quietly invade minds for later subjugation<br />Portents:<br />- The sky darkens and the fire flickers with an eerie blue light.<br />- A thick fog fills the night air, a thin mist coating the camp ground, as a feeling of oppressive evil falls upon the camp<br />- PCs on watch see ghastly shapes in the mist that disappear quickly. Eerie and unearthly shrieks and howls fill the night air.<br />- Sleeping PCs suffer terrible nightmares of terror, pain, and powerlessness that are difficult to wake from.<br /><br /><b>Impending Doom:</b><br /><b>When you finally see the rising sun after a fitful night of dark visions</b>, roll+WIS. On a 10+, you shake off the dread and steel yourself in the certainty that you can face any danger and overcome. On a 7-9, choose one:<br />- You are shaken by what you have experienced, choose a new fear for your character and describe how they express it.<br />- You see the others in a new light, describe the difference and how it will affect how you interact with them.<br />- Your sense of your own purpose has shifted, describe the change and how it will affect what you do from now on.<br /><br />In the end, all but one rolled 6- (the last rolled a 10+) but I decided to have them choose instead of making a hard move off my own.

        <p>Well done. I&#39;d like to hear how it shakes out for the party. A nice addition.</p>

        <p>I like your custom move, but I&#39;m not sure how the Grim Portents played out... I thought that portents normally only advance on a golden opportunity, but I don&#39;t see why the player would be failing lots of moves or otherwise giving you lots of golden opportunities during a single night of camping.</p>

They&#39;ve tangled with this thing before so they caught the whiff of something happening and failed a few rolls trying to figure it out, but I take your point. Could you suggest a way of creating a danger that happens in a camp sight overnight?</p>

        <p>I&#39;m no experienced DW GM; I&#39;ve only run a couple of sessions, so I&#39;m as in the dark as anyone :)<br /><br />There&#39;s probably nothing wrong with the way you ran it.  I&#39;m just trying to figure these things out for myself.<br /><br />Perhaps an interesting way to do something like this but more in keeping with how I understand Fronts to work would be to have each grim portent be an escalation of the nightmares, and rather than happening in a single night they build up over many nights?<br /><br />Like, originally someone (everyone?) in the party dreams of something weird but not too disturbing (they&#39;re flying over a Cyclopean city).  Then if they fail to deal with the thing sending the dreams and a Golden Opportunity comes up during the day and the next portent is ticked, the next night their dream recurs, but it goes further and is worse (they&#39;re flying over a Cyclopean city, and they approach a huge temple in the centre with dark liquid flowing down the staircase leading to the massive doors).<br /><br />Each portent that occurs causes the dream to go further and become darker, and the Impending Doom is that they eventually have the &quot;full&quot; sanity-threatening dream and experience something like your custom move.</p>
