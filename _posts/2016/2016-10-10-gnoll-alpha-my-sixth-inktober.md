I&#39;m going to draw monsters, weapons, and magic items from the <a rel="nofollow" class="ot-hashtag" href="https://plus.google.com/s/%23DungeonWorld/posts">#DungeonWorld</a> rulebook and from the Dungeon World Codex (<a href="http://codex.dungeon-world.com" class="ot-anchor">http://codex.dungeon-world.com</a>). <br /><br />If you like the drawings and would like to support me in Extra Life this year, you can donate to my campaign at <a href="http://www.extra-life.org/participant/jimjones" class="ot-anchor">http://www.extra-life.org/participant/jimjones</a>.<br /><br />You have my sincere appreciation if you do.<br /><br />All the money that I raise goes directly to Riley Hospital for Children in Indianapolis, Indiana. My youngest daughter, Rogue, had a life saving cranial reconstruction surgery at Riley when she was just a little over one year old. Today, she is a happy and healthy almost six year old who is thriving in kindergarten. <br /><br />Let me know what you think. <br /><br />ï»¿

My sixth #Inktober drawing is a #DungeonWorld gnoll alpha.

This is actually yesterday's drawing. I was only able to finish it today after prepping for our Extra Life event in two weeks. I'm behind. I'm hoping to catch up through this week.

Gnolls are one of my favorite monsters. Often an adventure ends when the dungeon or castle is looted. You better hope the owner of that dungeon didn't have a pack of gnolls on the payroll. Their</a>
