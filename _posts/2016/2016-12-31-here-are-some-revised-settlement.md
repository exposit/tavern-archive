Here are some revised settlement encounter tables to take around the block. The Perilous Wilds tables are meant to supplement this stuff in some places, and will be folded in to the final version of FotF2e.<br /><br />They don&#39;t feel as unified as I would like, but I&#39;ve been rolling test encounters and I&#39;m pretty happy with the scope and depth of results made possible by these 4 page spreads.<br /><br />Roll some yourself and interpret them here, if you feel inclined!

        <p>I will always support their publishing. It makes low to no prep games possible, and prepped games AMAZING.</p>
