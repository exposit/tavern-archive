Fun moment from last night&#39;s game, and an example of &quot;when a miss doesn&#39;t equal a failure&quot; and &quot;why you should always roll when someone casts a spell.&quot;<br /><br />The fighter and the wizard are in the jungle, high up in some cliffs, trying to get back to their barge as the sun sets. They just slaughtered some awakened (and hostile) baboons, and are worried about encountering more baboons.  But it&#39;s getting dark, and the wizard already lost a boot for Pete&#39;s sake, so he decides it&#39;s time to cast the <i>light</i> spell.  And he rolls a 4.<br /><br />The spell goes off, no problem. But it illuminates 5 pairs of eyes, perched in the trees, just behind the fighter.  They start to close in.<br /><br />&quot;What do you do?&quot;

        <p>Had a similar one a while back. During some down time, the cleric wanted to heal the creepy NPC lady who was guiding them through these ruins. No one liked her and everything felt off, but a cleric is a cleric.<br /><br />He rolls to heal the gash in her ribs and botches it. The holy light knits the flesh back and he slides her shirt back down, noticing there&#39;s not a single tear or blood stain on the cloth. She winks at him before standing to brush the dirt off.</p>
