The <i>10+ Treasure Vault</i> is a compilation of our <i>10+ Treasures</i> line, as well as various magic items from our numerous <i>Dungeon World</i> classes.<br /><br />It&#39;s ultimately intended to provide a more convenient print option, though it&#39;s also more convenient than rifling through five PDFs in search of a magic item: the only thing in here that you <i>won&#39;t</i> find in the other <i>10+ Treasures</i> books are random magic item tables and whatever items we lifted from classes.<br /><br />If you own one or more <i>10+ Treasures</i> volumes, go to the <i>10+ Treasure Trove</i> bundle (link herehttp://<a href="http://bit.ly/1L9pGEV" class="ot-anchor">bit.ly/1L9pGEV</a>): there should be previous purchaser discount notice, which will let you snag it (and the rest of the <i>10+ Treasure</i> volumes) without paying full price.<br /><br /> <a rel="nofollow" class="ot-hashtag" href="https://plus.google.com/s/%23dungeonworld/posts">#dungeonworld</a> Â
