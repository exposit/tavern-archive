Episode 30 of Discern Realities is here! The comic strip AP on this one is really interesting because <span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink" href="https://plus.google.com/116842813466282234979" oid="116842813466282234979">David LaFreniere</a></span> and I do a lot more collaborative world-building than we have done in the past. I think you&#39;re going to enjoy it. <br /><br />Also, David and I set a goal of thirty episodes by the end of 2016, and we&#39;re hitting that milestone a little early! We certainly couldn&#39;t have done it without our terrific community of listeners, so thanks to everyone who has supported the show. <br /><br />Enjoy!

        <p>Congrats on getting to episode 30 ahead of schedule!<br /><br />Re: rolling +Bond in the Goddess of Blood &amp; Cruel Fate custom move... since the move is about vengeance, maybe the Bond in question could be with the victim of your enemy, if they wronged someone close to you?<br /><br />Re: your competitions: is there somewhere on the net where the entries to the magic item and location-based custom moves competitions are collected together for people to browse/download?</p>
