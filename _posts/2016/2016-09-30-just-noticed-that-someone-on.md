Just Noticed that someone on reddit had already made a mad scientist class which is pretty similar to what I had in mind and on the other hand, Mark is making the krassis which is a mutant of sorts. I am thinking of moving on to my next class idea and leaving the scientist for another time when I get a better idea. What do you guys think?<br /><br />Link: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DungeonWorld/comments/49h90r/playbook_wips_the_magnate_the_mad_scientist/" class="ot-anchor">https://www.reddit.com/r/DungeonWorld/comments/49h90r/playbook_wips_the_magnate_the_mad_scientist/</a>
