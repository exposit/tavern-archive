I ran my first DW game last night and we had a blast. I used The Slave-Pit of Drazhu. I modified it a bit. Everyone started out with the Pit Slave playbook, but when they made it to 5XP I let them &quot;remember&quot; the hero they once were and select an appropriate playbook based on how they had played their slave -- lost HPs  and XP transferred over.<br /><br />I let them gain XP normally, but I also added 5 &quot;heroic flags.&quot;<br /><br />Heroic Flags<br />[  ]  Let me take damage for you when I am already hurt<br />[  ]  Allow me to give you a treasure that I could really use<br />[  ]  I Attack a Guard first<br />[  ]  I Attack Drazhu first<br />[  ]  Let me keep you from going first into danger so I can go myself<br /><br />I let each person use a flag once - they checked it off and gained the XP.<br /><br />It seemed to work well, everyone managed to &quot;remember&quot; their heroic selves before the big fight with the lich. (They lost their flags at this point.)<br /><br />One of the slaves died early on, but rolled an 8 at the Black Gate, so Hel offered the character a chance to live as a hero again, but they had to kill Drazhu or die trying -- no scampering away.<br /><br />Anyway fun was had by all!  I am converted to DW.<br /><br />Props to <span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink" href="https://plus.google.com/106188617380443434447" oid="106188617380443434447">Keith Martin</a></span> <span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink" href="https://plus.google.com/111042037776579192212" oid="111042037776579192212">Mark Zimmer</a></span>  for helping me with the game and <span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink" href="https://plus.google.com/108429258070600840800" oid="108429258070600840800">Jason Morningstar</a></span> for the fantastic module.

I beefed up the Lich (12 HPs and Armor 3) and added a horde of zombies to his lair. He nearly killed 2 of the PCs, but they also got in some awesome shots and took him out.</p>

        <p>As the player of the first slave in that game to &#39;discover&#39; that he was actually a hero, let me say that I had a fantastic time. I&#39;ve run DW a number of times, both one-shot games and short campaigns, but that was only my second turn on the other side of the screen. Wayne did a great job of both portraying a fantastic world and of being fans of the players.</p>
