This is just....weird.<br /><br />Here I am having my mind blown reading about L. Ron Hubbard, Jack Parsons, Crawley, JPL,Robert Heinlein, sex games,the occult, etc. (Strange Angel by George Pendle} and somebody has already turned the whole mess into a Cthulhu RPG adventure! (Cue Rod Serling...) I don&#39;t know how I&#39;m going to revamp this for Dungeon World but I may have to make it less bizarre...<br /><br />&quot;The Big Hoodoo is Lovecraftian noir in 1950s California with a ripped-from-history plot centered on the explosive death of real-world rocket scientist, science fiction fan, and occultist Jack Parsons in a garage laboratory in 1952. The investigators are iconic figures active in the science fiction scene at the time of Parsons&#39; death, and their inquiries lead them from the mean streets of Pasadena to the edge of the Mojave Desert and the mountains of southern California as well as the beaches of Los Angeles.<br /><br />Play sci-fi great Robert Heinlein, his ex-Navy engineer wife Virginia, renowned editor and mystery writer Tony Boucher, or a young Philip K. Dick as they confront the lunatic fringe in La-La Land, and find themselves caught in a charlatan&#39;s web of chicanery, mendacity, and deceit-laced with a strong strand of Mythos menace.<br /><br />The adventure includes brief biographical hooks for the PCs to orient players to their investigators as well as suggestions for alternate and additional investigators. Brief rules for a magic system intended to evoke the Enochian &quot;magick&quot; invented by John Dee and Edward Kelley, adopted by Aleister Crowley, and passed on to Jack Parsons are appended, and are used in the adventure. It can be played as a convention one-shot, or serve as the basis for a slightly longer set of episodes covering two or three evenings of entertainment.&quot;<br />                                                                                                      -DriveThruRPG

        <p>Why would you do that? Play it with Trail of Cthulhu.</p>

It does tempt me to try the Gumshoe system or maybe convert it to a CoC AW hack or even Monster hunters? Anybody on the Tavern play a Gumshoe system game? Advice on a good AW modern horror hack?</p>

        <p>Just play it with the Trail system, it&#39;s tailor made for these things. And you won&#39;t have to redo or rebalance all the mechanical stuff.</p>
