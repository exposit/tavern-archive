I&#39;m now tempted to try making my own paleolithic hack. Thanks to <span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink" href="https://plus.google.com/118088719859349999400" oid="118088719859349999400">Mark Tygart</a></span> for the Hyborian Age books, though I think Sagas of the Icelanders is going to be a closer touchstone. <br /><br />Right now I&#39;m thinking four stats, but I&#39;m having a tough time coming up with snappy names for them. Here&#39;s what I have so far:<br />​<br />- Physical fitness and overall health, comparable to Young in Saga of the Icelanders<br />- Instinct and animal-like cunning, the more predatory part of the psyche<br />- Social and higher brain functions, rational thought, the ability to innovate, craft, and defy tradition<br />- Influence of the spirit world, comparable to Weird.

        <p>They definitely need monosyllabic names.</p>

        <p>The Storytellers tell us that Fire was the first spirit to ally with the clans, in a time before there even were clans. Fire gave the people light to keep the darkness at bay, and warmth to drive out cold. For a fire to go out meant the death of early clans, but people have learned to harness Fire better over the ages.<br /><br />Fire’s gift was also one of invention. Those who grew to work with and understand Fire became more intelligent. They saw the way the world worked, but not in the manner of a shaman. Rather, they saw how clans may carve a new niche for themselves, and how they might improve on tradition. The clans are changing, this is undeniable. The ascent of Fire is challenging the reign of both the spirits and the Predator Kings. Humanity stands upon the cusp of a new world. And once again, only the fittest will survive.<br /><br /><br />Rival Clans<br />Fertile hunting grounds are a valuable resource, and hotly contested. Each clan has developed its own set of principles. Some may see others as potential allies to barter with. Others may see outsiders as threats to their own survival, or as a source of easy prey. While the more savage of clans know only aggression, others are learning that it can be advantageous to cooperate with each other for their mutual gain. Of course, if these agreements are broken, the potential reward may be too great to resist.<br /><br /><br />The Predator Kings<br />Humans are by far the most dangerous of creatures in the land. This is the era where large predators, such as big cats, wolves, and bears, still outstrip humans in terms of hunting ability, though this gap is slowly closing. When humans and other predators compete for the same prey, conflict is inevitable. A party of hunters may suddenly find themselves becoming the hunted. Human tools are gradually turning the tide against the predator kings, but to fight one of them or an entire pack is still a feat for only great warriors. To wear to beautiful skin of a Predator King or use their fangs as jewelry is a mark of great prowess and ability.<br /><br /><br />The Followers of the New Gods<br />Many clans have turned away from the spirits of the sky, and instead worship new gods that come from the earth. These gods inhabit idols made of stone, or more rarely, gold. The followers live in wooden houses and do not follow herds, but instead entreat their gods to make grains grow around their villages. If the gods choose not to cooperate, their worshippers starve.<br /><br />Like their gods, those who follow them can be fickle and cruel. Agrarian society brings with it the concept of material wealth, and all the mischief that comes with it. A clan trying to trade gold to a village may find themselves pressed into slavery.<br /><br /><br />The Spirit World<br />The world—as expressed in this game—is fundamentally animistic. Spirits animate not only all living things, including people, but also essential forces of nature. Mountains, rivers, and trees all possess some essential spirit. The interaction of these various spirits within this unseen world shapes the visible events of everything: the weather, the migration of herds, and illnesses. Spirits may become offended and refuse to help for a time. For example, the auroch-spirit may drive the herds away from hunters. Appeasement of these spirits may be an ordeal for the clan. <br /><br />A common trait among animistic spirits is that they are all fundamentally motivated by the idea of a world that flows in a cycle, the will of the Great Spirit in the Sky. To move with this cycle if to understand when the seasons turn, and what paths the herds will take. Defying the cycle invites disaster, as seen when some clans try to break tradition.<br /><br /><br />The Sky-People<br />It may be that the clans are not the first people to walk the earth. There may have been other types of clans that came before them, ones who had greater command of Fire beyond anyone’s wildest dreams. So great was their power that they could walk among the sky, within the Great Spirit’s domain. For this hubris, they were cast down and scattered, their powers nearly broken. But even a fragment of this power is still terrible to behold. It is fortunate for the clans that the Sky-People have dwindled away to almost nothing by now.<br /><br />Adding the Sky-People gives your game a post-apocalyptic flavor. Do relics of the Sky-People civilization persist, or have they been worn to nothingness over the eons? Are they still mortal? Could the clans make use of their tools?<br /><br /><br />The Deep Things<br />All clans know to stay away from the salt water. The things that reside deep within it are alien and terrible, some with fangs to rival even those of the Predator Kings. Likewise, in the deepest of caves life grows strange and pale. These places are the enemy of Fire, shrouded in darkness and cold. What would happen if the things from the deep places chose to attack the surface world? Would they bring plagues or madness? What if some people even sought to ally with them?</p>
