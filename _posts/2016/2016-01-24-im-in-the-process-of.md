I&#39;m in the process of revisiting my Stress rules to create a more grim or dark fantasy feel. One thing I had in mind to represent a growing mental imbalance was to forcibly change the character&#39;s alignment move. The new move should be something that causes mischief or inter-party conflict without being overly disruptive. Here&#39;s a few I had in mind to start with, please help me think of move!<br /><br />Tippler<br />Get drunk at an inconvenient time, or cause trouble from your drinking.<br /><br />Gambler<br />Take a serious risk to acquire something valuable.<br /><br />Compulsive<br />Investigate something interesting while ignoring the obvious risks.<br /><br />Paranoid<br />Refuse help from, or refuse to help an ally when you could have.

        <p>I like it. When would it trigger?</p>

        <p>You might consider adapting some of the stress results from the amazing <b>Darkest Dungeon</b> game.</p>

        <p>That&#39;s the first place I looked. The problem is converting them to interesting objectives to be fulfilled in the game.</p>

        <p>Are you looking specifically for moves?<br /><br />These look like they fit well were the Bonds would be. In other words, use them to receive additional XP. This could incentify the players</p>

        <p>Possibly relevant:  I&#39;ve got this backburner project, a PbtA game about adventurers-as-special forces in a fantasy world war. <br /><br />One of the things I wanted to get at was how the stress the PCs endured in the field wreaked long-term changes on their psyche.<br /><br />To that end, each playbook has keys (alignment/drive moves, basically, though they get triggered <i>in play</i> rather than at the end of each session).  Each key had a tag: <i>noble</i>, <i>common</i>, <i>hard</i>, <i>weird</i>, and <i>dark</i>.  <br /><br />For example, the soldier picks 2 keys from this list to start:<br />□ <b>Guardian</b> (noble) - defend an innocent from harm <br />□ <b>Honor</b> (noble) - fulfill a promise made to an NPC <br />□ <b>Jester</b> (common) - raise the spirits of your fellows through your antics or optimism <br />□ <b>Loyalty</b> (common) - stand up for or make excuses for a friend or comrade <br />□ <b>Revelry</b> (common) - indulge in sordid <br />pleasures (drink, dice, sex, etc.) with another <br />□ <b>Bitter Duty</b> (hard) - follow a direct order from a superior against your better judgment <br />□ <b>War-Brother’s Rivalry</b> (hard) - drop more foes in a fight than any other PC<br /><br />There are more keys out there. For example:<br /><br />□ Curator (weird) - add a notable specimen to your collection<br />□ Brutality (dark) - inflict great pain or lasting suffering on a foe<br /><br /><br />Anyhow... the relevant thing here is that there&#39;s a downtime move, between missions, where you can &quot;burn&quot; a key to effectively go without rest &amp; recovery between missions.  <br /><br />And when you burn a key, you have to replace it. Noble keys can&#39;t be replaced with noble keys.  Common keys must be replaced with weird, hard, or dark keys.  Weird or hard keys must be replaced by dark keys.  <br /><br />The intent being that, over the course of play, a PC that kept getting put into the fray would get harder/weirder/darker over time.</p>
