This idea came from Jeremy Strandbergâ€™s Would-Be Hero, and I tried expanding it into a more defensive/avenging riff on the Paladin. Iâ€™m not crazy about the result; thereâ€™s too many mechanical moves and too few fictional moves. Iâ€™d like to swap some of the former for the latter, if anyone wants to offer suggestions.

        <p>The Alignment and Race items are great. I love the narrative feel of I&#39;ll Be There For You, and the option to escape is great, but I personally find Bond to be the weakest part of DW. If it works for you, great, but I wouldn&#39;t base the move on it. Instead, I would give something like D&amp;D5e&#39;s Advantage. Basically, they get hold to spend to roll twice and take the best result (whenever aiding their ward in some way).</p>

        <p>&quot;Losing your ward&quot; means that they no longer count as your ward for the purposes of other moves.<br /><br />+2 armor forward is treated like any other +X forward, it lasts for one effect.<br /><br />As worded, I would rule it still a failure.Â <br /><br />Both Staunch Defender and Hard to Kill are on the chopping block for moves that I&#39;d like to replace with something more fictionally exciting.</p>

        <p>It feels fictionally strange that your promise to protect goes away when you&#39;re sleepy, I&#39;d imagine you&#39;d take -1/-2 forward until you get a proper rest.<br /><br />I think there&#39;s a place in your 2-5 list for a move that lets you get a move from another class, that kind of move has been popular with my players.<br /><br />You might consider...<br /><br />Final Stand:<br />When you take your Last Breath in defence of your ward, roll+CON instead.</p>

        <p><br /><b>Ever Loyal</b><br />This move seems a little out of the ordinary. A human and a Dwarf will both need sleep.  Perhaps <b>Sleep with one eye Open</b> would suite better?  Maybe give you the opportunity to Defy Danger +INT while you sleep?ï»¿<br /><br />P.S.<br /><b>Just bring it</b> has a spelling error. You is supposed to be Your</p>
