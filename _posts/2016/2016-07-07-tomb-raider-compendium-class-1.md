Tomb Raider Compendium Class 1.0c<br /><br />Let me know what you think...<br /><br />If you survive an expedition to raid a tomb of great lethality and historic importance you may take the following move when you next level up:<br /><br />You are a Tomb Raider. When you spout lore or discern realities about ancient tombs, take +1.<br /><br />When you pick locks and detect or ancient disable traps, roll+DEX. On a 10+, you do it, no problem. On a 7-9, you still do it, but the GM will offer you two options between a cost, danger, and suspicion. A Thief or character that has the class ability to pick locks or disarm traps gains a +2 on all such ability rolls when in a tombs, dungeons, tombs, crypts or catacombs.<br /><br />Once you&#39;ve taken the moves above the following moves count as class moves for you. In addition to your normal list of moves you may choose from this list when you level up:<br /><br />Scholar of Unlife: You may turn undead as if you were a cleric. A holy symbol is not required.<br /><br />True Vision: You gain the ability to automatically detect secret doors, see invisible creatures and detect shapeshifters and Illusions.<br /><br />Tomb Wary: You’re never caught by surprise in ruins, dungeons, tombs, crypts or catacombs. When an enemy or trap would get the drop on you, you get to act first instead.<br /><br />Dice with Death: If you take your last breath and either miss or refuse Death’s bargain, you can still come back to life; but may only use this ability once.

        <p>I would suggest guiding the player and GM more with Scholar of Unlife and True Vision to establish how these abilities work fictionally... something like, &quot;Tell the Gm how this works and where/how you gained this powers.&quot; I&#39;ll add too that not linking the turn undead ability to an object like a holy symbol makes it a bit stronger. A Cleric can lose their holy symbol--I&#39;ve seen it happen.<br /><br />It seems like the starting move is really two moves: a spout lore bonus, and then a move that mirrors Tricks of the Trade, but only for &quot;ancient&quot; stuff (also you need to flip the words ancient and disable). It seems like a lot to give someone for one move. More importantly, the +2 bonus for Thieves would basically make them never fail. It might be better if you had them jump a step, i.e. a 6- becomes a 7-9, or give them a special on a 12+ bonus.</p>
