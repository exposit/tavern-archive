Do you have any tool for Fronts and other game planning for Dungeon World? Don&#39;t need anything fancy. Excel sheet or the like would do it.<br /><br />I know there&#39;s a sample sheet on the official site, but I was looking more for a version I could digitally work with on my computer.<br /><br />Thanks!

        <p>I recently wrote an adventure using Google Doc, and made use of headings and the auto-generated table of contents. Means I can jump around the document during play. There&#39;s not much to fronts to require anything fancy IMO.ï»¿<br /><br />Bonus is that I can read/edit it in my phone, using Google Drive.</p>

I&#39;m thinking about making something similar and would love to see how you started yours!</p>

        <p>Here&#39;s what I wrote in ~40min after reading the One Page Dungeon, &quot;A Stolen Spring&quot;. This prep means I&#39;m ready to run a single session adventure, with plenty of interesting stakes. Some bits are still in my head, I&#39;ll try and add them this weekend:<br /><br /><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1P0gjwhtJHMVbk_Ad_A8uVwc2wofl54ZpmHUlkXn4aK0/edit" class="ot-anchor">https://docs.google.com/document/d/1P0gjwhtJHMVbk_Ad_A8uVwc2wofl54ZpmHUlkXn4aK0/edit</a></p>

        <p>They&#39;re both pretty simple but very great and effective! I tend to overcomplicate when I prep! Thx a lot! </p>

        <p>No worries. For me, it&#39;s all about having &quot;things in motion&quot; during play. That&#39;s why I love DW&#39;s Fronts so much. Lots of questions for the players to answer during play.</p>
