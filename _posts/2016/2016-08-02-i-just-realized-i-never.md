I just realized I never posted a link to Episode 26 of DR to the Tavern. This one includes a very fun little story and interview with <span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink" href="https://plus.google.com/117582566260906817417" oid="117582566260906817417">Tor Droplets</a></span> from Pocket-Sized Play and his son Wind (in addition to all the normal sorts of things we do). Enjoy!

        <p><span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink" href="https://plus.google.com/108530078404383929502" oid="108530078404383929502">Jason Cordova</a></span> I enjoyed the discussion about the Discern Realities/Spout Lore moves in the episode.  One thing I would have liked discussed more: when a player asks a Discern Realities question, how often/appropriate it is for the GM to reply with &quot;nothing&quot; if they have nothing in mind?<br /><br />Like, when a player asks &quot;what here is not as it appears to be,&quot; should that be an invitation for the GM to actually seriously consider changing things so that there is indeed something here that isn&#39;t what it appears to be, even though they hadn&#39;t thought to do so it before?<br /><br />Perhaps a topic of discussion for a future podcast :)</p>

I&#39;m not sure there&#39;s a great answer, except to say you can usually distinguish between a player being truly interested in some aspect of the color you had not previously considered, and a player who is just trying to turn over every rock. In the former case, I&#39;m more open to the possibility that some cool, unforeseen storytelling might happen, in which case I might try to come up with something on the fly or turn it over to the table for discussion. In the latter case, it&#39;s easier to say &#39;nothing, let&#39;s move on,&#39; because the players themselves are probably not too invested in the answer. I guess it&#39;s more of an art than a science.</p>
