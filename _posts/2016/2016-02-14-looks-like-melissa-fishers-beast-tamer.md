        <p>one that was rattling around in my head was the pokemon esc evolution<br /><br />somehow through magic/potions/science, <br />you are able to &quot;evolve&quot; the creature<br /><br />give your bear wings<br />your horse extra legs<br /><br />some sort of move ala the druid where you gain so much hold to use thier new evolution to your advantage which is reset after make camp/or something simular (lore wise, the creauture can only use so much as its a new feature and it tires them/is hard<br /><br />also i still really like the idea of a pokeball type scenario, so you can capture creatures and carry multiple that can be called when needed<br /><br />which ofc means there must be a reason you can have 20 out at a time etc..<br /><br />so MAAAYBE its like a item that captures them, and can only summon them 1 at a time as it links you mentally or something<br /><br />but ofc there needs to be a limited use &quot;SUMMON ALL THE MONSTERS!&quot; move you can use every so often for big effect<br /><br />also should have a version of the theif&#39;s posions, but instead its like animal buffs/potions, (totally pokemon sprays) so you can increase thier speed/strength etc.. maybe at cost or even risk the spray does something else / effects more than just your creature</p>
