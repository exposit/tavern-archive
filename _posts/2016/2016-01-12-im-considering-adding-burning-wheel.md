I&#39;m considering adding Burning Wheel style &#39;wises&#39; to persistent hirelings- broad based competencies like &#39;sailing-wise&#39; or &#39;hunting-wise&#39; which could present players with a topical +1 to Spout Lore when consulting the hireling in question. Any thoughts? Cautions? The idea is to encourage players to interact with party followers and help flesh out persistent NPC companions.

        <p>Do you have the Perilous Wilds?  <br /><br />The follower rules there give every follower a &quot;wise&quot; tag. They can roll+Quality to Spout Lore on your behalf about in that wise. Or they can assist you, granting a +1 to your own role.</p>

        <p>Kismet! That&#39;s awesome. I&#39;d heard that there were new follower rules- I&#39;ll go check it out. Thank you.</p>

        <p>These are great, I might substitute the whole Perilous Wilds hireling ruleset in!</p>

        <p>I asked Jeremy if I could include his follower rules in TPW because I loved how they worked when I tested them out with my group. That small increase in mechanical weight brings with it a greater narrative weight, and in our game NPCs that felt slight became suddenly more solid.<br /><br />Since then I&#39;ve gotten a better handle on how to manage *World NPCs, but I can&#39;t imagine not using those follower rules for all of my DW games. </p>

        <p>Yeah, so true. I treat every NPC as a potential follower and just embellish as needed. They always have a name and a knack / quirk.<br /><br />I&#39;m pretty broad with the <b>Recruit</b> trigger <br /> &#39;When you go looking to hire help, tell the GM what you’re offering and whom you’re looking for&#39;<br />The Help can be transient, or a &#39;one off&#39;, rather than a full blown follower in the traditional sense. It builds a certain PC reputation too, based on how they deal with the greater unwashed of our particular Dungeon World.<br /><br />It gives the Bard some really cool fictional weight via their moves too.</p>
