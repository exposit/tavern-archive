Here&#39;s a race playbook I&#39;ve had bubbling away for a while just in case one of my players wanted to use it....<br /><br />The Medusa<br /><br />Good: Steer events towards a glorious and fair future.<br /><br />Neutral: Dispassionately move through Time, serving your own whims.<br /><br />Chaotic: Toy with the mortal world for your amusement.<br /><br />Evil: Drag the mortal world toward the ruination it deserves.<br /><br />Starting Moves:<br /><br />Ancient. As one of the ancient ones, you take +1 ongoing to Spout Lore about historic events you were present for. On a 7-9, explain a negative result of your involvement.<br /><br />Serpentine Hair: your hair is a mixture of venomous rattlesnakes and verdant adders. The rattlesnakes will bite any target close enough if you wish. You can sever an adder to take 1d6 damage in order to heal an ally 1d8 with the resulting juices.<br /><br />Stone Cold Stare: When you gaze directly into someone&#39;s eyes, you risk turning them to stone. Shun your reflection, and avoid meeting the eyes of those you love.<br /><br />Eyes On Me: When you will your hair to hiss and rattle along with your words, roll+CHA. On a 7+, the target will be compelled to look at you. On a 7-9, it was a fleeting glance, the petrification will only last an hour. On a 10+, they are a permanent stone statue.<br /><br />Choose the one class you appreciate the most. Whenever you gain a level, you may take one starting or advanced move from that class. Describe where you learned these skills.

        <p>How about this nerfed revision?<br /><br />Eyes On Me: When you will your hair to hiss and rattle along with your words, roll+CHA. On a 7+, the target will be compelled to look at you. On a 7-9, it was a fleeting glance, their paralysis will only last Charisma minutes. On a 10+, they are petrified for CHA hours. On a 12+, they are a permanent stone statue. The stone is so heavy and solid, hiding the evidence is going to be difficult.</p>

        <p>On a 6-, you caught sight of your reflection in their eyes...The paralysis affects you in some way...</p>
