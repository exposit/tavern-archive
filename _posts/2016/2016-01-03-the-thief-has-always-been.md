The Thief has always been one of my favorite classes, but DW&#39;s Thief playbook didn&#39;t really do it for me. A lot of the base playbooks suffer from the &quot;+1 forward&quot; syndrome, and there are a lot of combos that can make the PCs invincible or capable of dealing insane damage. So I tried a little &quot;remix&quot; of the Thief playbook, just to test the waters. If this is popular, I may do some others.

        <p>I see you added Cutthroat, Assassin, Silvertongued, and Shadow Stalker, and improved Backstab and Trap Expert.  Not sure what you did to reduce &quot;+1 forward syndrome&quot; or to make the character less capable of combos or insane damage (besides, isn&#39;t that the Fighter?)</p>

        <p>Fair enough. I was thinking about +1 syndrome when I was planning out a revised Paladin. What I did was add some utility that I felt the Thief didn&#39;t have, got rid of a couple of moves that had very limited utility, and tried to lessen the over-reliance on Dex.</p>

        <p>May i suggest a version with origin and motivation instead of races/alignment? <br />What about a death move?</p>

        <p>Shadow Stalker or something like it is definitely missing from the RAW thief.  Pondering the replacement of Trap Expert (DEX) with Danger Sense (WIS), I <i>think</i> I like it.  It&#39;s good to have a signal to the young thief that WIS is actually an important stat for them.<br /><br />I&#39;m not sure about buffing Backstab so that it always does +1d6 damage. I&#39;d have to see how that plays.  I suppose +1d6 is almost always one of the choices picked, so that the net effect is to give an additional choice, likely +1 forward or -1 armor.  Which is not huge – I&#39;m just not sure it&#39;s necesssary.<br /><br />I&#39;d be curious to see in play if Assassin+Envenom was too good a combo.  Assassin lets you make an attack on an unaware target from range, ie, an auto-hit.  Envenom would let you apply the sleep oil to the blade.  Being able to take out any one foe at range <b>without a roll</b> is powerful – not sure how easy it would be to abuse.  <br /><br />All the other improvements seem good.  The remaining utility that still seems badly missing is Climb Walls.  I might suggest that Connections is now somewhat redundant with Honor Among Thieves, so you could ditch that and replace it with a spider monkey move.</p>

        <p>Thanks for the feedback! <br /><br />My reasoning behind including both Connections and Honor Among Thieves is that Connections gets you things, whereas Honor Among Thieves puts you into contact with a person. As written though, I can see how there could be overlap.<br /><br />Good catch on the Envenom/Assassin combo. I&#39;ll have to reconsider that.</p>

        <p>I quite like it. I&#39;d either reduce the bass health or hit die though. He just feels like a deceiving fighter instead of a sneaky glass cannon.</p>
