So I have something to share. I commissioned a friend to draw my character for my first Dungeon World Campaign I&#39;m going to be in! She is a Halfling Druid. It starts tonight and I&#39;m super excited!<br /><br />All fear The MIGHTY NEMA!

        <p>so I had Nema take the animal companion advance from the ranger list via her Druid advance move &quot;hunter&#39;s brother&quot; for her first advance. We had just defeated a wyvern so we&#39;re walking in its cave and the gm says &quot;you find lots of gold and gems and an egg&quot; and then he was like &quot;do you want a wyvern for your animal companion?&quot; &quot;And I was like YES!&quot; So now I have.....<br /><br />This little guy<br /><br /><a href="http://obsidianshade.deviantart.com/art/Bad-baby-Naruga-cub-175470820" class="ot-anchor">http://obsidianshade.deviantart.com/art/Bad-baby-Naruga-cub-175470820</a><br /><br />Who will grow into.......<br /><br />THIS GUY!!!!<br /><br /><a href="http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/monsterhunter/images/3/32/2ndGen-Nargacuga_Artwork_003.png/revision/latest?cb=20150316034951" class="ot-anchor">http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/monsterhunter/images/3/32/2ndGen-Nargacuga_Artwork_003.png/revision/latest?cb=20150316034951</a><br /><br />O.O<br />Did not expect this but it&#39;s AWESOME! So the Tiny Tiny Mighty Nema now has an equally mighty animal companion! Well it&#39;s not all that mighty right now, It&#39;s still tiny too.<br />But it WILL be<br />SOON.......<br />I feel like Khalisi right now tbh.<br />SOON MY NOT A DRAGON BUT KIND OF STILL A DRAGON WILL BE BADASS AND AMAZING!</p>

        <p>You&#39;re welcome, young one! Old Eli looks forward to seeing you two grow strong together and will look on as a guide. Do well by that creature and it will show you true greatness.<br /><br />I love that you used nargacuga for your wyvern. Monster Hunter is so good and that monster is one of my favorites. Rathalos would have been too spiky to ride anyway.</p>
