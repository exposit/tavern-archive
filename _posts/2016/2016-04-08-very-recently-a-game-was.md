Very recently, a game was released by an acquaintance of mine: Fellowship.Â <br /><br />A take on Tolkien style adventuring, this original and very interesting title takes some interesting steps and includes some awesome features most people wouldn&#39;t expect from a tabletop game.<br /><br />Since I&#39;ve been following the game for a while, playtested it, and know the creator a tad, I decided to give it a shoutout on my site. If you&#39;re interested in the title, I go into some reasons why I think its awesome.Â <br /><br />As the game was made by someone who made a lot of good, third-party Dungeon World classes and was greatly inspired by the title in the making of this game, I thought some people here might be interested in it.Â

Just yesterday, Fellowship launched on Drivethrurpg. Developed by an acquaintance of mine, the title has been on my radar for quite a while and is an awesome game.

        <p>Interesting - I&#39;d just started listening to the audio drama again, so it&#39;e peaked my interest</p>
