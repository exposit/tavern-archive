        <p>While I haven&#39;t gotten a chance to try them in a game, two of my favorites are from the early supplement Sarrenor. While they could be used in any setting, they&#39;re also super evocative and show how much custom moves can produce setting and tone by themselves:<br /><br />The Crow Road<br /><br />Nobody knows who placed the statues that mark the Crow Road, their beaks and tails pointing the way. The Crow Road is never the safest way to travel, but is often the quickest. Some say it passes through Death’s Kingdom, and indeed many die on this treacherous path. But those who survive it often find their journey significantly shortened.<br /><br />When you travel the Crow Road, roll (just roll, +nothing). You always encounter danger. On a 10+ choose both options. On a 7-9, choose 1.<br /><br />• The danger is challenging, but something you know how to survive<br />• The road ends somewhere safe and convenient, reducing travel time<br /><br /><br />Wayshrines<br /><br />Wayshrines dot lonely stretches of road through the wilderness. It is good luck to relight wayshrines and leave offerings of food, water or supplies when you have plenty and bad luck to take when you need not.<br /><br />When you leave an offering at a wayshrine, roll+uses of the offering given, and +1 more if you relight the wayshrine. On a 10+, hold 3. On a 7-9, hold 1. Spend your hold to add to your roll to Undertake a Perilous Journey in this area, or when you take a mundane item from a wayshrine.<br /><br />When you take a mundane item from a wayshrine, roll+hold. On a 10+ the wayshrine has just what you need. On a 7-9 there’s something close and someone’s left a note about how to find what you really need.<br /><br />When you take from a wayshrine when not in dire need, take -1 forward and roll to Undertake a Perilous Journey as you travel onward.</p>

        <p>I like the idea of having a bunch of interesting custom moves available at the beginning of a campaign, and allowing players to choose from them as part of the worldbuilding.</p>

        <p>Was watching a podcast, and the talked about a move called &quot;Explore Labyrinth.&quot;<br />Greatest move ever if you want to have a large dungeon, without having to actually map it out.<br /><br />When you explore a dungeon, explain to the GM your method for navigation. Roll+ stat (GM will decided what).<br /><br />On 12+, gain 2 hold.<br />On 10+, gain 1 hold.<br />On 7-9, gain 1 hold, but also encounter a guardian.<br />On -6, lose all hold and encounter a guardian.<br /><br />Spend 1 hold to find a treasure room. Players will tell you what kind of treasure it is, and the room it is in. (Make sure you decided how many treasure rooms there are total for them to exploit)<br />Spend X hold (OG used 3 in his example), to find the final goal. I.E. end of the maze, Dracula&#39;s inner sanctum, ect.</p>
