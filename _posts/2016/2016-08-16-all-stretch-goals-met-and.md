We met all Stretch Goals and keep growing on the last 24 hours! More below.It seems you don'n know what the word final stretch goal means, right? Wow, we just blow through all of them. A.L.L. Its way beyond our most daring hopes and we are realy thankfull to all of you who made this possible.Our Backer Charles Ulveling, who frequently discussed with us within the comments, suggested to do a giant file with all maps aligned for a "Complete Print"...
