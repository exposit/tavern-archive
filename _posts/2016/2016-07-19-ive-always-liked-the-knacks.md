I&#39;ve always liked the knacks and instincts from dungeon world, and have incorporated them into my prep for other systems I GM, namely, right now, D&amp;D. So I wanted to share some of my stuff. One of the knacks that I ended up liking the most that I came up for for these minor NPCs was &#39;To experience PTSD&#39;.<br /><br />Matthias (M halfling) and Iris (F human)<br />Two young orphans, former slaves purchased by Beetel during their travels. Iris is solemn and serious, a poet and writer, while Matthias is an eagerly inquisitive soul and quick learner, with natural talent on and off the stage. They too owe much to beetel and the other members of the troop.<br />Matthias (Carefree Younger Brother)<br />Instinct:to do something remarkably well, to be happy, to be enthusiastic,to act without thinking, to be courageous<br />Knack: Natural Talent, Fierce Loyalty<br /><br />Iris (Worried Older Sister Archetype scarred from time as slaves)<br />Instinct: to experience PTSD, to worry, to look for help, to keep a journal, to immortalize moments in writing<br />Knack:The mind of a Writer, the caution of an escaped slave,<br />Flaw: Mistrusts everyone but Beetel and the troupe. And that took months or years.
