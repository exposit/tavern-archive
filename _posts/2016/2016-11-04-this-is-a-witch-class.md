This is a Witch class I wrote and it&#39;s the first time I do such thing. Feel free to use it if you like it, in exchange I only ask for some feedback. Thank you.

        <p>The witch alignments seem to imply only generically evil storybook witches. I think a witch playbook that is more generically playable can be useful. Perhaps alignments more like this?<br /><br />Chaotic: Exploit a weakness of law or civilization.<br /><br />Evil: Install fear of the spirits of darkness and shadows.<br /><br />Good: Help eliminate an evil threat in the world.<br /><br />(Haven&#39;t had a chance to look much deeper yet)</p>

        <p>I agree with <span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink" href="https://plus.google.com/105691132767402178467" oid="105691132767402178467">Tomer Gurantz</a></span>, I was thinking about a Good alignment too.<br /><br />Also, as written this Witch can&#39;t be played as the super hottie who charms men into doing her bidding. <br /><br />Finally, I personally don&#39;t like the Human ability. Manipulating a child is a common trope for a witch, but I would steer away from it, even in this fictional game we play.<br /><br />I think you have a typo. For Soul Bound you have &quot;your familiar merges into your familiar...&quot; I&#39;m assuming you mean &quot;your familiar merges into you&quot;.<br /><br />Very cool otherwise and I may use it at some point. Keep us updated on any changes you make!</p>

        <p>When designing moves you want to make sure that though they specialize in something that doesn&#39;t step on the toes of the base play books. You do want to have a few that are more generalized in application.<br /><br />for example I am making a bow/magic witch hunter class. The very first iteration of it was scrapped because fighting magic was all he could do. Which might sound fine at first, but when you realize &quot;well what do they do if there is no magic around?&quot; you realize it&#39;s a poorly thought out play book.<br />so make sure you consider what they can do outside their element, not just what they specialize in.</p>

        <p>HP is usually damage die+CON. So you would have 4+CON HP.</p>

In the book on page 89, Cleric is 8+CON with d6 dmg die (although the playbook I have shows 6&amp;6, so I guess I&#39;ll go by the book) and on page 135 Thief is 6+CON and d8 die.<br /><br /><span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink" href="https://plus.google.com/117601525779363207299" oid="117601525779363207299">Patrick Schenk</a></span>, I&#39;ve only tried twice to make a new class and did exactly the same thing both times, which was over specialize. When we see a witch on TV or a movie we ONLY see their tropes because the movie is about our heroes, not the witch. I know that&#39;s why I&#39;ve designed that way in the past. I&#39;ve tried to simulate what I&#39;ve seen in a movie, rather than thinking outside that small box that maybe was only on screen for 7 or 8 minutes total.</p>

I&#39;d also take the charming beauty stuff out of FF.<br /><br />Then I&#39;d make another advanced move called something like Lustful Beauty:  When you morph into a beautiful maiden, take +1 forward to Parley with a male character, and the leverage is you.<br /><br /> The idea there being that she is so hot he&#39;ll do whatever she wants in hopes of getting with her.<br /><br />Then you can make additional moves that require Lustful Beauty. <br /><br />My thinking behind that is that it will give your witch multiple &quot;paths&quot; to follow during progression.<br /><br />Very rough I know,  but maybe a good starting point.</p>

        <p>Understood. I read witch as female, but you mean warlock as well, correct?<br /><br />I feel both male or female could play both roles. Lustful Beauty could then say &quot;character of the opposite sex&quot; rather than &quot;male character&quot;. It gives the player the choice.<br /><br />Thoughts?</p>

        <p>In regards to tropes, it&#39;s nice to look at misunderstood witches (instead of only those that are judged by the commoners as evil), for example when you look at the main character in Wicked (the play about the &quot;wicked&quot; witch from Oz)</p>

Because life intervened the only player I had was the guy I WANTED to play the Witch, so we tried something different.<br /><br />I went into it with the idea that this Witch would end up being a villain at some point. He loved the idea and played the hell out of it.<br /><br />Maximillia&#39;s Grim Master is Sirrush (a quick internet search got him this name...in Babylonian mythology, a dragon who is a symbol of chaos), whose domain is Anarchy. Her companion is a snake named Whiro (from the same dragon webpage he found Sirrush... this one from Polynesian mythology, a symbol of death and evil).<br /><br />Long story short, Maximillia cursed the town&#39;s well with the idea that all the town&#39;s troubles are the mayor&#39;s fault (whom just happens to be a loyal supporter of the main characters&#39; patron - Duke Regibald).<br /><br />She Soul Bound into horror to kill a caravan entering the town with needed supplies, and then into a charming beauty to convince the captain of the town&#39;s guard to take the mayor prisoner.<br /><br />At the end, so used a nerve toxin (inhalation) that killed several townsfolk protesting against the mayor at the jail house. It thoroughly convinced the bystanders that the mayor was an evil sorcerer and they killed him. Maximillia was never suspected of witchcraft.<br /><br />A citizen whom thought that things weren&#39;t quite right was able to get a letter off to Duke Regibald. I&#39;m pretty sure he&#39;s going to send the party down to Logrun (Yeah, I totally based the town on Riverwood from Skyrim) to investigate :).<br /><br />It was a lot of fun, and Dave loves the Witch class.<br />Is there a way to private message with G+?<br />I&#39;d like to get your e-mail address so I can send you some minor tweaks that we used.</p>

        <p>Dave is my best roleplayer, so he deserves a lot of credit for how the story played out. I only have 2 sessions, MAYBE 3 left in the campaign, so I&#39;m setting some things up for the future.<br /><br />My next campaign will be set 20 or so years later in the same world, with the Witch as the big bad at the center of the Campaign Front (still working on details, but I&#39;ll wait and see what the players do with her when they meet up with her at Logrun). It will be interesting to see how the world has changed due to her taint over the last 20 years!<br /><br />I&#39;ll e-mail you when I get a chance. We made some minor tweaks - like saying Grim Fellowship &quot;Requires Jinx&quot; (instead of saying &quot;Select only if you have Jinx&quot;) - and changed the Human class (a couple times). We also changed the potion tag system a tad.<br /><br />Feel free to not use ANY of it LOL. It was just some minor changes that we came up with while using the class.</p>

I&#39;ll be happy to make some changes since you play tested this class!</p>
