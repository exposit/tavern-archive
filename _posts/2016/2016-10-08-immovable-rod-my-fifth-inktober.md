<b>Immovable Rod</b><br /><br />My fifth <a rel="nofollow" class="ot-hashtag" href="https://plus.google.com/s/%23Inktober/posts">#Inktober</a> drawing is a <a rel="nofollow" class="ot-hashtag" href="https://plus.google.com/s/%23DungeonWorld/posts">#DungeonWorld</a> immovable rod.<br /><br />I missed posting on Friday. I volunteered at two different functions and was on my feet for twelve hours. Needless to say there wasn&#39;t much time to draw.<br /><br />So, I tackled my first magic item, the immovable rod. I just love the idea of a simple rod with a button at one end that will stay where it is in space once the button is pressed and nothing move it. It struck me that a fun way to stumble across the rod would be coming across a well or vertical entrance to an underground complex with the rope of the party that last descended tied to the rod floating in place. Should you take the rod? What about the party down below? Why didn&#39;t the return? Why would they use the rob versus anchoring against the well? Should your party go down and fund out?<br /><br />I hope you like my attempt at drawing my take on this magic item from the core rulebook.<br /><br />I&#39;m participating in <a rel="nofollow" class="ot-hashtag" href="https://plus.google.com/s/%23Inktober/posts">#Inktober</a> this year leading up to the annual 24 hour <a rel="nofollow" class="ot-hashtag" href="https://plus.google.com/s/%23ExtraLife/posts">#ExtraLife</a> game marathon that I have been running in late October with my wife for the last five years. I&#39;m going to draw monsters, weapons, and magic items from the <a rel="nofollow" class="ot-hashtag" href="https://plus.google.com/s/%23DungeonWorld/posts">#DungeonWorld</a> rulebook and from the Dungeon World Codex (<a href="http://codex.dungeon-world.com" class="ot-anchor">http://codex.dungeon-world.com</a>). <br /><br />If you like the drawings and would like to support me in Extra Life this year, you can donate to my campaign at <a href="http://www.extra-life.org/participant/jimjones" class="ot-anchor">http://www.extra-life.org/participant/jimjones</a>.<br /><br />You have my sincere appreciation if you do.<br /><br />All the money that I raise goes directly to Riley Hospital for Children in Indianapolis, Indiana. My youngest daughter, Rogue, had a life saving cranial reconstruction surgery at Riley when she was just a little over one year old. Today, she is a happy and healthy almost six year old who is thriving in kindergarten. <br /><br />Let me know what you think. <br /><br />ï»¿

My fifth #Inktober drawing is a #DungeonWorld immovable rod.

I missed posting on Friday. I volunteered at two different functions and was on my feet for twelve hours. Needless to say there wasn't much time to draw.

So, I tackled my first magic item, the immovable rod. I just love the idea of a simple rod with a button at one end that will stay where it is in space once the button is pressed and nothing move it. It struck me that</a>

        <p>Anytime I give my group an immovable rod they immediately weaponize it. <br /><br />There is an ogre running at you, what do you do? <br />&quot;I point the immovable rod at it, press the button and step back.&quot;<br /><b>Sigh</b> The ogre runs through it and disembowels itself.<br /><br />The one awesome time this happened was when they were fighting a dragon that kept flying around and attacking from the air. They used a combination of the immovable rod and a magic rope to lasso it when it passed by, which resulted in the Dragon breaking it&#39;s own neck. It was pretty awesome.</p>

        <p>In our Pathfinder campaign the GM has an NPC traveling magician that we saved offer us each a magical item from a list.  <br /><br />When I didn&#39;t see an immovable rod on the list I had to ask if he had one somewhere in storage.  It turns out he didn&#39;t.  It was worth a try though.<br /><br />I&#39;ve always wanted to get a character&#39;s hands on one in a game.  <br /><br />Not yet.<br /><br />Great drawing too.</p>
