Hey folks, I&#39;ve got a question about my first Dungeon World campaign. I&#39;m new to the game, as are all my players, but we&#39;re super excited to start playing. Our campaign is going to have a lot of wilderness action (the setting includes a jungle the size of an ocean) and I know that people really recommend The Perilous Wilds for handling that stuff. <br /><br />Given that none of us have played before, would you recommend that we keep it simple and just use the base game, or is Perilous Wilds simple and straightforward enough that it will help make a wilderness-heavy campaign shine?<br /><br />Thanks for the help!

        <p>Hey, I&#39;d get <i>Perilous Wilds</i> because it is fairly simple and straightforward</p>

        <p>Isn&#39;t perilous wild just random encounter tables?</p>

        <p>I would recommend it, for this sort of game. Core DW does not particularly cater to hexcrawl-esque play; PW changes that. If that&#39;s what you want (which it sounds like you do), it&#39;s great. On the other hand, if you&#39;re playing a game where exploration should not be important, I would say you definitely <b>wouldn&#39;t</b> want to use PW--or at least PW&#39;s travel moves.</p>

        <p>Hmm... So I did pick up the book and I like a lot of what&#39;s in it. But this campaign doesn&#39;t feel like it&#39;s shaping up to be a hexcrawl, so maybe the travel moves wouldn&#39;t be appropriate. I&#39;ll think on it and then run it by my players.<br /></p>

        <p>In this campaign, do you go to a place where adventure happens, or does a lot of adventure happen along the way?<br /><br />You could just use PW&#39;s travel rules when you want to zoom in on the journey, and just use the regular DW move if you want to quickly summarize it.</p>

        <p>When you put it that way, it feels like adventure will happen on the way.</p>

        <p>I&#39;d recommend getting Perilous Wilds BUT also keeping it simple. PW has some rules changes and a LOT of random tables and die rolling. I only turn to it when I&#39;m stuck or looking for inspiration. It&#39;s a good supplement but if you are all new to the game I&#39;d stick with the core rule book, maybe add what you like from other supplements.</p>

        <p>It&#39;s looking like we&#39;ll be using the alternate travel rules, but I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll be relying on the random table too much, except for some inspiration and last-minute ass-covering. Waiting to see if our Ranger wants to use the alternate, Follower-style animal companion. Thanks for the advice folks!</p>

        <p>To save time with the tables, you might want to make use of this generator: <a href="https://gitlab.com/phrakture/perlious-wilds" class="ot-anchor">https://gitlab.com/phrakture/perlious-wilds</a></p>
