Since AW has upgraded to 2nd Edition, is there any chance DW will be getting a 3rd Ed?

        <p>It would need to get a second, first.</p>

        <p>Why? AW&#39;s moves don&#39;t affect DW&#39;s moves, AW&#39;s please don&#39;t affects DW&#39;s playbooks, AW&#39;s vehicle combat didn&#39;t find into play in DW.<br /><br />What do you think would carry over?</p>

        <p>DW is independent from AW. AW e2 =/= DW e2.<br /><br />If they make a new rule book, it would be second edition not third.</p>

        <p>Nope. And I don&#39;t think theres a need for DW 2e. Nothing needs to be changed with that fantastic game in my opinion.</p>

        <p>There was an older &quot;Red Book&quot; version of DW that was sold for a relatively short period of time.  It was sort of like &quot;Basic:&quot; only 4 classes (5 with an expansion), a starter adventure in the book, but no other monsters or steadings or gear lists or anything.<br /><br />One could easily take that as a &quot;first&quot; edition. But it was always meant as something incomplete, a prelude to the final product.</p>

        <p>I mean, if they want to revise or add content and kickstart a fancy new book with a fancy leather cover or something I&#39;d definitely buy it, but the game is pretty awesome as is, and it certainly doesn&#39;t seem to require much work at the moment.</p>

        <p>More useful work would be to compile, organise and catalogue the thousands of fan made additions and hacks. There&#39;s tremendous amounts of content out there but it requires some digging.</p>

        <p>There was a prank run by the devs at one point about a second edition (april&#39;s fool I think) so that might be were the rumor comes from.</p>

        <p>They are on a second <b>printing</b> I believe. I say this because I had to wait a while before I could get a print copy, back when I first tried to buy it...</p>

        <p>I&#39;ve got a few houserules, but other than that, I don&#39;t see the need for a whole edition</p>
