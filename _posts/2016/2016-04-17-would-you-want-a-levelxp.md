Would you want a Level/XP &quot;widget&quot; like this on a character sheet rather than the traditional blanks? Would you &quot;widgetize&quot; xp differently?

        <p>That&#39;s a lot of real estate for pretty shallow information that I don&#39;t find especially interesting, but it would save a lot of erasing, so... maybe. If I did, though, I&#39;d rotate it so you&#39;re filling in bubbles from left to right instead of top to bottom. Top to bottom feels weird, like it&#39;s growing in the wrong direction.</p>

        <p>I&#39;d run 125 boxes in a single column up the side of an 11&#39; piece of paper. It&#39;d be a little less than a 1/10 of an inch high per box. At each level mark, I&#39;d put the number along side. People would fill from bottom to top, forming a single solid bar, and circle the level once they get there / make the move.<br /><br />Basically, it&#39;d be like a height chart as your character grew up, and would take a lot less real estate.</p>

        <p>Tons of wasted space for me.<br />At each given level you got past information (cross dots) who dont serve any purpose and future information (blank ones) that will be helpful someday but not now.<br />Perhaps just one column of dots... but i really prefer a little place to put marks, and use the space in the sheet for really useful things (equipment, clues, information, NPCs, places...)</p>

        <p>I&#39;d like that but it seems it would take some precious space. I really like the layout of the official playbooks. For example of you were to fit it in the official playbook, where would you put it?</p>

        <p>What about having only 10 circles and having a square for &quot;tens&quot;. I would also reuse the range circles each level by erasing the check marks in them after leveling up. </p>

        <p>Hardcoding the XP-per-level into a character sheet makes it harder for a game to house rule the advancement rate. Or, if they have house ruled it, they&#39;re not going to want to use this version of the playbooks. <br /><br />Aside from that: I like Ryan Abram&#39;s version; the &quot;steps&quot; approach takes up too much space.</p>

        <p>I like the idea. No caveats, no adjustments, just straight up like it. Dungeon World sheets have very little info in my opinion (I&#39;m used to Pathfinder and Shadowrun, where you don&#39;t have a sheet but a booklet), so something like this would be fine.<br /><br />Only thing I&#39;d want to see changed, and this was after setting and looking for something for a few minutes, would be to make the black space white so you could put notes or a picture there.</p>

        <p>Thanks everyone for the feedback. Obviously I&#39;m working on something but it&#39;s not fully baked yet.

        <p>It&#39;s nice, but not really for me. It would just take up too much space. I use an OpenOffice template that I made to create new sheets for players since we make use of the Class Warfare supplement for DW. I also use Luck from Freebooters. My problem has been trying to use as little space as possible to keep it down to one page sheets (not including spells sheets).<br /><br />When I do have extra space, I prefer to place something more along the lines of character portraits on the sheet.</p>

        <p>I&#39;m thinking more like a VP track on boardgames would be good.  A border around the entire sheet with marks at the level increases.</p>

        <p>I&#39;ve always found it&#39;s best to come up with a visual, no matter how error laden and rough, when proposing design ideas - it&#39;s much easier to explain a visual idea with an image.</p>

        <p>Well, I actually showed this to one of my players who came by for a visit while I was looking through some Google+ stuff, and he liked it. So I&#39;m going to show it to the rest of my players. If they like it as well, I&#39;ll compromise with them and print the widget on 4x6 index cards that I can hand out at the end of session, or that they can keep with their sheets.<br /><br />Hey, if it&#39;s a funner way to do XP? Why not? The more fun to be had, the better. And it&#39;ll actually save a little room on the character sheets.</p>

        <p>Just for your info, older &quot;WIP&quot; edition of DW included such a thing in their playbooks.
