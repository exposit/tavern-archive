        <p>Kids can be scary :)<br /><br />Some quotes from a friend&#39;s six-year-old daughter playing a recent game of Talisman:<br /><br />&quot;No, I want to be evil!&quot;<br />&quot;Yes yes!  I got to the graveyard and pray to the Dark Gods!&quot;<br />&quot;Why can&#39;t I turn my unicorn into gold? It&#39;s not fair!&quot;<br />&quot;Can the Dark Gods turn my unicorn into gold?&quot;<br />&quot;Why are the vampires attacking me?  I&#39;m evil too!!  It&#39;s not fair&quot;<br />(Her father) Well, it says here you can give them your followers...<br />(delighted that a solution has presented itself at last) &quot;Yes yes!  I feed them my unicorn!!&quot;<br /><br />She won the game.</p>
