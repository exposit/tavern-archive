This is a very abstract simple way of calculating how much gear you can carry.  Each player gets a 3x5 index card to write what gear they have.  They can only carry as much gear as they can write on the the card.  Small writing = organized packing.  Reason and fiction will keep people from packing halberds and ten foot poles in a satchel.  Paper tearing or getting punctured from writing represents the bag breaking.  Saddlebags and chests are represented by index cards where you can write on both sides as well as have room for bigger things in the fiction.  If your more artsy.  You can draw the items on the card and use bigger paper.  This method is focused on fun and simplicity rather than technical strategy or realism.  It&#39;s worked well for me and my players.<br />

        <p>When you add a rule to the game, the rule should have a purpose.  When you add a new rule to change an existing game, it should address some issue that you&#39;d like to change.<br /><br />I read this rule, and the only issue i can think you&#39;re trying to change is that DW doesn&#39;t include enough gear micromanagement.  Which is fine; if you and your players want gear micromanagement, then have at it.<br /><br />But one of the first aspects of DW that i found completely divergent from my prior games was the simplistic elegance of &quot;Adventuring Gear&quot; - this game was all about having fun on the fly with little micromanagement.  As long as you have uses of Adventuring Gear, of course you have (and have always had on you) a lamp, or a rope, or some fishing line, or.. whatever you want (within the confines of mundane adventuring gear!).<br /><br />DW to me is about gathering with friends and slipping directly into the action, smoothing over the speedbumps that might slow down play, and watching my friends be heroes.  Introducing a mechanic that encourages new systems to track gear and rewards cramped writing doesn&#39;t address any concerns i&#39;ve had with DW.</p>

        <p><i>Reason and fiction will keep people from packing halberds and ten foot poles in a satchel.</i><br /><br />You&#39;re trying to mix fictional and mechanical systems in ways that aren&#39;t really compatible. I think you&#39;ll have to pick one or the other.</p>

        <p>I was thinking more of world of Dungeons than dungeon world (same community here right?) where there are specific items, weapons, tools and treasures to carry.  Should have mentioned that first.</p>

        <p>This method worked for Mouse Guard 1e; no reason it wouldn&#39;t work here!</p>
