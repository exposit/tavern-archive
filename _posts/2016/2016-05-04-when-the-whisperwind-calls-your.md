When the Whisperwind calls your name, and tells you vicious truths of a better time, tell the group something that happened you nearby, before the War.<br /><br />Then, roll + WIS. On a 10+, nothing. On a 7-9, gain 1 Melancholy. On a 6- gain 3 Melancholy. While you have Melancholy, you have - 1 ongoing to Defy Danger and Defend. You can get rid of 1 Melancholy whenever one of these happens:<br /><br />* You foolishly put yourself in danger.<br />* You take damage from an enemy.<br />* You confess a fear or a dark desire to a friend. They have to Defy Danger +CHA not to succumb to grief or distrust.

        <p>Neat. On the last bullet, though, I wouldn&#39;t make the friend roll Defy Danger.  That&#39;s going to lead to weird results, especially on a 7-9.

Maybe with &quot;without them rejecting you for it&quot; if you want to make it even a more vulnerable moment.</p>
