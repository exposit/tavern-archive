Ever need to whip up a steading quickly on the fly?  I built a Dungeon World Steading generator.  It&#39;s even open to the community members adding new content, so we can get new and surprising features or problems for our steadings :)<br /><br /><a href="http://www.dmmuse.com/DWSteading.aspx" class="ot-anchor">http://www.dmmuse.com/DWSteading.aspx</a><br />

        <p>Yeah, that&#39;s gold. If people start lobbing in all sorts of stuff, I would like there to be an undoctored version maintained somewhere. :)</p>

        <p>I was considering adding an option to include only the &quot;book&quot; results, will probably do that soon.</p>

        <p>I agree with <span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink" href="https://plus.google.com/101025241405784788544" oid="101025241405784788544">Michael Prescott</a></span>, BTW. I am skeptical of others&#39; abilities to stay true to the DW sensibility and produce quality stuff.</p>

        <p>I think the community is up to the task!  But I do review any new entries before allowing them in, so the content is curated.</p>

        <p>For me it&#39;s not whether the community puts in good stuff, but it&#39;s a question of relative emphasis. If the probability for each option is equal, but someone contributes thirty Needs with a particular, exotic flavor to them, then the old classics are mostly displaced.</p>

        <p>The exotic flavors are driven off a sub-table, so we can get the variety while still only requiring one option in the main table.  But I understand your concern and won&#39;t let that happen.</p>

        <p>Oh, this is great! I do think a RAW version would be great, but I really like the angle of getting ideas from the community at large.</p>

        <p>Once we have some third party content added I will add the switch to include only &quot;book&quot; content.  I should also mention, if you want to add any content, but don&#39;t feel like learning how to do it on the site itself, feel free to post ideas here and I can add them to the generator.</p>
