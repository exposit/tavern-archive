A Dybbuk will &quot;kill&quot; a victim and then inhabit that body until driven out by death, spell or ritual.A Heal spell will be required to restore that person&#39;s personality.

The yellow musk creeper&#39;s method of procreation is singularly frightfulâ€”it slays the living, infests them with its seeds and pollen, then animates them as zombies. These zombies serve the plant as a guardian, but when new zombies are created, older ones wander off, collapsing and breaking apart to give seed to a new yellow musk creeper.<br /><br />Custom Move: When you inhale yellow musk pollen, ROLL+WIS.<br />On a 10+, you keep control.<br />On a 7-9, choose 1:<br />You&#39;re not dizzy for hours.(-1 on all rolls until you next make camp)<br />You don&#39;t have to Defy danger vs. WIS to attack the musk.<br />You don&#39;t take your friends for musk zombies.<br />On a 6-, you&#39;re under the yellow musk charm.
