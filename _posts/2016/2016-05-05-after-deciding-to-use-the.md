After deciding to use the Perilous Wilds after all, my players and I had our first full session of play yesterday. It went well! Their was an encounter with bandits on the road through the jungle - which ended with a surprising decapitation - and a fight with some magical dragonflies, which resulted in finding their valuable - and magical - eggs. Lots of hooks for future sessions came up, which is good.<br /><br />In terms of the actual experience of play, it was good. Our Ranger was a bit peeved that his snake ended up getting shot a couple times, but in fairness, he failed a ton of roles. I could probably stand to be a bit more consistent with my moves though. We&#39;re also playing online, so making sure that people were paying attention and weren&#39;t talking over each other was a bit tough. Otherwise, it was great! Looking forward to our next session!

        <p>Ilove Perilous Wilds!  Are you using straight DW or Freebooters?</p>

        <p>Just regular Dungeon World. Freebooters doesn&#39;t really fit what we&#39;re going for.</p>
