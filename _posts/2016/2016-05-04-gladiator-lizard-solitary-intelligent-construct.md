Gladiator Lizard	(Solitary, Intelligent, Construct)<br />Claws (d10 damage 2 piercing)	16 HP,	2 armor<br />Close<br />Special Qualities: Magical Creation<br />This extremely rare creature is only found naturally on the Bleak Shore of Nehwon. Eggs of the gladiator lizard may occasionally be taken from the Bleak Shore and the hatchlings uses as guards or in zoos.Gladiator lizards appear to be of magical or alien origin. They seem never to need food or other nourishment.They are large lizardoids with huge sharp claws instead of hands. Young lizards emerge from their eggs fully grown and the eggs can be enchanted to hatch when disturbed by intruders. Their lifespan seems to be considerable â€“ two decades or more. This is especially useful when they are used as guardians, since they cannot be tamed or otherwise civilized. In such cases, there is always a fail-safe device that can cage or otherwise restrain the gladiator lizards if the owner wishes to visit his valuables.<br />Instinct: Destroy<br />Hatch and Attack
