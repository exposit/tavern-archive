I&#39;ve been looking for a group to play (and someone else to GM) a campaign somewhat like Funnel World, only using the Villager class by Peter Johansen. Right now i&#39;m just putting out feelers as to who might be interested, but if anyone&#39;s looking for a rough estimate for time i was thinking sometime next week- After that i&#39;m gone for a week and then i&#39;ve got summer classes.
