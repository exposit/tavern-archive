Real life has gotten in the way of some products we have underway but should be out in a week or two.<br /><b>The Investigator</b> is almost done, I have to finish some interior art and that&#39;s it.<br /><b>The Krassis</b> a classed created by <span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink" href="https://plus.google.com/102532126904257134510" oid="102532126904257134510">Mark Weis</a></span>  is already done. All that is left to do is make the cover<br /><b>The Battle Dancer</b>  will be a class heavily influenced by capoeira and other cultures who have used dancing as part of combat. The class is still in its diapers.<br /><b>Fey World</b> A compilation of races, classes, steadings, monsters, and lore to run a DW game in the world of the fey. I was thinking of releasing the race and classes as a playbook and the rest as another book. What would you guys prefer? <a rel="nofollow" class="ot-hashtag" href="https://plus.google.com/s/%23dungeonworld/posts">#dungeonworld</a>

        <p>I think everything in one book makes sense.  If someone wants to play a fey-centric game, they only have to buy the one book.  If someone wants a smattering of fey in a more traditional DW game (such as just wanting the playbooks), well, it&#39;s not uncommon to pick up a larger book to get just a piece of it you&#39;re interested in.</p>
