Greetings My Google+ Brothers and Sisters!<br /><br />Just letting you all know that the Dungeon World Subreddit has been having some creative contribution threads as of late.<br /><br />If you feel like adding something to one, you get entered into the random draw to win a DW-related book.

        <p>Community Mods, if you feel it&#39;s appropriate can I get this post stickied? I&#39;m not a native G+ user so I&#39;m not sure if that&#39;s a thing here.</p>
