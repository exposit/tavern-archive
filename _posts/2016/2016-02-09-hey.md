Hey! I&#39;m looking to make an &#39;invention&#39; move, similar to the Wizard Ritual move. Here&#39;s a rough first idea I have. Any advice?<br /><br />Tinker<br />When you go to build something never seen before, tell the GM what you are trying to invent and what it does. The GM will give you one or more of the following conditions and costs:<br />*It requires considerable study<br />*You need someone else&#39;s expertise to see it to completion<br />*The components are rare and hard to come by<br />*The components are expensive<br />*It will take a very long time.<br />*It will require continuous experimentation.¬†

        <p>I host a Campaign on Roll20 Called &quot;Ghoul World&quot; It is a Dungeon World Fueled Horror Rpg; of a Post Apocalyse set in the 21st century; except advanced machinery is not invited yet like machine guns and Planes; but we do possess Steam Punk vehicles and Some Basic Older Model Guns. As for the Invent thing; I use the Official dungeon World format for my Sheet. You can tweak out some minor things and easily adapt it to your games.<br />¬†<a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/a2sr3samh35bgka/Ghoul%20World-%20Waste%20Engineer.pdf?dl=0" class="ot-anchor">https://www.dropbox.com/s/a2sr3samh35bgka/Ghoul%20World-%20Waste%20Engineer.pdf?dl=0</a><br />It will bring you to the class I created.¬†</p>

Definitely a move for large, long-term projects as most of those choices make it impossible to do anything immediately. If that&#39;s what you want, then it looks good!</p>

        <p>I think it looks fine. It&#39;s obviously inspired by the Wizard&#39;s <b>Ritual</b> move, which is not a bad thing by any means, as you mentioned it being similar. The time required is not an issue for me, as the trigger is &quot;when you build something never seen before&quot;.</p>

        <p>Yeah, apocalypse world already has this. The wizards ritual is based on an invention rule from AW.</p>

        <p>I appropriated the workshop move from AW way back when for my Artificer class. It works great! Full of story hooksüòä</p>

        <p>You could add entries for the GM to place restrictions or side effects for the invention.</p>

        <p>Choose which of the following your workspace includes. Choose 3: a garage, a darkroom, <br />a controlled growing environment, skilled labor (Carna, ÓÄÇuy, Pamming, eg), a junkyard <br />of raw materials, a truck or van, weird-ass electronica, machining tools, transmitters &amp; <br />receivers, a proving range, a relic of the golden age past, booby traps.<br />When you go into your workspace and dedicate yourself to making a thing, or to getting <br />to the bottom of some shit, decide what and tell the MC. ÓÄÇe MC will tell you ‚Äúsure, no <br />problem, but‚Ä¶‚Äù and then 1 to 4 of the following:<br />‚Ä¢ it‚Äôs going to take hours/days/weeks/months of work;<br />‚Ä¢ ÔøΩrst you‚Äôll have to get/build/ÔøΩx/ÔøΩgure out ‚Äî‚Äî;<br />‚Ä¢ you‚Äôre going to need ‚Äî‚Äî to help you with it;<br />‚Ä¢ it‚Äôs going to cost you a fuckton of jingle;<br />‚Ä¢ the best you‚Äôll be able to do is a crap version, weak and unreliable;<br />‚Ä¢ it‚Äôs going to mean exposing yourself (plus colleagues) to serious danger;<br />‚Ä¢ you‚Äôre going to have to add ‚Äî‚Äî to your workplace ÔøΩrst;<br />‚Ä¢ it‚Äôs going to take several/dozens/hundreds of tries;<br />‚Ä¢ you‚Äôre going to have to take ‚Äî‚Äî apart to do it.<br />ÓÄÇe MC might connect them all with ‚Äúand,‚Äù or might throw in a merciful ‚Äúor.‚Äù<br />Once you‚Äôve accomplished the necessaries, you can go ahead and accomplish the thing <br />itself. ÓÄÇe MC will stat it up, or spill, or whatever it calls for.</p>
