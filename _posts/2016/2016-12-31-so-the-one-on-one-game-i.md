So the one-on-one game I have going with my son got a little play time last night.<br /><br />His band (he plays a Wizard, and has a couple hirelings with him) was in a forest, and came to a raging river where I&#39;d placed a rope bridge. His character has a -1 to DEX, so he decided rather than trying to cross the bridge he wanted to spout lore about this area, pulling Clark Lewis&#39;s Journal &quot;A Journey through Darkwood&quot; (which I thought was pure awesome-sauce since he&#39;d learned about Lewis and Clark earlier this year at school) from his Bag of Books and rolling a 7, + 2 (INT) + 1 (for the book) = 10. I told him that not too far upriver, through some thick undergrowth, there was a spot of maybe 25 yards or so where the river actually went underground.  Of course he went that way.<br /><br />It&#39;s interesting to note that if he&#39;d used DEX to Defy Danger his mod roll would have been 6 and we would have fallen into the river and lost some goodies!<br /><br />I feel it&#39;s SO important to remember to &quot;Play to find out what happens&quot; because I (unfairly) assumed he&#39;d just go with what I gave him (DD with DEX) rather than finding a better solution.

        <p>He&#39;s 14 and amazes me sometimes with how smart he is, especially for someone who doesn&#39;t read much outside of school and spends a lot of time playing video games!<br /><br />I asked him why Celebrimbor (his Elf Wizard) would have that particular book in his bag, and his answer was &quot;He figured he&#39;d probably be travelling through Darkwood so he grabbed it off the bookshelf. Unlike me, he reads a LOT dad&quot;.<br /><br />I&#39;m always amazed at how easily he differentiates his character from himself!</p>

        <p>He loves learning, but doesn&#39;t really like to read. It&#39;s strange!<br /><br />He came home from school one day and said &quot;Mr. so-and-so is having us read Magic Kingdom Sold or something and it&#39;s like this fantasy book that I think you&#39;d like&quot;. I replied &quot;Magic Kingdom for Sale - Sold by Terry Brooks. Cool book, how far are you?&quot; and he just laughed and said &quot;Well of course you&#39;ve read that!&quot;</p>

        <p>Never though of playing one-on-one with my kiddo. He&#39;s 15. He&#39;d probably like it, and it&#39;d be a great way for us to spend some time together!</p>

        <p>Now, my son would MUCH rather be playing video games (he&#39;s really into Battlefield 1 right now) but he saw me finishing up a campaign with some friends and thought it looked interesting enough to try. We only play for a couple hours at a time before he has the itch for his PS4 controller.</p>

        <p>These are the moments in gaming that I cherish. The roads less traveled.</p>
