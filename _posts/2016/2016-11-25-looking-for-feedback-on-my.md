Looking for feedback on my compendium class idea.  Thinking of sending this in for the Discern Realities Podcast contest. Any thoughts or suggestions?  <br /><br />Saprotroph<br /><br />When you become infected by a powerful fungus and choose to enter into a symbiotic relationship with it, you can take this compendium class.<br /><br />Spurt Ergotic Spores<br />When you spurt your ergotic spores, describe the hallucination and desired mind altering effect on those that would inhale them. Then roll + CON.<br /><br />On a 10+ the hallucination and effect occur as desired. You cannot spurt ergotic spores again until you fill your ergotic spore sacs.<br /><br />On a 7-9, the same as 10+, but choose one: <br />- You draw unwanted attention or put yourself in a spot.<br />- You get a less powerful effect and/or duration than desired.<br />- You affect an unintended target (or targets) as well.<br />The GM will tell you how.<br /><br />Excrete Enzymes <br />When you take time to excrete your enzymes into dead organic matter and absorb nutrition from it, roll + CON. On a 10+ choose two, on a 7-9 choose one. <br />- Learn a useful bit of knowledge about the organic matter, or something it knew when it was alive. The GM will tell you what.<br />- Heal 1d8 damage. <br />- Consume a ration.<br />- Fill your ergotic spore sacs.<br />If performed while making camp do not roll and choose two.<br /><br />Weave Mycellium<br />When you connect your hyphae to the fungal network running throughout the area, roll + CON. On a 10+ the GM will tell you something interesting and useful about one of the following, your choice.<br />- The shape and contours of the area <br />- The flora and fauna that inhabit it  <br />On a 7-9, still choose, but the GM will only tell you something interesting. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

        <p>Are those all separate moves that the player only choose one of each time they level up? Because if so, it seems rather unfair to have a move that depletes the spore sacs and another that refills them.</p>

        <p>All of the moves use CON rolls... Not sure if this is a good thing or a bad thing, but if I had to pick one to change I would consider making Weave Mycellium use WIS.</p>
