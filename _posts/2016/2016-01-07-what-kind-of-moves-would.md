What kind of moves would you give a playbook all about being the last of your (exceptional) kind, and all the emotions that comes with?

        <p>Some sort of backstory-generating move, maybe similar to the barbarian&#39;s Outsider.</p>

        <p>The first thing that came to my mind is the Survivor from Inverse World.</p>

        <p>yeah, actually, im trying to make it distinct from the survivor, and I will admit, I am mostly doing this for the fun of class design. I have a base move, three origins, and a couple advanced moves thus far</p>

        <p>How did you come to be the last of your kind?  The reason you are left would cause a host of different emotions and would demand different responses.  Was it an external force, a natural cause, were you responsible? Are you angry, guilty, afraid, proud?</p>

You still remember vividly the powers of your race.

Take an extra option for Last Of My Kind.<br /><br />Destroyer                                          Race stat: STR<br />You destroyed them yourself. Maybe they were horribly corrupted, and you had no choice. Or maybe you went mad, and now have to live with the regret. Now, any destruction seems petty to you, your damage die is a D10, and all your attacks have the Messy tag.</p>

        <p>You need a loneliness move.  It could be a thing like Outsider where you get a class resource for narrating backstory (I wouldn&#39;t go with it granting xp, because part of the reason Barbarians have extra xp moves is that their Herculean Appetites move reduces the number of failures they roll and hence xp gained by normal means).  <br /><br />I suspect that you need to focus your vision on what kind of Kind you&#39;re the Last Of to get good advanced moves.  Like, the Martian Manhunter has a very different set than does Y, The Last Man.  (The Origin moves you&#39;ve sketched are very powerful, much more so than the ones for the book classes.  That&#39;s not necessarily a problem, as long as you know what you&#39;re balancing against.)</p>

The result determines whether they get to ask the GM questions about the apocolypse, or whether they have to answer the GM&#39;s questions, or one of each (I think). Comes with a list of cool, evocative questions to ask, too. It&#39;s a really cool dynamic, and sort of forces a flashback at the beginning of each session.<br /><br />You might try something like that.</p>

        <p>two caveats <br />1. I know this is a powerhouse, im trying to nerf it<br />2.

        <p>That&#39;s really cool.  Promising.  How about something like this:<br /><b>Been Here Before</b><br />When you enter a new place, describe one thing you remember that used to be here, and one thing that&#39;s obviously changed.</p>
