I use Roll20 for the mapping and character sheets, but the video chat there isn&#39;t that good, so my group uses Hangouts.<br /><br />New-style Hangouts seems to improve overall video quality for everyone, so we have taken to rolling dice in Roll20 as well. This is not as good as Dicestream, but whatever.<br /><br />The feature I miss the most is the ability to slap text on the video to know a character&#39;s names or other tidbits. What do you people do for this?

        <p>Sub. My entire group has to swap back to Old Hangouts because New just drops too much functionality we need.</p>
