Hi,<br /><br />I&#39;m looking for some advice on playing Dungeon World with 2 players + GM.<br /><br />I&#39;ve tried it once, and found that the inter-player character relationships fell flat.<br /><br />Thanks!

        <p>It&#39;s hard for me to offer advice here without more details. What do you feel was lacking? Did the players feel the same way?</p>

        <p>Specifically, it was weird and really, really artificial that they always had to name each other in their Rxs.</p>

        <p>Bonds say &quot;fill in at least one with the name of a companion&quot;. It doesn&#39;t specify that it has to be another PC. Those could be filled in with the names of NPCs if the players wanted. You also don&#39;t have to fill in all of them.</p>

        <p>Really just play with less focus on the relationships, as DM I&#39;d &quot;play&quot; a party member in this case as triangles in relationships and networks work better. <span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink" href="https://plus.google.com/108053817066303198241" oid="108053817066303198241">Chris Stone-Bush</a></span> noted that it says companion and not PC which is the way of making it more flexible at run-time.</p>

        <p>I&#39;m currently running a game with 6 players and the interplayer relations are flat at times. I think it all depends on the players themselves and the tone and focus set by the gm.  The bond system is something I&#39;ve been wanting to hack but haven&#39;t come up with anything worth while yet.</p>

        <p>Hey, I totally missed that &quot;companion&quot; nuance; I translated that to &quot;Player Character&quot; without even realizing.  Very cool.</p>
