Hello! <br /><br />How common is it to create custom moves during play? For example, a PC wants to impress the king by reciting an epic poem, there is no danger to defy, and no real leverage for parley, so a move doesn&#39;t get triggered. I could use a GM move but I suppose I could also come up with a custom player move on the spot. Which would you do and why?<br /><br />Thank you!

        <p>I probably use 1-3 custom moves per session, a lot of them improvised, though</p>

        <p>Short answer: Personally I prefer to make custom moves when I have downtime so I can really think about them. But sometimes you have to make them up on the spot, and that&#39;s totally fine.<br /><br />Regarding your example though, if there is no danger to defy, no leverage to parley, and no other move gets triggered, then I would say the thing just happens.  Honestly though, I think you&#39;re missing an opportunity here. If a character is attempting to impress the king by reciting an epic poem, I would say there <i>IS</i> danger, as the character might bungle the recital.<br /><br />If there&#39;s no chance of failure, or nothing is being risked by doing something, it just happens.</p>

        <p>That&#39;s also a golden opportunity for the GM. The players are looking to you to find out what happens next.</p>

        <p>I agree with <span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink" href="https://plus.google.com/108053817066303198241" oid="108053817066303198241">Chris Stone-Bush</a></span>​ after further thought. There <b>is</b> danger here - failure means he&#39;s unimpressed or maybe even insulted!</p>

        <p>Along with <span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink" href="https://plus.google.com/108053817066303198241" oid="108053817066303198241">Chris Stone-Bush</a></span> &#39;s suggestion, the court itself could be the danger in the epic poem recital. Perhaps the court is one of those places where offense is easily taken. Or perhaps the courtiers spend a lot of time attempting veiled insults. There is this movie called Ridicule about 18th century Versailles, and one character is this amazing orator. He makes the mistake, however, of saying, &quot;Now, for your amusement, I will disprove the existence of God&quot; and he immediately gets imprisoned by the king, who despite being decadent, considers himself pious.</p>

        <p>I generally find that custom moves I make during play are <i>basically</i> Defy Danger with the possible 7-9 results pre-established before rolling.  Generally.  <br /><br />Like <span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink" href="https://plus.google.com/108053817066303198241" oid="108053817066303198241">Chris Stone-Bush</a></span>, I like to come up with the unexpected ones between sessions.<br /><br />But I also find that the more you play, the more you get a feel for it, the more you can riff on older moves that you want.  <br /><br />For example, a few custom moves I&#39;ve written between play have involved magic that produces strong emotions, and now I know that a good way to handle those is 10+ you feel a little X for a bit but shake it off; 7-9 describe a time you felt X and take <del>1 forward; 6</del> as a 7-9 but you&#39;re overcome and reeling until something snaps you out of it.    I can tweak that in play to handle similar situations pretty easily.  </p>

        <p>I also found that many of the moves I came up with on the fly were basically <b>Defy Danger</b> with very specific outcomes, as <span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink" href="https://plus.google.com/102595580176380683252" oid="102595580176380683252">Jeremy Strandberg</a></span> said.

        <p>They&#39;re something to be said for a perception of danger, too. If there&#39;s no pressure, why is it a question? Say it gets done. If someone fears a bad result, that&#39;s Defy Danger, even if the king laughs off a bad recitation, or decides a botched display demands a quest somewhere to regain Honor.</p>

        <p>When you perform in front of the King&#39;s court, roll + Cha. On a 10+, hold 3. On a 7-9, hold 1. You can spend your holds to:<br />- Ask for a small favor, shelter or help from one of the nobles.<br />- You get some piece of information about coutly intrigue and gossip.<br />- You get +1 foward when trying to seduce them.<br /><br />On a 6- you babble or underperform in some way. The GM will tell you what happened.</p>

        <p>I would let the player roleplay whatever he wants to do to impress the king and after the amazement of the king or rejection of the performance I would give him a +1 or -1 forward to next Parley with the king or his courtiers. It&#39;s a roleplaying game nevertheless. That&#39;s what I&#39;d do. </p>

Let the players talk out their thrusts and slashes and then adjudicate the narration at the end. /s<br /><br />Rules and rolls and risking things makes these situations exciting. There&#39;s a reason a lot of people play combat heavy games - because it&#39;s the tense part of a lot of roleplaying systems. And unless there is a way to share narration, or take the decision of the outcome out of the GM&#39;s hands, its going to violate the Czege Principle (when one person decides both the challenge <b>and</b> outcome, it&#39;s boring)</p>

        <p>These are all great responses! Thank you! <br /><br />One thing I&#39;m trying to understand is how useful custom moves are during play. Are they a crutch?  Should I just be using the GM moves and player moves? Or is it a technique that is commonly used. I trying to get a sense of best practice.</p>

        <p>Eh, it&#39;s not about &quot;best practice&quot; or whether you &quot;should&quot; be doing anything.  Custom moves are just a tool in your toolbox.  The skill is in recognizing what value they add and when they&#39;re useful.<br /><br />For custom moves that are basically just pre-scripted Defy Danger, the main value is in communicating expectations. It makes the risk/reward calculations more obvious to the players.  It&#39;s really just an application of the GM move <b>tell them the consequences &amp; requirements and ask</b>.  <br /><br />The other value these have is that they can make life easier during the game. If you have a Defy Danger-esque move written up in advance (or can just riff one from something you&#39;ve done earlier), that&#39;s one less bit of cognitive load you&#39;re dealing with in-session as the GM.  If you struggle with coming up with good 7-9 results on Defy Danger on-the-fly, then you might find a lot of value in pre-scripting them.<br /><br />Custom moves that do more mechanically interesting stuff (like hold-and-spend moves or question-asking, or even-on-a-10+-you-gotta-choose-something-bad moves), are <i>also</i> good for setting expectations.  But they&#39;ve got the added benefit of doing some world-building for you.<br /><br />Like, if you have a custom move that says &quot;when you let the Gem&#39;s power course through, roll CON and hold 3 (10+) or 1 (7-9), and spend them to a) volley with a blast of lighting, b) zap yourself instantaneously to another place you can see, or c) keep access to a spell when you would otherwise lose it... well, that sort of move tells you a lot about what the Gem is and does, the nature of it&#39;s magic, and the what is possible with magic in your game world. <br /><br />Another benefit for that sort of move is that it gives the players something fun to play with.  If you&#39;ve got players that like a little more crunch, a little more resource management, etc., then these sorts of moves go a long way.  <br />Final thought (I could probably go on for days): if you actually present the moves to the player (or at least their triggers) in a &quot;formal&quot; way (like on an index card or posted to a group chat), you&#39;re basically <i>daring</i> the players to make that move.  You&#39;re saying &quot;hey, if you do this, something interesting will happen.&quot;  And that&#39;s valuable by itself.</p>
