I&#39;ve tried DW once before with my oldest (19) and his friend (19) and my other two kids (15 and 14). We role played for an hour after setting up characters for 45 minutes; we used the &quot;demo game&quot; the Slave Pits of Drazhu. We haven&#39;t been able to all get back together to finish, but my kiddo&#39;s been asking for more.  <br /><br />So tonight it was for all new players (13 and 14 year old friends of my youngest). The two with prior RPG/D&amp;D experience said it was really fun and different, and the other two have never done anything like this before and were swept into the story. They&#39;re all asking when our next meeting is. :) <br /><br />Not sure if we did everything &quot;right&quot; or &quot;by the book,&quot; but they&#39;re having fun and want more... It&#39;s a start!

        <p>If everyone had fun and wanted more, then you did it right.</p>
