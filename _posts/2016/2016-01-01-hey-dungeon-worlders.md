        <p>Norbert is such a cool name! Yeah, I have heavily modded DW to fit the tone I like for my next KS project. Among many things, I changed Spout Lore to &#39;Recall Lore&#39; and Discern Realities to &#39;Investigate.&#39; I&#39;ve also built a sort of collectible move set that can interchange between classes to build hybrids as character learn and grow. Stay tuned! More to come!</p>

        <p>That sounds great! A lot of the terms in DW are wack :D</p>

        <p>heheh...I just find a few of them to feel sort of sarcastic or perjorative.. Spouting isn&#39;t a thing I want to do :p For a lot of groups I&#39;m sure it&#39;s totally groovy...to each their own!</p>
