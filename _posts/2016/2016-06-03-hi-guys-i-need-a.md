Hi guys, <br /><br />I need a bit of your help this time :)<br /><br />I cannot see the difference between the move <b>Tricks of the Trade</b> - basic move from rogue playbook when disabling traps, and any other character try to do so by defying danger (DEX roll) .<br /><br />In both on 10+ they get it. On 7-9 they still do it, but the GM<br />does a minor move. <br /><br />Ok, you can decide to don&#39;t let others but rogues roll for it, but I don&#39;t like it that way to be honest since it might happen that silly situation in which the group goes into a dungeons, the rogue dies and the rest...well would they be doomed in the dark? <br /><br />Thx in advance :)

        <p>Tricks of the Trade is not <i>much</i> better than standard Defy Danger, but it is better.<br /><br />On a 7-9 Defy Danger, the GM can offer &quot;a worse outcome, a hard bargain, or an ugly choice.&quot;  That gives the GM a lot of leeway in just how hard of a move to make on that 7-9 result.<br /><br />On a 7-9 Tricks of the Trade, &quot;the GM will offer you two options between suspicion, danger, or cost.&quot; That means the GM is <i>always</i> giving the Thief a choice on a 7-9, and the Thief&#39;s player can pick their poison.<br /><br />What&#39;s probably more important is that the move explicitly means that picking locks, picking pockets, and disabling traps is something the thief can <i>do</i>.  <br /><br />When another PC wants to do those things, they aren&#39;t necessarily triggering a move, they are looking to the GM to see what happens.  That means it&#39;s time for the GM to make a GM move.  And, yeah, maybe it&#39;s &quot;okay, sure, but you&#39;ll be defying danger and the best you can hope for is ...&quot; (<b>tell them the requirements/consequences &amp; ask</b>).  But they might also choose a move of <b>make them backtrack</b> or <b>give an opportunity fitting a class&#39;s abilities</b>.  &quot;Yeah, picking a lock isn&#39;t something just anyone can do. Too bad you don&#39;t have a trained thief, or a fighter who can bash this door down.  You&#39;ll need to think of another way to bypass the door or take another route. What do you do?&quot;</p>

        <p>It&#39;s more of a permission move in my book, like <span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink" href="https://plus.google.com/102595580176380683252" oid="102595580176380683252">Jeremy Strandberg</a></span> said.<br /></p>

        <p>Also, I think common practice is usually, if the party doesn&#39;t have a thief, then normally a GM won&#39;t put traps in a dungeon. I would make exceptions on 6- rolls while in a dungeon to be able to make an interesting move, but thats always a trap they had no knowledge of. I always get hung up on when to put traps in when the thief is present. I hate saying, &quot;Well maybe you should roll to see if there are any traps in here.&quot; but its better than telling them they should just roll at every new room. That is tedious!</p>

Everything from a feeling to his/her eye catching something minute works. They&#39;re a trained professional after all, right? Makes sense they would naturally spot clues like that that others would miss. Also, with or without a thief warning of traps before they even get there (not blatantly, but in the fiction) helps them to prepare properly as well (research, hire a hireling, the bolster special move, etc.).</p>

I also don&#39;t avoid undead because they don&#39;t have a cleric.</p>

If they&#39;re in a place that could very well have those things, I still include them, but the party doesn&#39;t have someone specifically skilled to handle it, so I use traps as hard moves instead of the thief being clued in on their presence with a soft move. I guess I wasn&#39;t clear before. Sorry!</p>
