It&#39;s been awhile.  Here, have some more artifacts (major arcana) for <a rel="nofollow" class="ot-hashtag" href="https://plus.google.com/s/%23Stonetop/posts">#Stonetop</a>.<br /><br />This time, the <b>Staff of the Lidless Eye</b> and the <b>Twisted Spear</b>.  (The Twisted Spear needs a better picture, but that&#39;s sort of gets the idea across.)<br /><br />As always, feedback appreciated!<br />

        <p>Love the feel of these, and the campaign in general.</p>

        <p>I love stonetop. It has an awesome bronze age, low magic feeling.</p>

        <p>When the Lidless Orb steals someone&#39;s sight, do they become blind?<br /><br />If I&#39;m counting tasks right, you can only ever get three of the four powers of the Twisted Spear.  Intended?<br /><br />The consequences of the Twisted Spear are awesome.  The consequences of the Lidless Orb — I&#39;d want to be sure the player had some idea what they were in for before they became too attached to the item.  The initial power doesn&#39;t seem particularly ominous, although the illustration does.</p>

        <p>I could build an entire campaign out of just one of these. Great work.</p>

That&#39;s my intent, yes.  <br /><br /><i>only ever get three of four powers of the Twisted Spear</i>.  Yep, intentional.<br /><br /><i>I&#39;d want to be sure the player had some idea what they were in for</i>.  The intent of these is that the player gets the card outright. I&#39;d probably tell them not to look closely at the back until they unlocked it&#39;s secrets, but once they do, they can see all the potential moves and consequences.<br /><br />So with the Staff, yeah... I&#39;d expect there to be some tension between &quot;holy crap these effects are potent and I want to use them!&quot; and &quot;oh gawd, those consequences are... awful.&quot;</p>

        <p>Having to suffer a consequence on a 7–9 is ... rough.</p>
