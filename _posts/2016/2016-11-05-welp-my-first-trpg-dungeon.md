Welp, my first TRPG (Dungeon World) campaign as a player has come to a close tonight, after about 8 months, with, (as I suspect is not actually all that uncommon) one of the players, a Grim World Necromancer eating the brain of the Prime God to become one himself, but losing his own mind in the process. <br /><br />It was a wild ride; by the second session, I was obsessed with inhabiting my player and seeing the world from their eyes, trying to figure out what they&#39;d do in the tight situation they were in (at that point, separated from one PC, deep in a giant centipede infested underground bunker-temple, the body of the other PC dead at their feet having been mostly responsible for his death). <br /><br />The world itself was oppressive and relentless, but I kept coming back for more, wanting to uncover its secrets (this campaign was more pre-prepped sandbox style than Vanilla DW). My second and last character being a paladin felt like a relief; I mostly needed to only care about fulfilling my chosen gods&#39; will. In the end, he was forsaken due to his own companion&#39;s ambition.<br /><br />It&#39;s definitely time for some more light-hearted games for a while, whew.
