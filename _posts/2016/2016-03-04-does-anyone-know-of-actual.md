Does anyone know of actual play videos of DW being played at a physical tabletop?<br /><br />I am trying to convince my group to give DW a chance, as I need a break from Pathfinder. One of our members (also our primary [and most talented] GM) doesn&#39;t like the Roll20 AP video I sent (Adam Koebel and Austin Walker... what more is there to want?),  as he thinks AP recordings online lack a certain je ne sais quoi.<br /><br />So, to reiterate, does anyone know of actual play videos of DW being played at a physical tabletop? Hopefully also with a fun cast and a good grip on the rules.<br /><br />EDIT: Podcast episodes recorded at a physical table might also be acceptable

        <p>Would you be the GM for this DW game? Or are you trying to convince your current DM to switch? If the latter, you are in for an impossible task. <br /><br />Be the change! Run a one shot.</p>

        <p>Yeah, I am planning on running the game, this is just to get a couple squeaky wheels onboard</p>

        <p>Run it without the squeaky wheel and let the rest of your group&#39;s unbridled glee win them over. If you really need to get them at the table for the first session, go for the throat and get them to read 16 Hit Point Dragon. <a href="http://www.latorra.org/2012/05/15/a-16-hp-dragon/" class="ot-anchor">http://www.latorra.org/2012/05/15/a-16-hp-dragon/</a></p>

        <p>No video but our podcast is just us putting a recorder in the middle of the table.  I edit out the bathroom breaks and out of game chatter about real life but other than that it is just us running our monthly game.

        <p>Knights of the Night had an actual play podcast for Dungeon World - found it when I was looking for actual plays of the system before I dove in as GM.</p>

        <p>I&#39;m with everyone else here who says &quot;just run it&quot;. If some people don&#39;t want to play, that&#39;s fine. They don&#39;t have to play. Have a blast with the people who <i>do</i> want to play, or are at least willing to see what the game is like.</p>

        <p>Here&#39;s one I find of dawnforgescast running at a physical table: <a href="https://youtu.be/ZYwFMQW5N2Y" class="ot-anchor">https://youtu.be/ZYwFMQW5N2Y</a><br /><br />I haven&#39;t gone completely thorough it so I can&#39;t vouch for the quality of the session.</p>

        <p>The Walking Eye AP is an audio-only recording of tabletop play; I&#39;m working through the 4-ish sessions right now: <a href="http://www.thewalkingeye.com/?p=2135" class="ot-anchor">http://www.thewalkingeye.com/?p=2135</a><br /><br />But the best that I&#39;ve found is Friends at the Table, GM&#39;d by the aforementioned Austin Walker. Yes, they play over Skype but the play is awesome without feeling contrived. Start at the beginning and enjoy the ride: <a href="http://friendsatthetable.net/e/dungeon-world-actual-play-00-were-not-calling-it-duckberg/" class="ot-anchor">http://friendsatthetable.net/e/dungeon-world-actual-play-00-were-not-calling-it-duckberg/</a></p>

        <p>Just like apocalypse world playthroughs I have yet to find an amazing tabletop video. It&#39;s one of those things that sucks you in when you sit at the table and begin forming the world and relationships. Just gonna have to order some pizza, sit down and say this is what we are doing tonight. Worse to worse it doesn&#39;t pan out and you go back next week. Although I bet it will be fine.</p>

        <p>One Shot Podcast does Dungeon World sometimes, maybe not the best example to demonstrate the system, but if you&#39;re trolling for AP, they&#39;re definitely my favorite <a href="http://www.oneshotpodcast.com/" class="ot-anchor">http://www.oneshotpodcast.com/</a></p>
