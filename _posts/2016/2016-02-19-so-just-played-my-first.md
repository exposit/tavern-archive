So Just played my first Dungeon World game in awhile, we were going to use Perilous Wilds to create the world but first an opening scene We start with a wizards tower, the players having delivered a really nice old Paladin that volunteers at Soup kitchens called Arcadius.<br /><br />But dun dun dun the Wizard actually was going to use Arcadius saintly energy for nefarious means, the monk decided that he was going to run down the tower, but instead he ran down the tower about to hit the ground. The Executioner tried to save him but it was a monumental weight and he found himself hanging by his feet trying to hold on. The Wizard seeing this grabbed onto Arcadius and tried to put him into a cage. The Bard trying to convince the Wizard not to do this failed and a battle was about to happen. But at this point the executioner got up and stabbed the Wizard in the chest.<br /><br />The Wizard Tower then started to crumble around them, the players tried to get out. The Druid Minotaur was able to change into a flying squirrel and said by to everyone. Fun was had with grappling hooks by the Cleric and Executioner. And the rest decided to use the stairs. While on the stairs the Bard decided to figure out if she knew anything about what was happening, turned out she did and that they were actually in an ancient Planar spaceship. She decided what the heck and convinced all the players to come on board.<br /><br />So instead of a regions and cities on a fantasy map, we actually created different planes and decided what was all these planes. It was completely not what I was expecting but was damn cool and now we have so many different planes that we can explore and the players are on a ship that may need the saintly life force of people to run it.<br /><br />I can say that was a bloody good reintroduction to Dungeon World. And I&#39;m excited and terrified with the massive sweep we have created with all these planes.

        <p>Perhaps you can control the speed of the ship. I mean, it has to travel through something  (plasma, aether, flux?) to get from point A to point B. That&#39;s one device used in Sci fi rpgs. Another is this, (using the Luther Arkwright setting of runequest 6) - just because you got to this plane doesn&#39;t mean you can just leave. Ex:  You&#39;ve created paradox by your mere existence among the dinosaur men. They have evolved and man does not exist. Now you have to reset the paradigm pylons before you can leave! Just an example. I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll find a way. :)</p>

        <p>Actually thinking about it ladt night, i played a few sessions of stars and the one thing that i didn&#39;t think was that interesting was the space travel since the players are all cooped up &quot;safe&quot; and you always have to bring external threats to them.<br /><br />So I think in going to do like the planarch codex but instead of a city its basically a fantasy world in itself its just the ship is the one that creates for them. So if the ship runs out of fuel the planar sea breaks down.</p>

        <p>Good premise.  As long as it fits into the logic of your setting,  I think you&#39;ll be fine.</p>

        <p>You could also go with the Planescape approach to travel; you&#39;ve got to find a portal and you need to know it&#39;s gate key. Keys can be anything: a wine glass or flower, a gesture or musical note or even an emotion. Then part of the fiction can revolve around discovery.<br /><br /></p>
