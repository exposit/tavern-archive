Presenting the Dark Knight.<br /><br />It&#39;s gone through a few versions so far, but the original idea was to make a Final Fantasy style Dark Knight. If you can&#39;t tell, things went on a bit from there.<br /><br />I&#39;d hardly call it finished, but I&#39;m looking to sort this thing out, so I&#39;m submitting it here. Critique is appreciated, as well as replacement wording for any text you find unwieldy. Some of these things aren&#39;t easy to write well.<br /><br />Thoughts?
