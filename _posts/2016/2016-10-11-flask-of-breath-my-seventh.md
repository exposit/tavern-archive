I&#39;m going to draw monsters, weapons, and magic items from the <a rel="nofollow" class="ot-hashtag" href="https://plus.google.com/s/%23DungeonWorld/posts">#DungeonWorld</a> rulebook and from the Dungeon World Codex (<a href="http://codex.dungeon-world.com" class="ot-anchor">http://codex.dungeon-world.com</a>). <br /><br />If you like the drawings and would like to support me in Extra Life this year, you can donate to my campaign at <a href="http://www.extra-life.org/participant/jimjones" class="ot-anchor">http://www.extra-life.org/participant/jimjones</a>.<br /><br />You have my sincere appreciation if you do.<br /><br />All the money that I raise goes directly to Riley Hospital for Children in Indianapolis, Indiana. My youngest daughter, Rogue, had a life saving cranial reconstruction surgery at Riley when she was just a little over one year old. Today, she is a happy and healthy almost six year old who is thriving in kindergarten. <br /><br />Let me know what you think. <br /><br />ï»¿

My seventh #Inktober drawing is a #DungeonWorld magic item, the Flask of Breath..

I am still catching up, so I'll probably do a couple of magic items.

This one is the Flask of Breath. It holds an I exhaustible source of air. I envision it as a simple flask that is wrapped in a dull grey shark skin unto which a simple brass plate, with a number of different size holes drilled through it, is affixed.

I hope you like my attempt</a>
