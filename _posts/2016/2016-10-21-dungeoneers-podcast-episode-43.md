The flashback finishes up as the party arrives in Dyson Hallow to discover that it's not as advertised. Will the hopes and dreams of Bartimus Badger fuel our heroes to turn the town around? Or will they get future slapped to fix continuity? Starring Mike Robertson, Jeffrey Nye, Ronnie "Verge" Whitmire, Brandt "Spooky" Wetzel  and guest star Joe Young of the Adventures From the Shed podcast.   dungeoneerspodcast.com | facebook.com/dungeoneerspodca...
