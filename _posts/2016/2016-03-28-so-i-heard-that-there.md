So i heard that there was a B-baller class for dungeon world. the problem is you have to have access to the something awful forums witch costs 10$ to have. i decided to make my own b-baller class. right now i only have the first page done and the second one is coming soon. if you see any imbalance or other problems post it in the comments.

        <p>You get a lot of content for the $10. IMHO worth it.</p>
