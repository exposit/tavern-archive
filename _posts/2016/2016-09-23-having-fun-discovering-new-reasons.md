Having fun discovering new reasons why I like this system so much.  One of my players, after our kick-off session, came to me and said, &quot;I really hate to ask this, but I have to admit, I wasn&#39;t really enjoying the character I created.  Would it be possible for me to create a different character?  Hopefully that won&#39;t mess up any of your plans too much?&quot;<br /><br />I smile and respond &quot;Absolutely, do you have any ideas on how [your current character] might die?&quot;  We&#39;re about to jump into a pit with a giant dragon-like creature (well at least the Barbarian did at the end of the session, so maybe the rest will follow... :D ), so that&#39;s probably not too hard to arrange.  I reassure him that plans are not a problem; I honestly don&#39;t know what&#39;s going to happen.  &quot;Seriously, it&#39;s okay to talk about these things; we&#39;re playing a game and the system is aware of that.  It&#39;s our story and we can choose in what directions we want to push it.&quot;  And the best part is, there&#39;s really not much I need to change.  Who knows, maybe the consequences of this death (if that&#39;s even what happens) will set the direction for the entire campaign?<br /><br />One little thing I&#39;m secretly looking forward to, if he dies and succeeds on Last Breath, is to say &quot;Death is willing to give you another chance, but you can choose to die anyway; if you do, why?&quot;

        <p>Why would the character have to die? Couldn&#39;t you just begin the next session without that character in the spotlight? Like, suppose the character just had other interests or other business to take care of. Or maybe &quot;demote&quot; the character to a hireling.<br /><br />We had a player make up a new character, and the old character just disappeared. Given the circumstances of her first adventure, it didn&#39;t require any further information.<br /><br />If the player wants to continue running the old character until some pre-determined death, go ahead. I just wouldn&#39;t think it was the only option.</p>

        <p>I did suggest some other options (including just retconning it, since we&#39;ve only had the first session), but dying seemed like an interesting opportunity for story development, especially since we left off at a cliffhanger right before a likely major fight.Â  There&#39;s no guarantee he&#39;ll die (odd things have a way of happening once we start playing), though I can certainly apply pressure in that direction with GM moves.</p>

        <p>Far be it from me to encourage anyone to wimp out on killing the delvers. Sometimes that&#39;s what it means to be a fan.</p>

        <p>When the point of death comes, ie 0 hit points, instead of Last Breathe just narrate his removal from the scene: your last sight of character x is the giants carrying him way/struggling to swim as the river sweeps him around the bend and out of sight/teetering on the edge of cliff before he topples backwards into the darkness below ...<br /><br />Then, have him be revealed 10 adventures later a power behind whatever BBEG has appeared, or give him an entire new Front to show there is a new power in the gameworld. The character is either a danger for an existing front, or has a new front for themselves. <br /><br />Perhaps they think the rest of the party are just tools for forces in the city they came from are have been used to &quot;remove&quot; them and the vengeance is against the city/region and not the characters.</p>

        <p>In case anyone is curious, he actually didn&#39;t wind up dying; despite a great deal of danger directed his way, good rolls and clever play on the part of the other players meant that the character survived.  He&#39;s now been NPC-ified, with a good motive worked out for why he&#39;ll likely be parting ways soon (probably at the start of the next session.)  I&#39;m not sure if this character will show up again, but was interesting to see how it played out.</p>
