So I&#39;m a big Xena fan I watched all the episodes and the Hercules show Xena trilogy of eps.  It has really influenced my view of RPGs with its its Grecian take on sword and sorcery.  I think it really fits dungeon world with all the gods and demons and heroic and villainous characters on quests and adventures.  I would like to make a better more realistic bard class for bards like Gabrielle (I think she took many fighter moves when multiclassing). As well as some hacks and specialized moves and items.  If anyone knows of people who have already done this or similar please let me know thank you.  Xenite forever! Woo!﻿

        <p><i>Fourth World</i>, my hack of <i>Earthdawn</i> into <i>Dungeon World</i> has a Troubadour class, which is not the typical bard. I&#39;ll have to reread it thinking about Gabrielle, but it&#39;s probably not the best fit. Might lead you somewhere, though.</p>

        <p>What do you mean by &quot;better more realistic bard&quot;?</p>

        <p>Well by better I meant better for the xenaverse setting.  Many, all the abilities Gabrielle has are nonmagical and little to do with instruments (though she can sing, dance, and play pan pipes). She only does occasionally.  She relied more in her staff, her wits and telling legends and stories and lore and her people skills.  And a little mundane healing.  And good counseling.  Basically Gabrielle lives in a magical world though none of her abilities are magical.  Nor is her main ability to buff players in combat with music.  </p>

        <p>A few super quick options you can explore:<br />* Print out the fighter sheet and let your bard take moves from it as well as the bard sheet. Also let them swap any of their starting moves, bonds, and alignments with ones from the fighter sheet.<br />* Grab Johnstone Metzger&#39;s (excellent) Class Warfare supplement from DriveThruRPG, which lets you cobble together all kinds of hybrid classes.</p>

        <p>Thanks for the ideas.  I was already imagining  taking fighter stuff, but also wanted new stuff to replace the magic bard powers.  Also I&#39;m low on money  and spare virtual memory so buying stuff like class warfare or downloading it would be tricky but your ideas are good.</p>

        <p>Maybe check out the alternate Bard playbook from Awful Good Games? It&#39;s on DTRPG. <br /><br />If I recall correctly, it&#39;s a much less magicky take on the bard... more about inspiring tales and soulful performances.</p>

        <p>The drive thru bard looks good by description, but the preview is to blurry to read much and I don&#39;t have the money to buy.</p>
