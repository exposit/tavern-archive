        <p>Neat and simple, which is something I always look for when pilfering the Tavern for ideas. One thing that might be worth including is how long the weapon&#39;s transformation lasts, e.g. one move, one move per blood you spend, etc.<br /><br />I think the wording on some of the effects could be cleaned up (they&#39;re favoring brevity over clarity).<br />* Attack from short distance: Not sure this actually confers any benefit; I think most characters can always do this. Perhaps &quot;Hold your ground&quot; or even &quot;Destroy the terrain.&quot;<br />* Take weapon damage --&gt; deal double damage: I think this one could stand a few more words just to make it clearer.<br />* Split into 2: Kinda confusing what actually happens to your dice. Making it &quot;roll twice and take the higher result&quot; would be a powerful but much simpler concept.<br />* Fire pistol: Interesting for Bloodborne flavor, a bit prescriptive for DW flavor (not all settings would have pistols). If you wanted to make it more generic you could just say &quot;Add an additional range tag to your weapon.&quot;</p>
