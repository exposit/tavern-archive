I said I don&#39;t have time to work on this, and I don&#39;t, but I did anyway.<br /><br />Here&#39;s a little bit of <b>Drowning and Falling</b>, a collection of oft-applicable custom moves for Dungeon World.<br /><br />(EDIT: And alas, I now realize that there&#39;s a game from Bully Pulpit making basically the same joke with the title.  Oh well, consider this a working title.)

        <p>&quot;And it’s always obvious exactly how you should use GM moves and Defy Danger.&quot;<br /><br />I think you meant &quot;And it&#39;s <b>not</b> always obvious&quot;...<br /><br />Do you want to enable comments on that doc so we can give feedback?<br /><br /><b>Edit:</b> I like what you have so far.  I think that the Design Notes and example GM Moves you have on each category will be super-useful as well.  Definitely interested in seeing more (and would buy if you put it up somewhere for sale).</p>

        <p>I must admit to being in the &quot;less is more&quot; camp, that less rolls and rules are a good thing. That said, I like the Breath mechanic. It seems to hit that sweet spot of &quot;just enough&quot; structure to accomplish it&#39;s goal. The extra details for being on fire might be overkill though. I think that doing anything besides actively trying to extinguish yourself is Defying Danger.<br /><br />I&#39;ve seen mind control and chases come up before. I&#39;d be happy to share what I have, and maybe my starvation notes too.</p>

        <p>Custom moves are also helpful to set the tone for the environment. Starving and dying from thirst shouldn&#39;t be a problem unless you are in a desert. Drowning is not an issue unless you delve into the underwater temple etc. Great moves so far!</p>

This whole project is sort of an exercise in overkill. I&#39;ve got reasons for each thing I put in their so far, but it&#39;s definitely a work in progress.  <br /><br />I&#39;d definitely be interesting in seeing your notes on any custom moves you&#39;ve got. <b>That goes for everyone</b>.  If you&#39;ve got a solid custom move (or way to handle it as a GM) for a fairly common situation, send it my way.  If I end up using it, or being inspired by it, I&#39;ll be sure to credit you accordingly.</p>

        <p>Specific example/suggested GM Moves are great - it&#39;s difficult to adlib everything and for me an extra level of detail to the GM Moves in the core book is really useful.</p>

        <p>Here’s what I have for a mind control move.<br /><br />When something attempts to control or manipulate your mind, roll+WIS. *On a 10+, you shake it off. *On a 7-9, choose one:<br />•	You’re stunned for a few moments while you shake it off.<br />•	You feel a brief compulsion, take -1 forward to act against the source of the effect<br />*On a 6-, don’t mark XP yet. Instead, give the GM a notecard with your character’s name on it. <br /><br />When the GM hands you a notecard with your name on it, read the command on the back (to yourself, don&#39;t discuss it with others). Then choose one:<br />•	Do what it tells you to the best of your abilities, then mark XP and tear up the card.<br />•	Drop to your knees, clutch your head, and the source of the command deals its damage to you, ignoring armor. Then tear up the card.<br /><br /><br />For chases, there are two different versions. One resolves the chase in one roll, the other treats it as a contest of rolls.<br /><br />Chase (Quick version)<br /><br />When you are party to a chase, roll+DEX if you are in a complex area or +CON if you are in an open area. *On a hit, you either get away or catch up to your quarry. *On a 7-9, choose one:<br />•	Your foe gets a chance to strike back at you before the chase ends.<br />•	You attract unwanted attention.<br />•	It costs you something important.<br /><br /><br />Chase (Complex version)<br /><br />When you are party to a chase, the GM will tell you the initial distance between the quarry and the pursuer on the following range of distances: <br />Hand—Reach—Near—Far—Away<br /><br />Then roll+DEX if you are in a complex area or +CON if you are in an open area. *On a hit, increase or reduce the distance by one increment, your choice. *On a 7-9, choose one:<br />•	Your foe gets a chance to strike back at you.<br />•	You attract unwanted attention.<br />•	It costs you something important.<br />*On a 6-, the GM increases or reduces the distance by one increment. <br />When the distance is reduced to Hand, the quarry is caught. When the distance is increased to Away, the quarry has escaped.<br /><br /><br />This is the “Run away!” move I came up with for the West Marches style game I’m working on, since it does not allow for characters to be left out at the end of the session.<br /><br />When you have not escaped a danger by the end of the session or are forced to flee for your life from the dungeon, roll+either DEX or CON, your choice. *On a 10+, choose one from the list. *On a 7-9, choose two. *On a 6-, choose two, and the GM will also give you an additional, much worse consequence.<br />•	You leave behind something important, the GM will tell you what.<br />•	The experience scars you, take a debility of the GM’s choice.<br />•	You get lost or are forced to hide; it takes you a long time to get to safety.<br /><br />Thieves and halflings always take +1 to Run Away! Yes, a halfling thief gets both. If a character has the advanced move Escape Route, they use that move in lieu of Run Away!<br /><br /><br />For starvation, it would depend on how long you want people to be able to last. Without water, a person will only last a couple of days. On minimal food and water, it’s more like a few weeks. Likewise, the recovery time should be taken into consideration. The simplest version would be to take a debility for each day you go without eating.</p>

I recognize that index card one. Definitely one I was thinking about including.  It&#39;s a pretty specific flavor of mind control, though, like a post-hypnotic suggestion. I find that immediate compulsions tend to be more common in play.<br /><br />That&#39;s interesting with the chase. I like how you&#39;re combining both the cat and the mouse roles. I&#39;m not sure it&#39;s the best solution, though... the narrative structure of being the pursuer is very different than being the quarry, and success looks very different for the two different roles.  There&#39;s also the question of &quot;how do you deal with multiple PCs involved in the same chase?&quot;<br /><br />Hmm hmm hmm.  More to chew on.</p>

        <p>After reading the entirety of the Custom Moves section for inspiration, I came across some torch/light moves I really like (looks like you did too) and might fit with this supplement: <a href="https://plus.google.com/104675236432730777219/posts/CnDM3kgCRLQ" class="ot-anchor">https://plus.google.com/104675236432730777219/posts/CnDM3kgCRLQ</a></p>

        <p>An observation, so many games have rules for starving to death, when dying of thirst is a much more realistic threat. I always wonder why designers choose to include mechanics for eating but ignore staying hydrated. I imagine that there are water fountains scattered conveniently throughout dungeons.<br /><br />Rules for hypothermia/exposure might be good territory to cover, although since it&#39;s somewhat of a gradual process possibly more flavorful if played out over a series of defy dangers.</p>

        <p>I added the I&#39;ll lead the way move to the megadungeon section, I was originally writing it for freebooters, along with some input from others on the lampblack page. Could be a good starting point? I also posted up the labyrinth move that was discussed on the Discern Realities podcast.</p>
