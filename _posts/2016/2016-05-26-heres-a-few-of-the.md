Heres a few of the things I came up with for tonights game.<br />Mangrove Dryad and Fertiliser Zombies - Not nessicarily a combat encounter, but with my guys its definitely a possibility. Theres a Dryad in a mangrove swamp on the highly magical jungle island the players are stranded in, protecting her grove from theÂ magic hunters that live on the island.<br />She&#39;s not afraid to aggressively propagate her grove if given any chance at all, and many of the saplings in the grove use magically animated zombies as a cross between fertiliser bags and an defensive system.<br />The players have to pass through the grove to get to where they are going in any sort of time. If they decide to take the long route, its going to add another half a day to their journey.
