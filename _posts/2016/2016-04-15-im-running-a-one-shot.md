I&#39;m running a one shot of DW for my d&amp;d group next week and I&#39;d like to use the same characters. They are lvl 8 in d&amp;d. What should be an appropriate level for dw?

        <p>There is no real way to tell. A level 1 character in DW is very competent and can defeat many enemy&#39;s but doesn&#39;t get much stronger with each level.<br /><br />I would check what kind of abiliys are core to their characters and see if you can copy them in DW and at what level this would be possible.<br /><br />I personally would go Level 3 to 5 at maximum because level 6 already gives advanced moves which are significantly stronger. Also Dungeonworld tend to be more fun if the players options are limited and the bonuses aren&#39;t to high yet.</p>

        <p>D&amp;D 5.<br />Paladin, Ranger and Wizard.</p>

        <p>I agree somewhere before lvl 6 seems a good idea. I&#39;m leaning toward lvl 5 at the moment since at lvl 9, D&amp;D 5e characters step up as they reach powerful lvl 6 spells. Would that makes sense?</p>

        <p>i think you should go with your guts. Lvl 5 sounds alright.</p>

        <p>Depending about the difficulty of the trouble they are getting into I&#39;d say 4 or 5. If it&#39;s going to be a oneshot, give them higher levels (6 or 7) to show how awesome higher level games with DW can be.</p>

        <p>If it&#39;s just a one shot that won&#39;t play on the larger story just have them start at level one to test drive the system.</p>

        <p>Yeah, <span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink" href="https://plus.google.com/108408137525442565511" oid="108408137525442565511">Karlen Kendrick</a></span> beat me to it. If you&#39;re running a one shot for players that are new to <i>Dungeon World</i> then <b>DON&#39;T</b> try to convert their D&amp;D characters to DW characters. Just have them make brand new level 1 DW characters.<br /><br />Higher level DW characters have more moves, and if you&#39;re bringing in new players to &quot;test drive&quot; the system, more moves will just end up be more confusing.<br /><br />Also, if you convert their D&amp;D characters to DW characters, your players will try to play their characters the same way. The systems are very different, and your players could get frustrated that their characters don&#39;t do the same things.<br /><br />It&#39;s a one shot. Just let them make brand new characters so that they can have fun playing something different for a change.</p>

        <p>I converted a very long running campaign from D&amp;D4e to Pathfinder and then eventually DW. It was a complete paradigm shift each time that resulted in a fair amount of retcon (in some areas, drastically so). Ultimately, satisfaction was improved for all, but it was an arduous process, and each time it broke a bit of suspension of disbelief for a while. <br /><br />So I will amplify what Stonebush and Kendrick have said: for their first time out in DW, don&#39;t try to convert characters. Keep the setting if you&#39;re all invested in it, but start a new group. It&#39;s fun to see your story world from a new perspective. If everyone gets hyped on it, look at converting. <br /><br />If you do eventually do a conversion, you&#39;ll inevitably find yourself looking at Class Warfare (as I did). We went that route, and it was kludgy. In retrospect it would have been better to use unique playbooks, such as some of the excellent ones from Awful Good Games, or tweak/reflavor/customize existing ones. But I can drill down on that later if you wish.</p>

        <p>I made this mistake when I first discovered DW and was trying to coax my trad D&amp;D group. Not a good idea. It ends up not doing DW the Justice and fair shake it deserves because everyone is trying to play D&amp;D instead of playing DW.</p>
