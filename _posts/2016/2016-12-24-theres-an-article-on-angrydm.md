There&#39;s an article on AngryDM that discusses the tradeoffs between traveling fast and traveling cautiously. This might be a good place to offer some interesting choices or hard bargains, if the party wants to Undertake a Perilous Journey and move stealthily though a dangerous place, or try to go quicker at the expense of caution. Any ideas?

        <p>If the characters want to go faster, don&#39;t allow scouts. Disallow Trailblazers if they want to be slow and cautious. Spare players can Aid the lone Trailblazer/Scout (or Quartermaster). How&#39;s that?</p>

        <p>I think it should be up to the players to explain in the fiction how they want to travel. If you offer them the choices, they&#39;ll feel compelled to take one of them, rather then what they wanted. (doesn&#39;t mean they will, but they are compelled to.)</p>
