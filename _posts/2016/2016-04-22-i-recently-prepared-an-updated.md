I recently prepared an updated file for a friend running a Dungeon World, a Dungeon World novice care package and module update to my to my Zenopus Files collection. He wanted a dungeon to try out with his kids.<br /><br />This was the first dungeon that I converted for Dungeon World and the first dungeon I ever played back in a previous century when I was very young. I remember I added a Smaug style dragon for no really good reason in a &quot;second level&quot; except I had read and loved Tolkien&#39;s The Hobbit. I played with my very young sister and allowed her to befriend the dragon and &quot;conquer&quot; the level in a &quot;Monty Haul&quot; epic.<br /><br />Now my niece loves the Jackson films and has updated her own version of Dumb Ways to Die song to include icy orcs and dragon fire.
