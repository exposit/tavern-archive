<b>Animal Companion Playbook?</b><br /><br />Does anyone know of a playbook to play animal companions or familiars as characters or anything similar?

        <p>I think the Perilous Wilds has hireling rules for this that are the closest I&#39;ve seen</p>

        <p>Class Warfare is always your friend. :D<br /><br />Also: depending on what you want to be able to do, you could just pick a regular class and write up a new race/background move. A raven or crow as a Thief is a very neat fit, IMO.<br /><br />That&#39;s probably the route I&#39;d go, actually. Animal companions and familiars have diverse enough roles that I can&#39;t immediately imagine a single playbook doing all those roles justice.</p>
