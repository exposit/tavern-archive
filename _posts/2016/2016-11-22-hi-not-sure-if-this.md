Hi not sure if this is best place to post this but I want to say that I&#39;m a roleplayer interested in joining casual play by post games on Google plus.  I&#39;m part of one right now but since it&#39;s kinda slow I have the time to get into more than one.  I like many styles of fantasy and there&#39;s a special place in my heart for low or limited/costly magic.  I have a thief already written up from another campaign who I could use at lvl 1.

        <p>Do you know anyone else who will play? I can GM, though I warn you I&#39;m still starting out. I do have aa few games under my belt. Tell me the best day for you, and I will see if it fits in my schedule.</p>
