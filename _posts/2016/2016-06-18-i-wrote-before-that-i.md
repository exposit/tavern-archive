I wrote before that I would make World of Dungeons versions of the <a rel="nofollow" class="ot-hashtag" href="https://plus.google.com/s/%23Stonetop/posts">#Stonetop</a> classes and bow I have.  I gave most of the classes a slightly different wording of their &quot;Skill&quot; to differentiate such classes as the original thief and the stonetop Fox.  For abilities, I chose four moves from each playbook that are simple and work well with the simple game.  I believe that these slimmed down classes will allow people to play their stonetop classes and games but in a much simpler, lighter fashion. Parentheses are skills and abilities come after.  <br /><br />Heavy(brawn)  muscle-bound, payback, relentless, frosty, made of wood.<br /><br />Fox(trickery) sneaky, on the move, perfect instincts, nothing up my sleeves.<br /><br />Marshall(leadership) shield wall, battlefield grace, setup strike, we happy few.<br /><br />Ranger(woodcraft) on the hoof, big game hunter, camouflage, constant vigilance.<br /><br />The Blessed(awareness) wild speech, herbalist, heedless stride, into the lions den.<br /><br />Lightbearer(invigorate) lamplighter, inner fire, light more light, light a candle against the dark.  <br /><br />Judge(interpret) breaking of the bread, mighty rampart, censure, many hands make light work.  <br /><br />Seeker(arcane secrets) everything bleeds, magpie, sage advice, readied action, polyglot.<br /><br />The would be hero(hide) better part of valor, never going to keep me down, underestimated, inquiring minds.  <br /><br />Some stats may need to be halved in the damage or damage reduction department but apart from that I think this works.  Hope people like and enjoy these. <a rel="nofollow" class="ot-hashtag" href="https://plus.google.com/s/%23DungeonWorld/posts">#DungeonWorld</a> <a rel="nofollow" class="ot-hashtag" href="https://plus.google.com/s/%23WorldofDungeons/posts">#WorldofDungeons</a> <br /><br /><br /><br />ï»¿

The moves are simple but difficult to copy down all the text to describe them.  Found it easier to memorize them or use online reference or write on back of character sheet.</p>

        <p>If your interested, I&#39;ve been posting about five or six homemade world of Dungeons classes on the community.  They include Elf, Dwarf, Hobbit, Orator(or scholar), Craftsman(or wanderer), and fistfighter.  Ask and I&#39;ll reshare them to you.</p>

They might need a bit of tweaking, but it&#39;s a start.<br /><br />Wanderers get Navigation as their skill.  Choose two special abilities.  1Mend (Can attempt to repair  tools, armor, weapons, or trinkets). 2Apothecary (You can make a salve, brew, or poison, describe it). 3Craftsman (You know and ply a common trade and carry the tools you need). 4Artefact/Trinket (You&#39;ve found a special object in your travels.  Say how you found it and choose a description.  Artefact:. Strange, invaluable and powerful.  Trinket: Many uses, easily portable, and no serious danger.<br /><br />Fistfighters get Evasion as their skill.  Choose two special abilities.  1Swipe (when rushing by, you may attempt to take something right out of someone&#39;s hand). 2Vicious (you can strike armored opponents at weak points, dealing full damage and block/deflect weapons with your limbs). 3Lunge (Expose yourself to harm but deal 2x damage). 4 In control (Once a day, turn partial success into full success). 5Streetfighter<br />(+1 ongoing when your outnumbered, or outgunned). 6Elusive (-1d6 damage when focusing on defense over offense and are unarmed and have no shield or armor)</p>

        <p>navigation and evasion as skills seem perfect.<br /><br />What I would do is mixing Mend+Craftsman (as the latter is not very likely to get much real use in game) and separate the Trinket skill into two: Powerful, but dangerous trinket and Humble, versatile trinket.<br /><br />On the fistfighter, maybe take out Swipe (too weak compared with the others, also easily proxyed by a DEX save in case of need) and elusive. <br /><br />Anyhow, is a cool job, World of dungeons is too cool and i&#39;m always glad to see I&#39;m not the only one who is constantly hacking it. I&#39;ll probably keep your ideas for future inspiration!!</p>
