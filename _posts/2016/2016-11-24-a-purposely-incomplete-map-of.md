        <p>The Square on the very south west part of the map where the river meets the ocean is actually suppose to be a city, as is the hollow square across from the island. It&#39;s hard to see but there is also a hollow circle on the east coast on the north side of the river near the lake.<br /><br />Also the dot in the center of the continent where the two rivers meet has since been promoted to full town status, and could probably be turned into a filled square as it is now where the Nevwreth army would garrison during peace time since the rivers can let them quickly mobilize across the continents to where they&#39;re needed.</p>
