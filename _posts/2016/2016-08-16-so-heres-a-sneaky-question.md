So here&#39;s a sneaky question; What are your thoughts on this item?<br />I like the fictional concept but I&#39;m a little concerned the mechanics have already been covered:<br />Anonymous Notebook: [3 charges]<br />A haphazard collection of diagrams, codes, to-do-lists and rituals that on first glance look to be utterly useless. Upon closer inspection these are clearly the ruminations of an explorer very interested in studying the local area. <br />When a player faced with a dilemma outside of combat (mysterious plant, trap, puzzle, extortionist merchant, maybe even a broken bridge) chooses to consult this notebook roll 2d6+2. On a 10+ the player gains information very useful to the dilemma at hand. On a 7-9 the player finds information that is either vague or incomplete and a charge is expended. This notebook only contains information on the local area and can&#39;t be used more than a day&#39;s travel from it&#39;s point of discovery.

        <p>I like the idea, but why all the restrictions? Why the charges, the restriction in combat, and the geographical restriction?</p>

So the restrictions are an attempt to balance/focus it. <br />But I see where you&#39;re coming from it&#39;s a lot of restrictions, the charges don&#39;t actually have any fictional justification now that I think about it.</p>

        <p>I think many of the current restrictions could be implied (and pretty strongly) just with fiction. For example, saying it only describes the local area gives it a geographic restriction without having to get all mechanical. :)</p>

        <p>It makes no sense to use charges, since it&#39;s a notebook with a bunch of random knowledge.<br /><br />I would also use the PLAYER&#39;s INT for rolling, which implies that the knowledge is all there, assuming they can understand the incoherent scribbles the author made</p>

        <p>Personally instead of worrying about the item undermining Discern Realities, I&#39;d have it do something WITH discern realities you couldn&#39;t normally do... Either ask a unique question or take the better of two 2d6 rolls (one at the book&#39;s INT mod, and the other at the player&#39;s).<br /><br />Maybe the drawback is that the two discern realities will ALWAYS conflict.</p>

        <p>Thanks so much for the feedback everyone - I really appreciate it. So here is the reworked item;<br /><br />Anonymous Notebook: [charges - 3] Dear author of book, I don&#39;t know who you are or what you were up to but I am so very glad you&#39;re forgetful with your belongings.<br />A haphazard collection of diagrams, codes, to-do-lists and rituals in a tatty, tea-stained blue book. On first glance this information looks to be utterly useless but upon closer inspection it is clearly the ruminations of an explorer gathering very select information on the local area. <br />When a player uses this notebook to aid them in a Discern Realities or Spout Law roll a 7-9 result automatically gets treated as 10+ at the cost of one charge. <br /><br />I wanted a simple reward for the first encounter of a one-shot and I think this hits the mark.<br />It&#39;s beneficial for all classes equally, it doesn&#39;t make Discern Realities, Spout Law or the Bag of Books redundant. Also the number of charges can easily be tweaked to make it a high power item if need be.<br /><br />Thanks all o/</p>
