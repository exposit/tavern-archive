Is there a site that I can find home brewed moves for this game? :)

        <p>Custom moves are almost always situational. Are you looking for anything specific?</p>

        <p>I would like to see what others already achieved and use some of them time to time or get some ideas, at least.</p>

        <p>There is a &quot;Custom Moves&quot; section of this community. You can also take a look at various third party playbooks for their class moves.</p>

        <p>Reading through and thinking about Class Warfare,  a DW supplement by <span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink" href="https://plus.google.com/113864117304127544117" oid="113864117304127544117">Johnstone Metzger</a></span>​​, really helped me understand playbook creation specifically, and gave me good insights into crafting moves, generally.<br /><br />Beyond that,  watching and participating in G+ conversations has been a phenomenal help. <br /><br />Finally - play a lot, and don&#39;t be afraid to make mistakes.   Well-played DW is improvising,  and that means be daring, be assertive.</p>
