PbtA/*World Enemies. So I know how they work in a few different hacks, but it seems to me that if you were going to create a supplement with enemies that you wanted to be &quot;generic&quot; for as many hacks as possible it would be fiddly to get the enemies just right. In your opinion which system&#39;s enemies embody the most commonly-used enemy rules. Which elements (agendas, for example), should be present in any enemy, no matter the hack?
