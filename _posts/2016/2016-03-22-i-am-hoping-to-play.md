I am hoping to play today. I worked up Kith Banu and Taefala as followers as per Perilous Wilds rules. If anyone wants a couple of followers for their DW campaign. One is a Horseclan Scout and musician and acolyte of the Goddess of Music. The other is a stalwart protector serving the Goddess of Justice. Both are on one page in the pdf and complete with art my little ol&#39; me. <br /><br /><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0By5dAjwDgmCHMTJsWk4tSkVKUTA/view?usp=sharing" class="ot-anchor">https://drive.google.com/file/d/0By5dAjwDgmCHMTJsWk4tSkVKUTA/view?usp=sharing</a>

        <p>Btw, I will do a write up later of the adventure that two Followers up there were particpants.  Both were taken out in a grueling encounter with ghouls guarding the Lost Song of Change.  Both were saved by last minute, last ditch healing... but Kith is paralyzed from the waist down.  But without the two followers, it most likely would have been a total party kill.  </p>
