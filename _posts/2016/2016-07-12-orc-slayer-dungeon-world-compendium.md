        <p>Been looking at a lot of your Compendium classes. Most of them seem extremely 2 denominational.<br />This ork slayer one for example, you get the ability to track a single ork, which granted is a cool concept, is kind of made moot by the fact  you also get a move that does double damage to orks, which means you will rarely ever have an ork survive an attack.<br /><br />Both of the mentioned and &quot;foul disguise&quot; are also WAY to specific and would only be good choices if you knew the rest of your campaign would be spent fighting orks. The moment you move on to something else those moves are wasted.<br /><br />Giving a character another class&#39;s move is a HUGE no, no. Because it takes away from what what made that character unique. You can have a move that function similarly, or have the same trigger, but you should just uplift a move directly from another class. You&#39;re just stepping on the other character&#39;s toes rather then enabling the first.<br /><br />Cavern sight is just dull, how does hating orks even lead to you having infra-vision? There also needs to be some kind of trigger, because it&#39;s just a boring as it is.<br /><br />Compendium Classes, should be more fleshed out then just 3 or 4 moves. (You don&#39;t even add any flavor text to the moves.) They should be like half classes, that expand the character in a direction the base class couldn&#39;t normally.</p>

        <p>I think this is an evocative idea but the level up moves don&#39;t really do it for me. How about something like<br /><br /><del>revenant</del> when sent to the Black Gates by an Orc, roll with a +1<br />Or<br /><del>Orc Bane</del> all Orcs know of you. When you parley with orcs (something, +1, ?)<br /><br />The class is super specific but I think specificity often works with compendium classes.</p>

I was just playing around with some ideas for a series of linked adventures to stop an orc invasion; with various specific orc related classes/items. I was trying for simplicity in the moves and language; to allow maximum applicability. I tried going fictionally even broader with &quot;Assassin for Justice&quot; which may work better.</p>
