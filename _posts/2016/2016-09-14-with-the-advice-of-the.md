With the advice of the nice folks of /r/DungeonWorld, I wrote a Pathfinder inspired Summoner class, for a possible campaign conversion. This is the first draft. Feedback would be greatly appreciated!<br /><br /><a href="https://gist.github.com/Castux/ae39c3ee109a1f33ecf0ca77b8d37f7a" class="ot-anchor">https://gist.github.com/Castux/ae39c3ee109a1f33ecf0ca77b8d37f7a</a>

        <p>I like the concept of an other-world companion, but as it, it&#39;s not that thrilling. It basically is a mis-shapen doppleganger, which may or may not act on its own, but can be dispelled at any time.<br /><br />It seems that if you can access other planes, that by itself would be pretty awesome. Maybe  you could expand that portion to allow for some spell-casting or a ritual effect.<br /><br />At the very least, you could give the Eidolist powers which enhance the class (additional discern realities when the Eidolist is able to observe, spout lore with the Eidolist acting as the accumulated knowledge.)<br /><br />I want to know why these guys are awesome. Especially since I don&#39;t really know them all that well.<br /></p>

        <p>&quot;It seems that if you can access other planes, that by itself would be pretty awesome.&quot;<br /><br />You do get the Contact Spirits spell, and later Perfect Summons. Also there is the Void Gate move which lets you actually travel to another plane. <br /><br />&quot;allow for some spellcasting or a ritual effect&quot;<br /><br />Spellcasting is a starting move of the class. Limited, because it&#39;s not the main focus of the class, but it&#39;s there.<br /><br />&quot;additional discern realities when the Eidolist is able to observe&quot;<br /><br />That is exactly what the Planar Sensibility move does.<br /><br />&quot;I want to know why these guys are awesome.&quot;<br /><br />Well, because you can make them take any shape you can possibly want and control them with your mind. Also they&#39;re pretty much immortal. Seems like a pretty cool toy to me...<br /><br />As much as I appreciate the time you took to comment, I do get the feeling that you haven&#39;t actually... read the whole thing? Unless I misinterpreted of course.</p>

        <p>You have some nice ideas in your class, a few suggestions:<br /><b>Remove spell casting:</b> I understand you are trying to translate pathfinder&#39;s summoner but the summoner having light for example doesn&#39;t make much sense (you could do this by giving an option to have the eidolon glow as bright as a torch as a form of adaptation for example). The other spells can be made into moves.<br /><br /><b>eidolon:</b> If it&#39;s not meant to have a strong presence, make it into a hireling. If it is meant to be used like your character then you can use the summon monster spell and/or the ranger&#39;s animal companion for ideas.</p>

        <p>I just missed the cast spell move. It looked like there was the summon and the mindlink.</p>

Maybe it should be a multiclassing move instead.</p>
