So I am wanting to make a healer class that doesn&#39;t involve powers from a diety. So please shoot me some ideas for advanced moves and starting moves. For example I thought that the healer should be able to make salves and healing potions as a starter move.

For clarity, I&#39;m assuming leaving out deities doesn&#39;t mean leaving out magic, so, they could use your own variation on Reiki energy manipulation or acupuncture (great for combat too). Whenever people rest, they get half their health, you could add moves that increase this (2-5, 75%, 5-10, boost to full?). Just some ideas to get the discussion going. </p>

        <p>Look into modern first aid and what techniques they use. Things like the &quot;Dying Breath&quot; to give people +1 to their Last Breath move or something would be interesting, aside from normal bandaging and whatnot</p>

        <p>You could alternately expand on the Druid&#39;s Balance move, or the Sacred Lamb from <i>Class Warfare</i>.<br />It&#39;s pretty easy to give a class a move &quot;When you <b>do thing</b>, heal 1d8&quot; and an advanced option &quot;When you <b>do better thing</b>, heal 2d8&quot;.  The question is where you want to go from there.  Where do the healing powers come from?  What else would someone with those powers be able to do?  What can they heal other than damage?  What else are they good at, <b>other</b> than healing?   I think it&#39;s usually important that they feel useful in combat.<br /><br />A Chinese Doctor is a scholar-type character, and could borrow ideas from the Wizard and Bard.  A Mutant Psionic healer might have any number of psi powers.  A Herbalist Witch healer might have all kinds of potions and nature trickery.  What are you going for?</p>

        <p>Wow a lot of good ideas. I was thinking the healing came from light magic.</p>

        <p>I like the acupuncture thing. Knowing the different pressure points to inflict damage.</p>

        <p>So salves and healing potions, using pressure points to their advantage, when at camp healing group for certain amount, the dying breath move, the scholar aspect is cool, the knowledge of plants and stones is something I would use. What else can we add???</p>

        <p>For the fiction, a lot depends on the tone of the campaign. For a lot of games, especially high-action Hollywood style, you can simply rationalize it with &quot;the injury wasn&#39;t actually as bad as it looked at first&quot; or &quot;it&#39;s more pain than &#39;injury,&#39; so you&#39;re inspiring people to overcome it&quot; kind of stuff, for when stuff like acupuncture, psychic healing, etc. simply wouldn&#39;t feel appropriate.</p>

        <p>The alchemist covers allot of this in its potion move.<br /><br />Maybe narrow the alchemist into something more specialized?</p>

        <p>I thought the Medic class was a good take on the &quot;mundane healer&quot; concept<br /><a href="http://www.mediafire.com/view/?7fi8fc15iy55k8j" class="ot-anchor">http://www.mediafire.com/view/?7fi8fc15iy55k8j</a></p>

You could have something like:<br />When you channel mystical forces to heal a wound, roll+CON(or CHA or WIS or INT, depending on your flavour). *On a hit, heal 1d12. *On a 7-9, choose one:<br />- The healing drains you, take damage equal to half the healed amount (rounded down, minimum 1)<br />- You loose control of the mystical energies, gain a disability in your rolled stat until you can take an extended rest and cleanse your chakras.<br />- The healing is less effective, halve the amount healed (rounded down, minimum 1)</p>
