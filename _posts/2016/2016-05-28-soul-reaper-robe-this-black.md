<b>Soul Reaper Robe</b><br />This black and purple velvet robe is adorned with delicately stitched necromantic symbols.  The inner lining is inscribed with the words, &quot;to my dearest pupil.&quot;  While wearing the robe, you can make a necrotic touch attack (range Hand) against a creature with a soul.  If your attack kills the creature, the robe gains +1 Soul.  The next time you roll Last Breath, roll +Soul instead of the flat 2d6.  Additionally, all the souls in the robe are released into what lies beyond the Black Gate, and it reverts back to 0 Soul.  1 Weight<br />

        <p>You should probably limit the amount of Soul the robe can hold... probably a maximum of 3?<br /><br />Thinking about it, the souls you&#39;re harvesting would have gone to the Black Gate anyway when they died, so you&#39;re just delaying their journey slightly.  At least, that&#39;s the way a good-aligned character can rationalise it to themselves...<br /><br />Very nice item :)</p>
