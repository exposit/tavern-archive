It appears I&#39;ll be running an occasional ongoing game of Dungeon World.Â  I&#39;ve done quite a number of one-shots, often teaching the system as I do so.<br /><br />I was hoping some of you helpful people might direct me toward anything I should know that will make this easier?Â  I&#39;ve been running by the book since it first arrived, and my typical one-shots were always improvised.Â  What&#39;s changed?Â  What wisdom has been learned?<br /><br />And yes <span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink" href="https://plus.google.com/108530078404383929502" oid="108530078404383929502">Jason Cordova</a></span>, I&#39;ll be mining Discern Realities for advice/ideas.

        <p>I definitely recommend player goals, I kind of accidently did this first time I played but my bard wanted to become a ruler, my druid wanted to bring his people to a good home, and there were others as well.<br /><br />Fronts can be personal.</p>

        <p>Have a group concept, some sort of group goal, and maybe personal goals. Get it all out there so there can be some directed play, instead of nonsense flailing.<br /><br />I think this applies to most RPGs, though.</p>

        <p>Don&#39;t be afraid to have and push your own ideas. Â Asking the characters is great, but it&#39;s your job to push and curate ideas and cultivate as coherent a world as you can.</p>

Instead of the other way around.<br /><br />But as I said milege may vary</p>

        <p>Thanks everyone who has (and who still may) offered suggestions.Â  I&#39;ve got some time now to go over things and figure out the best way of incorporating your advice.</p>
