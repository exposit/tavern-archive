First of all, excuse my &quot;fabulous&quot; English!<br /><br />....They were walking in the mountains when it begins to fall one acidic rain that emerged from the sky. To protect themselves of it, they enter a small crack that was close. shortly after, when they go into the depths of the slot, hear sounds of walls moving up, getting stuck in a cell whose walls (which were full of hieroglyphic not repeated) seem to be to move (joining each other). ...<br /><br />The players, after having tried several spells and brute force to get out of there, were more committed and found that on the ground was written on a small Lapide a phrase that had a question whose answer could be the solution to exit this increasingly small room ...<br /><br />What hieroglyphic have to touch on the wall to leave the room?<br />Â ... (view card image) <br /><br /><br />Something similar can be done with &quot;N&quot; cards with different puzzles, more or less difficult and draw them randomly in similar situations ...<br />What about the idea (and the implementation, of course)? : D
