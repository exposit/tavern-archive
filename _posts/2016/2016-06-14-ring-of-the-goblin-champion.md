Ring of the Goblin Champion<br /><br />&quot;You better mind yer parunts, an&#39; yer teachurs fond an&#39; dear,<br />An&#39; churish them &#39;at loves you, an&#39; dry the orphant&#39;s tear,<br />An&#39; he&#39;p the pore an&#39; needy ones &#39;at clusters all about,<br />Er the Gobble-uns &#39;ll git you<br />Ef you<br />Don&#39;t<br />Watch<br />Out!&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Little Orhant Annie&quot;,  James Whitcomb Riley<br /><br />This silver band bordered in gold is engraved with animal knotwork. When you wear the ring, it gives you the following moves.<br /><br />When you greet a band of goblins with open palms, they see you as a fellow goblin, regardless of your actual appearance.  Roll CHA+.  On a 10+, You are treated as an ally and choose one.<br /><br />-Your friends are also treated as allies.<br /><br />-One goblin in the band will offer his services as a hireling.<br /><br />-The band tells you the location of a guarded or trapped treasure<br /><br />On a 7-9, you are treated as an ally.  On a miss, you are perceived as a goblin but treated with suspicion.<br /><br /><br />When you parley with goblins, you may claim to be a champion of Goblinkind as leverage.  This does not change the likelihood of success or the consequences of the roll.

        <p>Nice, though I would word it like this:<br /><br />This silver band bordered in gold is engraved with animal knotwork. While you wear the ring, goblins will see you as a fellow goblin, regardless of your actual appearance. You may also claim to be a champion of Goblinkind as leverage when you Parly with goblins.<br /><br />When you greet a band of goblins with open palms, roll+CHA.  On a hit you are treated as an ally, and on a 10+ choose one:<br />-Your friends are also treated as allies.<br />-One goblin in the band will offer his services as a hireling.<br />-The band tells you the location of a guarded or trapped treasure.<br /><br />That simplifies the wording a bit I think. I&#39;m not a fan of 6- clauses as I feel it boxes in the GM.</p>

        <p>That is good, and semantically equivalent.<br /></p>
