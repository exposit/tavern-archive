Can anyone shed some light upon why the rules for monster group attacks (take highest damage dice and add + 1 for additional monsters) is different from the helpful DW guide (roll damage for each monster and take the highest amount). Was there a rules change in development. Which one are folks using?

        <p>If you roll once for each monster and take the highest you are not taking into consideration the number of monsters. Be aware of the wording, it says &quot;roll the highest&quot; not &quot;take the highest&quot;. For instance if a cave rat 1d6 and a Choker 1d10 are attacking, you roll 1d10+1 for damage. ﻿(1 piercing for the rat)</p>

        <p>Yup, the rules were originally &quot;roll for each critter and take the highest.&quot;  I think that was in the old &quot;Red Box&quot; version of DW?  But at some point the official rules switched to &quot;roll the highest damage die, add +1 for every extra foe).<br /><br />I believe the design intent was to make mobs scarier, and to make a heavily armored paladin/fighter/etc still vulnerable to them.  If you&#39;ve got armor 6 (shield + plate + steel hide), you&#39;re invulnerable to damage from anything rolling a d6.  But you&#39;re <i>not</i> immune to 6 things rolling a d6.  </p>
