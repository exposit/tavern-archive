Taking a page from <span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink" href="https://plus.google.com/118088719859349999400" oid="118088719859349999400">Mark Tygart</a></span>, I am trying to use the alien from the Star Trek TNG episode &quot;The Skin of Evil&quot; and combining it with the Symbiotes of Venom and Carnage for a alternative take of Pitch Black.  I was thinking about maybe doing a variation of a gelatinous cube or a chaos ooze.  Any ideas?

        <p>I&#39;d use a Black Pudding as a base personally: <a href="http://www.dungeonworldsrd.com/monsters#TOC-Black-Pudding" class="ot-anchor">http://www.dungeonworldsrd.com/monsters#TOC-Black-Pudding</a><br /><br />Adventurers give a monster a whole lot more respect when they realise it can eat their precious loot.</p>

        <p>Here is what I got so far:<br /><br />Second Skin<br />Solitary, Amorphous<br />Dominating touch (d10 damage, ignores armor);<br />15 HP; 1 Armor<br />Close<br />Special Qualities: Amorphous<br />How do you kill a pile of goo? A great, squishy pile of goo that also happens to want to take you over and use you as a means of transportation? That is a good question to which I have no answer. Do let us know when you find out.<br /><br />Instinct: To control<br />Draw sustenance by eating away your skin<br />Ooze over the entire body</p>
