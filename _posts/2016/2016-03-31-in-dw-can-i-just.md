In DW, can I just disregard the 3-18 stats and just say &quot;I have +2 STR and -1 DEX&quot; or is there other rules that are tied to the 3-18 stat score?

        <p>Hit points, I believe.  But that&#39;s easily dropped too.</p>

        <p>Only HP is tied to the full stats. You could modify it to be something like: Base + Level + Con Modifier. It&#39;d make for a deadlier game.<br /><br />The other important thing to note is that you will need to change how the &quot;+1 stat per level&quot; works. You might want to say something like... Add +1 at even levels, to a max plus of half your level (so you can&#39;t hit +3 on a stat until level 6)</p>

        <p>Advancement ties into the 3-18 score, since you get to improve a single stat by 1 point/level.<br /><br />But really, they are there (in my mind) because 3-18 ranges for abilities are an old-school trope. Same thing goes for hit points.<br /><br />I do agree that these notions can be dispensed with easily enough. You end up with a game that had less of a retro feel but there is noting wrong with that, if that&#39;s what you&#39;re after.</p>

        <p>There are also a few prices for things in the equipment chapter that subtract the player&#39;s charisma score from the cost, but that&#39;s not really all that important :P</p>

I find it weird they stick to the old D&amp;D tropes. Even D&amp;D 5e wouldn&#39;t have needed 3-18 stats, actually.</p>

        <p>1) having 3-18 stats makes the passages from +2 to +3 harder than, say, +1 to +2, or -1 to 0. Strangely, 0 to +1 is the most difficult. <br /><br />2) If you opt for having just modifiers, and you want to keep HP similar to the actual ones, you may go for this: <br /><br />HP: 10 + actual base + 3 CON.<br /><br />to keep the hit points pretty much like the actual ones.</p>

        <p>I think sticking to the old D&amp;D tropes was part of the point, actually. Dungeon World is a bit of a love letter to D&amp;D. Some of those choices -- stats from 3-18, hit points, etc. - are just the perfume on that letter. <br /><br />Which is not to say I wouldn&#39;t play a DW game without those notions, I would. I just like it better with them intact.</p>

        <p>The same problem comes up a lot in discussions of the post 3e editions of D&amp;D, or at least they tend to in the circles I travel. Chock it up to the whole &quot;d20+stat mod &gt;= Difficulty&quot; task resolution vs &quot;Roll under your stat with the d20/3d6/whatever&quot; method. The latter definitely gives the full number some bite.<br /><br />A lot of OSR types have come up with ways of using the 3-18 range for other stuff: carry your Strength in encumbering items is popular, Charisma for number/quality of contacts at character creation, number of starting skills with Intelligence, DCC&#39;s Luck stat, etc. Plenty of good ideas out there.</p>

        <p>there is one fan-made character class, the Brute, that has a Load of 10+Strength rather than 10+STR</p>

You just need a little work, &#39;cause there are very few (and minor) things directly related to that oooold (and hated, by me) 3-18 range. Blame old D&amp;D for that (OT: by the way, True20 was a good d20 based system that removed a lot of things I ever disliked of standard d20 system: 3-18 stats, fixed classes, vancian magic, standard hitpoints, finally it used just the d20, not the other dice that you used maybe just in combat damages).<br />I&#39;m working on a full DW modding for my group that remove those (almost useless) stats, but I have no full good text to share, sorry about that. However if you like to thinker with the systems, you&#39;ll find your way to address hit points etc.<br /><br />You have my blessing ^____^</p>

        <p>I&#39;m finding this discussion helpful, too! Q: Several people have brought up getting rid of HP. What would you /replace/ it with, or, how else do you track near-dead-ness?<br /></p>

        <p>Fate uses conditions. You could try that?</p>

        <p>I still use HPs, in Dungeon World, simply have a different formula (table) to calculate them, &#39;cause I removed the 3-18 COS.<br />I kept them because:<br />- I like them, for that specific kind of game (sort of videogame health bar)<br />- they are too diply integrated in the rest of the rules. If you want to use other systems (ie. AW harm, or Fate/Cortex+ conditions) you need to rewrite 50% of the whole book :D moves, weapon damage system, monsters etc. At that point, it&#39;s better fully switch to another system, and try to import some nice DW feature (success with cost in mixed results, failure that has always a meaning, and bring the things forward however, bonds, etc.). I can suggest one of the Cortex+ iterations, like the Fantasy Heroic that you can find in the Cortex Plus Hackers Guide.</p>
