I pretty much understand the basic concepts and rules, but I have a hard time with the fiction. For example, I can describe the extreme basics of what happens in the fight, but I&#39;m not that great at impromptu. Also, I find trouble describing what happens in town and running the actual plot with NPC&#39;s and such. I can barely describe the world around the PC&#39;s! Any tips on how to put more narrative into my game? <br />

        <p>Are you running a game or getting ready to run a game? I ask because simply following the agenda and principles, and making GM moves should inject <i>some</i> fiction into the game. Just by how the rules work.<br /><br />Also, I don&#39;t feel you&#39;re meant to &quot;run a plot&quot; in DW. As GM you&#39;re meant to follow where the PCs go, have NPCs react to their actions, and follow your Fronts and Dangers.</p>

        <p>Be obvious, don&#39;t try to be overly creative. Just say something concrete. &quot;He punches you in the face&quot; is better than &quot;the orc cocks back his arm, rage in his eyes before he lets out a gutteral yowl and swings his meaty fist towards you, connecting with your chin.&quot;</p>

        <p>If I don&#39;t know what to say next I &quot;ask questions and use the answers&quot;.     Then build on the fiction together. <br /><br />Player: What does this guy (a fence) look like?<br />Me: I don&#39;t know.  What does he look like? <br />Player: He&#39;s got a scar running down the right side of his face,  over his eye. <br />Me: This man, Jorgezera,  keeps one side of his face hidden in shadow. With a voice like gravel grinding together he asks &quot;well, zit you what has the di&#39;mond?&quot; What do you do?<br /><br />My problem in the past has been &quot;what do I say&quot; rather than &quot;how do I say it&quot;. Asking questions gives me the kick I need to move forward.</p>

        <p>To add narrative just ask yourself why?<br />Why are the bandits in the old church?<br />Because the first king&#39;s crown was buried with him there.<br />Why do the bandits want the crown?<br />The one who owns the crown has claim on the entire kingdom, so a noble would pay handsomely for it.</p>

Is that right?<br /><br />Like, correct me if I&#39;m wrong, but it sounds like you&#39;re having trouble with:<br /><br />1) Visualizing the fictional situation (where everyone is, what the scene looks like, who&#39;s doing what, what the momentum looks like, etc.)<br /><br />2) Describing that situation in a way that is clear to the other players.<br /><br />3) Framing scenes (especially in town): where the PCs are, who they&#39;re talking to, when to zoom in vs zoom out, and so forth.<br /><br />4) Playing the roles of NPCs (speaking in their voice, giving them distinct character, etc.)<br /><br />Is that the sort of thing you&#39;re looking for advice on?  Or more about how to move the plot along?</p>

        <p>A few things I&#39;ve learned while running Dungeon World games:<br /><br />1) I don&#39;t need to think up the &#39;perfect&#39; move; if I say the first thing that comes to mind, interesting things will probably still happen.  Trust your instincts.  Encourage your players to trust theirs.<br /><br />2) If you&#39;re stuck, ask the characters.  Sometimes even if you&#39;re not stuck, ask the characters.  This gives your players a chance to signal what they&#39;re interested in exploring and it also gives them a chance to trigger scenes to work on bonds and further develop their characters.<br /><br />3) Don&#39;t forget to <i>Think Dangerous</i>.  If things start to stall, pick a soft GM move from your list like <i>show signs of an approaching threat</i>, <i>put someone in a spot</i> or <i>present an opportunity, with or without cost</i>.  If you can&#39;t think of a danger, look to your fronts for inspiration.  If the fronts don&#39;t seem to fit right now, describe a vague sound, sense of doom, smell, etc and ask one of the characters to elaborate on it.</p>

Bad combat decision, you get hurt. Bad decision when travelling, you lose a ration?<br /><br />Combat is just an obstacle. Overcoming a dangerous jungle can and should be as interesting as assaulting a giant werebear.</p>

        <p>I have plenty of time to prep, I tried to make a front, but it wasn&#39;t that good. I made another one, and it was little improvement on the first. Mostly I am just on improv...</p>

        <p>I ask because it sounds like you want help narrating what&#39;s happening in the world around the PCs. Having Dangers, Fronts, or even just notes about those things written up should be a great help in doing that.<br /><br />Can I ask what&#39;s going on in your world? I know you want general tips, but those are rather hard to give.</p>

        <p>I wad thinking of starting an entirely new session with my group because the storyline was so bad. <br /><br />In my previous world, the adventurers were wandering around the world and fighting off a lot of goblins and kobolds. There was no real plot, and I didn&#39;t know much about how to handle traveling so we pretty much stayed in the same spot.<br /><br />The thing I need is a full length text adventure that was run by someone who knows what they are talking about.</p>
