<b>H’la Hourglass</b> <i>(weight ½, unique)</i><br />Crawling in desperation in an ocean of burning sand, an orphaned baby found a crystalline pearl. The lustrous stone gave the baby shelter, nurture, warmth, and virtuosity in whatever the child needed. Little is known in this legend about the baby’s adulthood; only that when its mortal life was ending, the now elder creature made a pilgrimage. It sculpted this pearl into the shape of a minute hourglass, grinding the inside of the pearl to make the translucent grit that tells not time, but possibilities. A single grain that’s the purest of prisms can sometimes be seen flowing among the variegated shining whites of the sands in it. Stories recall this object as being able to can turn past into future, cold into hot, night into day, and even death into life.
