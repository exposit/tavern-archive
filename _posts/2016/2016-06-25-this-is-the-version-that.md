Thank you to the kind Andrew Fish. I am keeping the other up as a learning tool to myself and others. This is now the official version for Dungeon World.     They are the dust of terrible progress. Art by Zdzislaw Beksinski  ...

        <p>After &quot;piercing 2&quot; there is a comma. Any tag missing?</p>

        <p>That is poor editing on my part, <span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink" href="https://plus.google.com/101076298485951808085" oid="101076298485951808085">Andrea Parducci</a></span>â€‹. There was another tag at one point, but it was removed to allow for a better and streamlined version. Thank you for your question though.</p>
