Hello! The Gauntlet has a new show called Comic Strip AP. For people who follow the <i>Discern Realities</i> podcast, it&#39;s inspired by the short bit of AP <span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink" href="https://plus.google.com/116842813466282234979" oid="116842813466282234979">David LaFreniere</a></span> and I do on that show. It&#39;s kind of an anthology series featuring a number of different short, 1v1 actual plays. One of those is for Dungeon World, and I have included some links here for those episodes if you want to check them out. <br /><br />Episode 1 (linked below)<br /><br />Episode 2<br /><a href="http://www.gauntlet-rpg.com/comic-strip-ap/dungeon-world-domenico-castafiel-02" class="ot-anchor">http://www.gauntlet-rpg.com/comic-strip-ap/dungeon-world-domenico-castafiel-02</a><br /><br />Episode 3<br /><a href="http://www.gauntlet-rpg.com/comic-strip-ap/dungeon-world-domenico-castafiel-03" class="ot-anchor">http://www.gauntlet-rpg.com/comic-strip-ap/dungeon-world-domenico-castafiel-03</a><br /><br />Let us know what you think!
