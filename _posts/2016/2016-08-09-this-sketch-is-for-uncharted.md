This sketch is for Uncharted Worlds and was a bit of a challenge.  <br /><br />My character&#39;s backstory is that he is from the underwater cities of Europa and his ship was one of the first survey ships sent from earth to Europa.  Now, there is no artificial gravity (we are taking a lot of queues from the Expanse), so the ship &quot;stacks&quot; over the main thrust to simulate gravity.  But this ship also is a submersible to descend into the depths of Europa&#39;s oceans.  <br /><br />So I came up with the &quot;Flying Fin&quot;.  <br /><br /><a href="http://i2.photobucket.com/albums/y35/Storn/DOC_zpsk5xbnx1m.jpg" class="ot-anchor">http://i2.photobucket.com/albums/y35/Storn/DOC_zpsk5xbnx1m.jpg</a>
