The party stays in the "unsettling" town of Deville before setting out to the Dungeon of the Nine Hells. Are the townspeople up to no good or is Krazius still off his meds? Starring Mike Robertson, Jeffrey Nye, Ronnie "Verge" Whitmire and Brandt "Cherry Pie" Wetzel. dungeoneerspodcast.com| facebook.com/dungeoneerspodcast| @dungeoneerspod
