        <p>Mmm, I feel this over complicated. You want to remove HPs (that, however, you could describe as &quot;Stress Points&quot; or &quot;Stamina&quot; if you don&#39;t like the starting &quot;health&quot; idea), but you introduce &quot;custom&quot; pieces (proficiency, Armor rolls - while you of course could ha me this as a soft GM move &quot;take away their stuff&quot;). However, thanks for sharing that.</p>

        <p>I concede you that this change forces to re-write many special abilities. But I&#39;m currently doing that anyways. Also bear in mind that many enemies will have little (skeletons, bandits, etc) to no armor (barfights, undead, wild animals)</p>
