Came up with this treasure item on the fly during a Roll20 game yesterday.  My random treasure generator indicated a vial of light blue fluid and I came up with ...<br /><br /><b>Potion of Ethereal Doors</b><br />This glass vial contains shimmering, light blue liquid.  Pour the contents of the vial against any wall, and an ethereal door will form there, allowing free passage through.  It will last a few minutes before disappearing.  1 use
