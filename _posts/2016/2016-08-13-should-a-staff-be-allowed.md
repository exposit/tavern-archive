Should a Staff be allowed the <i>Precise</i> tag?<br /><br />And if it could, how would one go about having that tag added within a story?<br /><br />I have ideas, but wanted to get the community&#39;s oppinions﻿

        <p>Could be a very thin rigid staff allowing for precise strikes. Would seem an uncommon thing though. Character would have to explain in his back story (i.e. the monastery of satay trained me).</p>

        <p>Yep, it&#39;s important to keep in mind that a staff will usually just be a walking-stick or some other weighted weapon. Quarterstaffs were, as I recall, tipped with iron! Certainly not a precise weapon.<br /><br />So a Precise staff would be one specifically designed for fast, dextrous strokes. It would have to be light, but durable enough to not snap on contact with an enemy.</p>

        <p>I gave <i>The Fox</i> class (for Stonetop) this move: <br /><br /><b>Skill at Arms</b><br />When you wield a sword, spear, or staff, it gains the <i>precise</i> tag. <br /><br />(Daggers are already <i>precise</i> in Stonetop.)</p>

        <p>the initial answer is &quot;yes&quot; but I&#39;d say that you can add the precise tag to anything, if the fiction points in that direction. Essentially, if the story justifies a thing, do the thing, but I&#39;m less comfortable with picking a thing and then trying to make the story fit it.</p>

        <p>As to &quot;how would one add that tag in a story&quot;, I would suggest that maybe they make modifications to the staff to make it more suited for combat--or find someone who knows how to modify it! That would make a great hook, and it totally falls under &quot;tell them the consequences/requirements and ask&quot;. More &quot;mundane&quot; things like that can be great ways to explore your world.</p>

        <p>Depending on how extensive the modifications to the staff can be, you could steal the concept from the protagonist&#39;s sword in the Book of the New Sun by Gene Wolfe.  It had a hollow core with mercury in it, meaning the blade was light and agile when held upright but the weight ran to the end and gave increased momentum when swung.<br /><br />So you could either create this staff or allow it to be retro-fitted to an existing staff with a bit of drilling and magical hardening:<br /><br />This staff has a hollow core containing an amount of dense liquid metal that responds to the wielder&#39;s mental commands.  This allows them to vary where the weight is distributed at will - the staff gains the <i>precise</i> tag.</p>

        <p>As any good elf fighter knows, you can choose to apply the precise tag to any weapon, given appropriate fiction and/or racial moves!</p>

        <p>When you say a Staff with the Precise tag, I am imagining those Bo Staves  with tapered ends like a toothpick.<br />Sorta like this:<br /><a href="http://www.wmaonline.com/bo-staff-2-piece-graphite-tapered" class="ot-anchor">http://www.wmaonline.com/bo-staff-2-piece-graphite-tapered</a><br /><br />That is what I imagine.  While DW is general enough, the fiction should point to the fact that this type of staff is perfect for thrusts and trips but not full blocking of a sword.  Anytime the response is &quot;I block with my staff&quot; it should be more of a Parry, any &quot;Block&quot; is likely to get the staff broken.  Unless magic is involved.</p>
