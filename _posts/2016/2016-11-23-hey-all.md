Hey all! A short, one time plug:<br />I&#39;ve started a series of &quot;3 Suggestions&quot; for all sorts of things I think are interesting, such as creating new ways for a bard to perform something other than songs; introducing personal cohorts to DW and giving them motivations; and some interesting inns, including custom moves.<br />More to follow in the future, and there are some more on <a href="http://dmsguild.com" class="ot-anchor">dmsguild.com</a>. Thanks!<br /><br /><a href="http://www.drivethrurpg.com/browse/pub/10343/Up-to-Four-Players" class="ot-anchor">http://www.drivethrurpg.com/browse/pub/10343/Up-to-Four-Players</a>
