John Wick, who did the &#39;Wicked Fantasy&#39; setting, has a new kickstarter. A 2nd edition of 7th Sea, possibly my favorite setting of all time. <br />7th Sea is inspired by the works of Alexandre Dumas, The Princess Bride, and other novels and movies of high adventure, and it played fast and furious, emulating the pace we&#39;ve come to expect from movies such as Captain Blood, The Three Musketeers, and Pirates of the Caribbean.<br /><br /><a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/johnwickpresents/7th-sea-second-edition" class="ot-anchor">https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/johnwickpresents/7th-sea-second-edition</a><br />
