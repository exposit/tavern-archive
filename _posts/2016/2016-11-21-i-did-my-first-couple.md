I did my first couple sessions of playtesting this weekend for two compendium classes in my upcoming supplement: Binding World. <br /><br />It went pretty well and I talk about the notes I took and changes I made in this post: <br /><a href="http://vindexus.net/2016/11/20/binding-world-update-3-playtesting-bloodbinder-and-medium/" class="ot-anchor">http://vindexus.net/2016/11/20/binding-world-update-3-playtesting-bloodbinder-and-medium/</a> <br /><br />Binding World site:  <a href="http://bindingworld.vindexus.net" class="ot-anchor">http://bindingworld.vindexus.net</a>

I recently finished two one-shot sessions of Dungeon World where I playtested the Bloodbinder and the Medium compendium classes from Binding World, my upcoming DW supplement. Using the software I wrote about in my previous post, I did up some quick character sheets before the first session.
