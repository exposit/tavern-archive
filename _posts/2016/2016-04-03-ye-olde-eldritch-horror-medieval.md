<b>Ye Olde Eldritch Horror</b><br /><br />Medieval murals meet H.P. Lovecraft monsters. Great visual aids for introducing them to your game.<br /><br /><a href="https://www.artstation.com/artwork/9Bxoy" class="ot-anchor">https://www.artstation.com/artwork/9Bxoy</a>

This is a series of illustrations that imitates the style of old medieval paintings and adds a macabre flavour by incorporating some of H.P. Lovecraft's famous monsters. The text is mostly medieval Middle High German.

        <p>paradoxically, the medieval residents would be less prone to dealing with sanity issues because monsters and demons exist within their accepted world paradigm.<br /><br />Heck the Cthulhu Mythos is pretty much an average pantheon for the ancient world.</p>
