So here are some new alignment related ways of earning XP to replace the originals.  They are useabke across all classes.  <br /><br />Good- teach (defeated?) villain the error of his ways in heart to heart talk and tell him of path to truth/justice/light/goodness.<br /><br />Evil.  Harm/kill those who help you and wish you well.<br /><br />Neutral.  Revenge yourself against those who harm you or reward those who aid you in degree which they deserve.<br /><br />Lawful.  Uphold/enforce the law system you believe in .<br /><br />Chaotic.  Cause contention or controversy or disorder in your party or among the people your around.<br /><br />P.S.  I think dungeon world is one of the best RPGS for creating characters or drama like that from your favorite movie or show due to how freeform and engaging the rulesystem is.  <br /><br /> ï»¿

        <p>One thing to consider when designing an alignment goal is what kind of story you want to encourage.  I&#39;d suggest trying to make the motives a bit more nuanced; the current wording will tend toward a highly polarized comical exaggeration of good and evil.  Which is fine if that&#39;s what you&#39;re after, but worth considering.</p>

        <p>Your right, I was thinking this would work in a shonen style setting or even basic dungeon world.  But it certainly would not work in all settings, such as stonetop, or a grittier, more realistic setting.</p>

        <p>Those are to specific. Alignments should be things that in theory could be done every session if they try to achieve it.<br /><br />Some of the alignments in the base games fall into that same problem (paladin&#39;s lawful) so in those cases I let character pick their own trigger for exp.</p>

        <p>I like your idea of letting players choose their alignment trigger.  Really helps you figure what your character tick.</p>
