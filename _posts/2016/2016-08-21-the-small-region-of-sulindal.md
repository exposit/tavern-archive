The small region of Sulindal has been in relative peace for over three centuries. The steadings of the region all worked with each other, one in particular, the dwarves of Smitheim defended the region from the horrors that creep from the depths of the Grytfell mountains. One of such horrors is Ugothos, it appeared long ago emerging from a meteorite that fell on the mountain near the area now known as the Grytt Crater. The dwarves managed to seal it then a few days back another meteorite fell which released Uguthos, the dwarves failed to seal him again and fearing the madness and corrupting Uguthos brought would spread through the water, they closed the dams they controlled which gave water to most of the steadings of the region. Its been now 5 days since the dams were closed and no one knows why. To make things worse, it hasn&#39;t rained a single inch either (even when magically induced) and wells are drying out one by one. The adventurers come into the region to investigate what is going on, discover the Uguthos danger, find a way to reseal the creature and save the region (and the world) from succumbing to its corruption.<br /><br />.<br /><br />This product contains A 59 page adventure for Dungeon World with<br /><br />One primary danger and two optional ones depending on what the characters do.<br />Four fleshed out steadings, each with their own map<br />Four dungeons and one optional dungeon. The important dungeons have their own maps<br />Character options including a new material for weapons and armor, dungeon gear, magic items related to the adventure, and two new types of hirelings
