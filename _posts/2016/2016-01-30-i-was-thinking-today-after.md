I was thinking today after watching the beginnings of a Dungeon World one shot that was GM&#39;d by <span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink" href="https://plus.google.com/112484087750169360510" oid="112484087750169360510">Adam Koebel</a></span>​​, that it would be cool to play a Bard whose talent and performance were in oratory and writing. Basically play him as a revolutionary, a town crier, and pamphleteer. ﻿

        <p>The bard in my current game plays as a motivational speaker. &quot;Trath! <i>Be a warrior, not a worrier! You WILL succeed, I can feel it</i>&quot;</p>

I would love to listen in on that. That fun is what I had in mind. That slight change could lead to some great play motivation (no pun intended).<br /><br />I was thinking of Bard almost as politician or social revolutionary. &quot;Brothers! Are we going to let the king&#39;s guard tell us where we can go? We are free men! Use your swords and exercise your FREEDOM!&quot; It would be so over the top and fun and, I think, less intimidating than playing the classic stereotypical singing Bard.</p>

        <p>I know this is weird, but I often think of The Mule from Isaac Asimov&#39;s <i>Foundation and Empire</i> when I think of a bard. I just love the idea of his weird instrument (a Visi-Sonor) and his subtle psychic influences. </p>

It&#39;s like playing an evangelical cleric that is earnest, but ineffective.</p>
