Happy Holidays everyone. Quick question that hasn&#39;t come up before in our group. Can elves or dwarves see better at night or low light conditions than say humans?

        <p>My understanding is per &quot;old school&quot; D&amp;D elves and dwarves have infravision as the basic Gygaxian default; unless your Dungeon World house rules differ. I don&#39;t think it is in the rulebook.</p>

        <p>This has come up here before and the answer is: Ask the players. DW doesn&#39;t make any assumptions about setting, and, as far as I know, this isn&#39;t mentioned one way or the other anywhere in the book.</p>

        <p>As above. It entirely depends on the player of the elf and the player of the dwarf what the races are capable of.</p>

        <p>This is a good opportunity to ask the players.<br />All Powered by the Apocalypse games (which DW is) use this table practice.<br />When you don&#39;t know, ask the players. There agreed answer becomes truth in the fiction for the ongoing campaign going forward.<br />Most players have a &quot;revelation&quot; moment the first time you fire one of these questions their way. üòÜ</p>

        <p>Ask questions and use the answers.</p>

        <p>In Dungeon World humans have dark hearing. They can hear in darkness as though it was broad daylight.</p>

        <p>It&#39;s never come up in our game. We all just assumed they needed light sources, so that&#39;s the world default. Of course, we&#39;ve never had a dwarf PC.<br /></p>
