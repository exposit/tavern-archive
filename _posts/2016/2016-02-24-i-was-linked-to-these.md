I was linked to these through the Lonewolf solo rpg community and thought, &#39;Hey! These would be great for  the Perilous Wilds!&#39;<br /><br />Great evocative descriptors, weather and tags aplenty.<br />The artwork is pretty OldSkool too.<br /><br />Once I get them into my hot little hands I&#39;m going to come up with a procedure for using them in conjuction with the &#39;making a map&#39; guidelines and the player moves in Perilous Journeys. This will be fun!

        <p>I like the adjective clouds and weather tables. I&#39;ve been making it a principle lately to always describe the weather.</p>

        <p>I&#39;m a little nonplussed by $20 for a single 54 card deck, BUT if it gets to 15-18k (and I think it will) the deck starts getting bigger, all the way up to 72. That&#39;s more of a value for $20. Though - does that just mean more repetition? And do you think the front-and-back images are the same?</p>

        <p>I dunno about these.  The illustrations don&#39;t look real evocative and the cards don&#39;t suggest a setting in motion, they don&#39;t suggest what&#39;s going on in the place, just what the place is. I want more verbs and fewer adjectives in the wordcloud. I do like the prominent placement of the weather tho.<br /><br /><span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink" href="https://plus.google.com/107200488853215420475" oid="107200488853215420475">Dirk Detweiler Leichty</a></span>&#39;s stuff is more to my liking.

        <p>Yeah John, Dirk&#39;s stuff is more evocative for sure! I&#39;m a great supporter of this stuff. He needs to do more PnP card decks :)<br /><br />The Submerged Sea Caves in particular are brilliant.</p>
