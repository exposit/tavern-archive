Hi, everyone! I&#39;m a novice Dungeon World GM, but I haven&#39;t let that stop me from thinking of how to make it more immersive and fun. To which end, I came up with a pretty simple food-centric expansion for the game (Note: I haven&#39;t tried it out in real play yet). I&#39;d appreciate constructive criticisms!

        <p>That&#39;s a lot of +1s in there... Can you come up with some more flavorful benefits to eating something besides the standard rations? (No pun intended.)</p>

        <p>Granted, +1 to a stat is kinda simple-minded, but its straightforwardness is its appeal, I think. It&#39;s pretty easy to track, and doesn&#39;t require too much in-fiction explaining.<br /><br />Of course, we can think up items that are useful in certain situations. For example, Ünderbrau is a drink that makes you more charismatic towards dwarves. Or pasta aglio e olio gives you +1 on close-combat actions against vampires. Or maybe dishes that allow timed access to metamagic tags, say Flash Newt Tarts which allow you to add blinding tags to your spells.</p>

        <p>Hmm, point taken. I thought that limiting the period of efficacy would offset it enough, but if you think it&#39;s too much, I&#39;ll take that into consideration. The fluid nature of time in DW can also make determining the periods somewhat complicated to determine.<br /><br />Of course, as GMs we can try throwing more dangers at the buffed PCs. :P</p>

        <p>DW gets its &quot;immersive&quot; feel from describing the fiction through back and forth conversation between the GM and player, not from tracking more mechanicical effects. That would have the opposite desired effect in game. <br /><br />Instead consider creating a list of questions that the GM can use/get inspired by. <br /><br />Heres a few ideas:<br /><br /> What is it about this stew that makes you think about your tribe in the whispering plains?<br /><br />How did you survive the cold nights in the War and what taste will you never forget?<br /><br />What smell makes you want to fall asleep near a fire with the sounds of friends and family in your ears?<br /><br />And so on...<br /></p>
