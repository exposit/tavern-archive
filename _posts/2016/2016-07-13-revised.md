        <p>I want this to be cool, but wording is poor. So bad, that I gave up on picking out what all seemed broken..<br /><br />&quot;bed of organic matter&quot; sounds too broad to offer a reward like extra healing. Suggest it is just that no rations are consumed in that situation<br /><br />Personal preference: can you spare us the singing mushroom minion (fungal minstrel)? a bit unfitting fictionally.. and just odd without some flavor text about it<br /><br />Underdark Adapted: sounds like a license to kill anything if you can get it in a cave (at least, for those who would take it..). Don&#39;t like that it removes drama from a situation of drama (hiding)<br /><br />Fungal Healing: how many times a day? this functions as infinity-heal without a limit. Why do I even need the mushie cave if I can spray spores that heal <b>and</b> I can target myself</p>

It is why I post on the site. This is a small revision to a much worked over CC from a year ago, which the Tavern at the time loved. Fungal Healing acts as the Clerical spell, as stated.</p>

        <p>Please spare me the guilt trip for the feedback I provided. I didn&#39;t just say &quot;it sucks&quot; and walk away.<br /><br />Forgive me for pointing out flaws in the design (or Don&#39;t, I guess- it was admittedly candid). However, if I can&#39;t get through it even though I like your class, I figure I <i>owe</i> it to you to explain and to be honest</p>

These are drafts and I try to have a thick skin, but first time posters might be discouraged by too much &quot;candor&quot;. We are a community and should try to support as well as improve our members creations.</p>
