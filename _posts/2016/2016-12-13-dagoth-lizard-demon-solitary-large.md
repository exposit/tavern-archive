<br />Dagoth (Lizard demon)	Solitary, Large, Planar<br />Talons (d12+4 damage)	16 HP,	1 armor<br />Forceful<br />Special Qualities: Reverts to statue if horn removed, Only damaged by magic or magical weapons, immune from harm as a statute or horn<br /><br />Dagoth, also referred to as the Dreaming God, was a demon worshipped by the people of Shadizar, particularly Queen Taramis. He participated in a large battle with other evil beings, during which his source of power, a jeweled horn, was broken off. Dagoth fell to Earth in a weakened state and his body turned into stone, becoming a statue. As written in the ancient Scrolls of Skelos, if the horn were found placed in the forehead of the statue, it would bring about the evil god&#39;s resurrection, and as long as a virgin girl was sacrificed at the hour of the god&#39;s rebirth (in this case, Taramis&#39; niece Jehnna), everything would be fine. Legend holds that Dagoth will grant any wish his restorer desires, but great care should be used in the exact words used for the wish. Unfortunately, the ritual was interrupted by Conan and his companions and Taramis&#39; vizier speared by Zula before he could sacrifice Jehnna, and the end result of this is that Dagoth became angered and transformed into a monstrous, lizard-like beast. The wizard Akiro deduced that Dagoth&#39;s horn was his life, and in tearing the horn from the ex-god&#39;s forehead, returned Dagoth to his statute form. Later both horn and statue vanished from Shalizar in different eras. Scholars speculate that Dagoth may be related to the ancient evil Zargon in some fashion.<br /><br />Instinct: Destroy<br /><br />Rage monster<br />Demon of the Ancient World<br />Pefers Conan the Barbarian movie
