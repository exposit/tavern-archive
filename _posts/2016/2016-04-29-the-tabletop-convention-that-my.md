The tabletop convention that my friend and I are attempting to host has a kickstarter that is going live in two days! I would ask that you all please share this in your respective groups and help to make this happen for our area! Thank you so much everyone!<br /><br /><a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/807705075/1818150275?token=12a607d0" class="ot-anchor">https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/807705075/1818150275?token=12a607d0</a>
