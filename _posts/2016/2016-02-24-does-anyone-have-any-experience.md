Does anyone have any experience with Hardholder-like playbooks? Specifically, playbooks that deal with the steading rules and give a home base like the Landed Gentry CC? How do they work in play?

        <p>Or stuff possibly borrowed from A Dark Age (or whatever the pre- AW 2e playtest was) ?</p>

        <p>I&#39;m not so sure DW is very good at telling that kind of story. The goals of DW are by my reading:<br />1. Explore interesting places<br />2. Kill monsters<br />3. Take their stuff<br /><br />Why wouldn&#39;t you just play AW if you want to run a village?</p>

        <p>There&#39;s a Landed Gentry compendium class out there. That&#39;s pretty close.<br /><br />And last I checked, what DW is good at is:<br />1. Portray a fantastic world<br />2. Fill the characters’ lives with adventure<br />3. Play to find out what happens<br /><br />That absolutely works within a town. Just remember: the town is also a dungeon!</p>

        <p>I don&#39;t have any play experience with anything like the Landed Gentry or the Merchant or any of those other location/enterprise based CCs. I assume <span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink" href="https://plus.google.com/113864117304127544117" oid="113864117304127544117">Johnstone Metzger</a></span> has some experience.<br /><br />Stonetop isn&#39;t quite the same thing, but it&#39;s got some inspiration from those classes, sure. The Landed Gentry, for example, makes the demense of one PC central to a character, which can in turn make that character and their demense central to the campaign.  A natural extension is to have Fronts and Dangers that threaten the demense, and use the start-of-session rolls as adventure/situation generators.  That&#39;s a pretty core part of what I want the Steading moves &amp; playbook to do in Stonetop.  </p>

        <p>You just have to make sure the connection between PC and setting is an element of play. Kind of like Signature Weapon: the mechanical rules part is fairly minimal, but if you treat it like a significant part of the fiction, you can get a lot of mileage out of it.<br /><br />If you want a game where PCs are constantly on the move, though, it&#39;s kind of a waste. DW supports a wandering dungeoncrawl party, sure, but it also rewards persistent relationships between PCs and NPCs and setting elements.</p>

        <p>Yes, Hardholders do add a lot to the world right off the bat. The hardhold definitely needs to be a source of trouble for PCs to get into.</p>
