Monster stat question. How would you indicate a monster is immune to non-magical weapons? Would you ever do such a thing? (Is it within the spirit of DW? Has it been done before?) I have a specific instance of dwarf-made gargoyle guardians to which your answers might apply. :)

        <p>What is the narrative reason for this? Do you want only PCs with magic weapons to be able to hurt it? If so, <i>why</i>?</p>

        <p>Maybe &quot;ignore mundane weapons&quot; as a move?</p>

        <p>Just say so. <br /><br />We already know that you don&#39;t get to roll hack &amp; slash against a dragon when all you&#39;ve got is a tiny regular sword. This isn&#39;t much different.</p>

        <p>Yeah, the old D&amp;D reason for that sort of thing was about making the monster arbitrarily more difficult. That doesn&#39;t fit Dungeon World. <br /><br />However, sometimes the idea was to make the monster more scary, and that can be a narrative goal. So, if that&#39;s what you want, the question is, is there anything you can do with these guys to make them more scary that isn&#39;t just immune to normal weapons? <br /><br />For example, maybe if normal weapons are used, on a miss they break, or invoke a move where they <i>may</i> break. Volleys do less damage unless, say,  you&#39;re using a stone rather than an arrow.<br /><br />Heck, I would think that dwarf-made guardians would want to <i>steal</i> and store foreign magic weapons for later analysis. </p>

        <p>Narratively, it makes sense to me that mundane iron weapons would be very hard to use against a creature of stone. But ... well I guess that&#39;s what picks are for anyway. I will probably leave it at high armor unless I think the dwarves worked a special protection into the constructs. THANKS ALL!</p>
