Anyone have success with this technique?Â <br /><br />I&#39;ve found it works pretty well with experienced players and a clear setup I provide along with input ( treasure in a tomb, traps, guardian monster and diary of a failed expedition for example). It&#39;s also important come up with good GM revisions!

        <p>When you spend time swapping tales and sorting through information about a dangerous place you have yet to explore, name a place you want to know more about, then spend 0-3 preparation and roll+preparation spent. *On a hit, choose one from the list and tell us how you get it. *On a 7-9, your information will be slightly off, out of date, or incomplete when you try to use it.<br />Â·Â Â Â Â Â Â  You acquire part of a map, draw it out or otherwise present it to the group.<br />Â·Â Â Â Â Â Â  You learn of a trap or similar hazard, describe it. When you encounter it, take +1 forward.<br />Â·Â Â Â Â Â Â  You learn of a valuable treasure, describe it and where itâ€™s kept.<br />Â·Â Â Â Â Â Â  You learn of a dangerous enemy or group in the area, describe and/or name them. When you encounter them, take +1 forward.<br />Â·Â Â Â Â Â Â  You learn something useful about the areaâ€™s history, layout, or politics, tell us what.<br />Â·Â Â Â Â Â Â  You acquire something that will be particularly useful in there (a key, a password, etc.), tell us what you got.<br />*On a 6-, choose one anyway, but donâ€™t describe it yet. Instead, ask the GM what it will cost you to gain that knowledge, and even then what you get will be slightly off, out of date, or incomplete when you try to use it.<br />Â <br />Examples:<br />&quot;Hey, isn&#39;t there supposed to be a passage here? It&#39;s on the map...&quot;<br />Â <br />&quot;That trap? Oh, it wasn&#39;t a sliding blade, it&#39;s an alarm. You hear a growl coming from deeper within the dungeon.&quot;<br />Â <br />&quot;Oh yes, there&#39;s ogres. They&#39;re servants of the demon that&#39;s taken up residence deeper inside.&quot;<br />Â <br />&quot;Why yes, this is the tomb of the ancient king Dalboz. Did you remember to wear his colors so his undead servants wouldn&#39;t think you&#39;re tomb robbers and attack you?&quot;<br />Â <br />&quot;Here&#39;s the secret door, right where the guy in the tavern said it would be. Anyone got the key? Because it&#39;s locked.&quot;</p>

        <p>I&#39;ve done this twice in a D&amp;D5e game, just not to build a dungeon.Â  Once was having them research the journey to a lost temple.Â  The other was researching the dwarven kingdom, since none of them had been there.Â  Both went very well, but you have to be comfortable with improv GMing and be able to connect dots in weird ways.</p>

        <p>I rarely, rarely do &quot;dungeons&quot;. Â I have to, within the context of the game, really come up with a logical reason for a dungeon to exist. Â And I&#39;m picky, it ain&#39;t easy to convince myself; &#39;yeah, this is a good place for a dungeon.&quot;. Â <br />It the 2nd episode of the Intrigues of Parsantium; I had a semi-dungeon... it was one natural cave room. Â That&#39;s it. Â I&#39;ve done crypts and catacombs and caves and towers.. but a full blown dungeon as in something from D&amp;D modules past? Â Haven&#39;t done it in years. Â <br /><br />Having said that, I&#39;ve used the technique, without the dice, a lot in setting up situations that drive adventures. Â Asking the players for their spin on things really helps. Â Often, on Spout Lore, if I can&#39;t come up with something, I will ask them what they think would be cool. Â The table has input.<br /><br />But having a tangible reward might be an interesting graft onto DW. Â Let me think about that a little bit. Â </p>

        <p>This does feel like a Spout Lore, but with Player input rather than GM say-so.<br /><br />Very interesting, curious to see how this might work in a Hex Crawlï»¿<br /><br />P.s.<br />How do you gain/restore Preparation?</p>

        <p>I guess the move is a Specific-Beats-General, as Bolster is designed to only add one per roll to things with a mod. Cool.</p>
