I&#39;m going to start posting some moves I&#39;ve formulated since getting into DW (but haven&#39;t used in play yet) one by one, for inspiration and/or critique.<br /><br /><i>Symbel</i><br />When you <b>get very drunk with the Oathkeepers</b>, Roll+CON.<br />* On a 10+ You swear a ridiculous oath, but fulfilled it that night! Describe it, and get +1 ongoing to CHA to rolls relevant to Oathkeeper steadings or Hirelings.<br />* On a 7-9 You&#39;ve sworn an oath that the GM will describe, and if you return to the Oathkeepers with proof, they will herald you as a hero! <br />* On a 6- You made an oath you can&#39;t keep; describe it, and suffer -1 ongoing to CHA to rolls relevant to Oathkeeper steadings or Hirelings.

        <p>I think the 6- should be left up to the GM. I think there&#39;s way more fun to be had there than just a -1. What if you made a promise you can&#39;t remember, or if you fulfill a promise that&#39;s left you with powerful enemies?</p>

        <p>That&#39;s pretty cool. I&#39;m curious what kind of ridiculous oath you could fulfill in a night, unless you mean ridiculous as &quot;silly&quot; and not as &quot;hard to do.&quot;<br /><br />There&#39;s some minor grammar stuff you could fix up. On 10+ you should probably have &quot;you swore&quot; to keep the verb tense consistent. The 7-9 result should probably read &quot;return with proof <b>*of its completion*</b>&quot; or &quot;return with proof <b>*you&#39;ve upheld it*</b>&quot; otherwise it reads like you&#39;re returning with proof that you&#39;ve sworn an oath. You also don&#39;t need to capitalize the &quot;you&quot; after the roll result.<br /><br />What I like about this is that it&#39;s closely tied to steadings and hirelings of a specific type. Steadings are something I don&#39;t use nearly enough, so this might be a way for me to integrate them more.<br /><br />I also agree with Oli on leaving something up to the GM on the 6-. The -1 ongoing is a relevant mechanic that fits the fiction, so I&#39;d probably keep that, but leave the rest a bit more open ended to give the GM more wiggle room.<br /><br />Cool stuff, keep em coming!</p>
