Here is another simple CC move. Great for any spell user. <a rel="nofollow" class="ot-hashtag" href="https://plus.google.com/s/%23DungeonWorldCC/posts">#DungeonWorldCC</a><br /><br /><b>Scribe</b><br /><i>When you have time to sit and write down a spell you know/prepared and empower your words with magical energy onto a blank piece of parchment,</i> Roll+INT and forget the spell until you make camp.<br />10+, The scroll is complete<br />7-9, choose one:<br />-The magic within the parchment won&#39;t last the day<br />-The spell contains unforeseen consequences (GM will tell you how when the scroll is used)<br />-Making the scroll has drained you more than expected. Forget an additional spell until you make camp.ï»¿

        <p>I do have a question for you all.<br /><br />How does one properly use Scrolls?<br /><br />Let me be more specific. <br />-Which characters can use Scrolls?<br />-How does one use it?<br />-Are Rolls needed?<br />-if Rolls are needed, how do you handle anything but a 10+?<br /><br />The rules are a bit vague and I&#39;ve house ruled it to let anyone use a scroll without the need to roll, but I would like to know what the &quot;proper&quot; way to use a Scroll is</p>

        <p>What if they roll a 7-9?</p>

        <p>Very nice move! <br /><br />For the scroll, the book says if the spell is in your class spell list you read it and the spell is cast. Don&#39;t think you should roll anything as per raw.</p>

        <p>That&#39;s a really awesome move. I&#39;d change &quot;lose&quot; to &quot;forget&quot; just to fit the rest of the book, but that&#39;s it.<br /><br />To your other questions, I let anyone use scrolls and I don&#39;t require a roll for it. It might take a moment to read the scroll or get into position, which might trigger a Defy Danger.</p>

        <p>Interesting. It seems that, though the mighty creators tried to keep it simple, everyone reads it differently.<br /><br /><span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink" href="https://plus.google.com/108720310977863955899" oid="108720310977863955899">Stephen Karnes</a></span>â€‹, that makes allot of sense in favor of those who roll for the use of a scroll. I will have to bring this up with my group and see how they like it.<br /><br />And thank you everyone who likes the move. I thought it was pretty cool myself ðŸ˜Ž<br /><span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink" href="https://plus.google.com/102166660006024670653" oid="102166660006024670653">Colin Kierans</a></span>â€‹, I&#39;m change the wording, I like yours better.</p>
