<b>When you dive for cover</b> roll+DEX<br />On a 10+ you make it safe &amp; sound.<br />On a 7-9 pick one<br />-You act hastily and leave something important out in the open<br />-You misjudged and have left some part of yourself exposed<br />-Anyone watching this thinks you&#39;re a coward

        <p><b>When you Squeeze into a space much too small for you</b> roll+DEX<br />10+ Success! You just barely fit<br />7-9 You fit but, pick one<br />-&gt; You&#39;re Stuck<br />-&gt; You had to leave something valuable behind to make room<br /><del>&gt; You broke/Damaged what ever it was you tried to squeeze between (GM must find this choice fitting of the fiction)ï»¿</del><br /><br />Edit: on second thought, didn&#39;t care for that last choice</p>

        <p>Maybe &quot;something ends up broken, damaged or left behind&quot;? That way you can break fragile items or abandon them to fit through a tight crevasse, or even leave a trail of angry, bruised people behind as you shove through a crowd</p>

        <p>I like it. The additional specificity clarifies the clunkier parts of Defy Danger, and prevents it from being the &quot;catch all&quot; move.</p>
