Has anyone used something like this in their games? Not strictly DW.<br /><br />These are proto-types and took less than 5min. I like being able to portray what I see in my head to those at the table quickly. I also find 3d props to work very well. This, I think, can show important features of a room or scene. Maybe whiped up during a snack break, or prepared for fronts already discussed﻿

        <p>That&#39;s a really cool idea; you could maybe even sketch a bunch of rough, generic rooms and have a folder full of them for whatever situation pops up. Although, since the entire table probably can&#39;t see it in detail at once, I&#39;m not sure I&#39;d find it as useful as a flat map.<br /><br />Additional idea, though: since the bottom has two overlapping layers, it&#39;d be a neat way to model a hidden trapdoor or whatnot; just switch which flap is on top if they discover something. I feel there is more to be done with that idea, but it would be more prop work than I&#39;d really be into.</p>

        <p>Yes, a bit more prep. My hope is to have a bunch of pre-cut and ready to sketch paper. I&#39;ll see how it turns out at my next game.</p>

        <p>No, but I am reminded of a group in Melbourne that just started a live action heist game that was crowd funded (if you&#39;re ever in Oz) - <a href="https://www.smalltimecriminals.com/the-game/" class="ot-anchor">https://www.smalltimecriminals.com/the-game/</a></p>

        <p>This is such a great idea! <br /><br />Aaron--I also remember seeing something like this, too, but just on the internet. Though I did talk about &quot;doll housing&quot; once upon a time, that was just talking about things that happen in play. Wish I could remember the other context!</p>

        <p>There was a conversation about paper-folding dungeons a while back. I have some pretty complex models with multiple rooms and towers and stuff, but haven&#39;t done much with them.</p>

        <p>Found one of my posts:<br /><br />Inspired by Liz C. and Ray Otus, here&#39;s the template for an asymmetric dungeon with a tower on one side. Up-folds on the dotted lines, down-folds on the dashed lines, and cut the unbroken lines. (The central part threads through the tower).<br /><a href="https://corvidsun.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/tower.pdf" class="ot-anchor">https://corvidsun.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/tower.pdf</a></p>

        <p>You could make these a bit more resilient (and make sturdy large rooms) by cutting the corners out of cardboard boxes with a box cutter. A quick application of spray paint on the outside could mask any branding and make them stone or brick or wood.</p>

        <p>I like the cereal box idea. Definitely would be needed prepared before hand though with that.<br /><br />Love the tower foldable! Can&#39;t wait to try it</p>
