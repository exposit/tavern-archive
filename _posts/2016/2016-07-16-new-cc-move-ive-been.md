New CC move<br />Ive been watching alot of Kung fu panda with my young daughter...like A LOT of panda.<br /><br />So i thought of a CC move that uses Chi.<br /><br /><i>Chi Mastery</i><br /><b>When you focus your inner power</b> Roll+WIS. On a 10+ hold 3, 7-9 hold 2 and the GM will give you a complication. Spend holds to:<br />-&gt; Heal anothers wounds equal to your CON<br />-&gt; Provide another a +1 forward<br />-&gt; Increase anothers power. +2 damage<br />-&gt; Steal anothers Chi equal to your CON. Reduce their HP by that much and increase yours by an equal amount.<br />-&gt; Steal Chi from another equal to your CON. Reduce their HP by that much and gain +1 damage.<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" class="ot-hashtag" href="https://plus.google.com/s/%23DungeonWorldCC/posts">#DungeonWorldCC</a>

        <p>This might be a good spot for a &quot;on a 6- hold 1&quot; too, but otherwise I like it - assuming &quot;equal to your CON&quot; means the bonus and not the value</p>

        <p>I&#39;d recommend fictioning it up a little.  Like, <i>how</i> do you provide another +1 forward?  <i>How</i> do you increase another&#39;s power?<br /><br />I know you can ask the player &quot;what does that look like,&quot; but I find that to be weaksauce. It&#39;s too easy to <i>not</i> ask that question, and that leads to a purely mechanical output from the move.<br /><br />Also: in what circumstances and how often do you expect that this chi-master will channel their chi?  Like, does it take just a few moments and they&#39;ll do it whenever they run out?  If so, the mechanic works well as it is. Though I might add something to the trigger like &quot;when you <i>take a few moments to</i> channel your chi.&quot; And maybe a condition, like &quot;if you break your taboo, you lose all chi.&quot; <br /><br />On the other hand, if you picture this as something like preparing spells, something that takes an hour or so to do, then there shouldn&#39;t be a roll.  They should just get X chi and then spend it as needed.  <br /><br />Hmm... this is starting to veer away from your original vision, but I could imagine a version where you hold X chi and then spend it to <i>augment other moves</i>.  Like, spend 1 chi...<br /><br />...when you roll 10+ to hack &amp; slash: strike a nerve, causing them to stagger in pain for a moments<br /><br />...in lieu of 1 hold from Defend, to intercept an attack and redirect it harmlessly into the ground or some other part of the scenery<br /><br />...when you would Defy Danger with DEX; don&#39;t roll; you move with sublime grace as if you rolled a 12+.<br /><br />etc.</p>

        <p>Added flavor fiction text.<br /><br />“We all contain a power within ourselves greater than most understand. I will teach you how to harness that power to change the world around you.”<br />-Chi Master Chang<br /><br /><i>Chi Mastery</i><br />You can feel your Chi building inside you. You have the ability to release it as a daziling light in order to change the world. <b>When you spend just a moment to concentrate on your inner power</b>, Roll+WIS. On a 10+ hold 3, 7-9 hold 2 and the GM will explain a complication. Spend holds to:<br />-&gt; Transfer your power to another and heal them equal to your CON.<br />-&gt; Your Chi enhances anothers concentration and reflexs. They take +1 forward.<br />-&gt; Another’s body pullses with power. They receive +2 damage foward<br /><br /><i>Stealing another&#39;s power is against the flow of the universe and taboo amongst Chi Masters. You can spend your holds to do the following, but you receive -1 ongoing (cumulative) to Chi Mastery until you rest and contemplate your actions.</i><br /><br />-&gt; Sap the energy from another and reduce their health by an amount equal to your CON. You heal an equal amount.<br />-&gt; Another&#39;s power is transfered into yourself. Reduce their health by an amount equal to your CON. You gain +2 damage forward.</p>

        <p>I like the negative Chi stealing effect.</p>
