Has anyone done a gonzo &quot;every playbooks&quot; DW game? With the wealth of them available it&#39;s bound to create a unique party of adventurers for sure. I&#39;m  curious to hear your weird/gonzo party composition stories.

        <p>I&#39;ve run a &quot;monster mash&quot; of all monster playbooks. Ghoul, spider, skeleton looking for their stolen treasure.</p>

        <p>I ran one with Cursed Armor, Nephilim, a Psionicist, and a couple other classes. I ran then through Lost Caverns of Tsojcanth.<br /><br />Much fun was had by all.</p>

        <p>I usually allow just about any legitimately completed playbook. I like to see the variety.</p>

        <p>My worlds tend to be pretty high fantasy, so I tend not to restrict playbooks. Currently we have a game going that has a Technician, Fighter, Brawler, Gunslinger, Alchemist and Orc. This new setting is sci-fantasy though, otherwise I wouldn&#39;t have the technician in there.</p>

        <p>I allow most playbooks, but I give them a read through first. Some are just too badly written to roll with for one reason or another.<br /><br />I usually get more unusual races than classes. I ran a short lived campaign where we played a game of Dawn of Worlds to make the setting first, and if I remember right we had a kobold Fighter, a sentient gorilla Artificer and a scorpion centaur-ish thing Barbarian.</p>
