Scale can escalate the severity of the threat quick. I remember someone here suggesting location based moves for fighting really big opposition piece by piece in DW. Also, I know Iron Edda: World hinges on the conceit of fantastic kaiju as well, but I have only skimmed the material. Besides, with the wizard&#39;s Ritual move, and the paladin&#39;s Quest immunities, with some forethought a DW party can come packing some pretty serious giant slaying gear.﻿

        <p>Seeing some moves against giants would be cool. I once had a dinosaur in an arena (long story) fight against the party. It had the move, hard to reach parts, and shrugged off 7-9 damage when it used that move unless the characters had fictionally positioned themselves to advantage, like attacking from a mount or climbing up on its back. But I would love to see something from the player perspective, &quot;When you attack the giant&#39;s leg...&quot; etc.</p>

        <p>PS I think you meant <a rel="nofollow" class="ot-hashtag" href="https://plus.google.com/s/%23rpgkaiju/posts">#rpgkaiju</a>, if you are relating this post to the question I asked earlier.</p>

        <p>To tell a good bit of the story in a single run-on sentence: he was &quot;The Relic,&quot; a creature from another time and place who had wandered into this world as a baby, through a magic mirror in the basement of a palace in an ancient city that had been abandoned by its architects and is now inhabited by a race of sentient apes. :) The druid didn&#39;t think to even ask about studying it for the purpose of shape-changing. I put a cap on the size of shape-shifts anyway. Rat to Rhino is my rough range. I put in that limitation after having a druid pull this stunt one too many times - turn into a bird, fly over the villain, shift into narwhal form, and drop. I made him take a good deal of damage because whales aren&#39;t mean to be on land, they can suffocate from their own weight, but still. Another decent limitation I have considered is that you can&#39;t shift from one animal to another, you have to return to human form in between.</p>

        <p>Ouch broken ribs- whales don&#39;t bounce.</p>
