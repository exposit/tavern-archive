I had an idea to come back to the Villager playbook and buff it up a little. I wanted something that was more capable of a real adventure than a squishy Villager, but I still wanted the “level zero” experience and the opportunity to shape the character’s story through play.<br /><br />There’s still a few more options that I would like to fill in for Destiny, and I can’t decide on a cool icon. Any thoughts?

        <p>I&#39;ll think on it. I like the idea and the Destiny move.</p>

        <p>This is really fantastic. I love the idea of starting as nothing and becoming something. I look forward to running a game with this as a started once you finish it.</p>

        <p>cool. i suggest you to modify the  wording of the first move, so that the player can have a better track of the unassigned scores.<br /><br />Maybe just assign this scores: +2, +1, +1, 0,- 1, - 1.<br /><br />That way, when a score is assigned, the player can just slash the number,<br /></p>
