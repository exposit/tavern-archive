I think my players are starting to learn how they can make things interesting when I ask them questions.  They found one part of what it takes to close a demonic portal and I asked them what two other things are required.  They said &quot;the heart of someone who has committed an act of violence&quot; and &quot;faerie dust&quot;.  I guess they don&#39;t want to make it easy on themselves. :D
