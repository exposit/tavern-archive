Thanks to everyone who reviewed my compendium classes :) I will be making them available to my players on Monday and will be posting the results here as to how they go. Feel free to add any more comments or ideas!<br /><br />The Way of Darkness - Void based class for thieves who wish to become silent assassins<br /><br />The Way of the Shadows - Shadow based class for theives who want to be sneaky while being out in the open.<br /><br />Champion of Scorpio - Dueling based class for clerics who like smashing things.<br /><br /><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lJctY0N3AeoiKqTvFe-qBwD29FTwRymllgqGqaOZOdA" class="ot-anchor">https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lJctY0N3AeoiKqTvFe-qBwD29FTwRymllgqGqaOZOdA</a><br /><br />
