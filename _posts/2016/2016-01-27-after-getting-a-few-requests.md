After getting a few requests, <span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink" href="https://plus.google.com/104623400813415689503" oid="104623400813415689503">Melissa Fisher</a></span> and I are considering making a physical book of all of our current classes, plus all of our class-making advice, <i>plus</i> a new class that we design as we go to show you how we do it in more detail.<br /><br />Problem is, just our classes would eat up some 480+ pages. Throw in another class and advice, and you&#39;re looking at around something over 500 pages.<br /><br />Going through DriveThru, printing a B&amp;W softcover is going to be $14.50. Add this to the cost of our All of the Playbooks bundle (which discounts everything by 50 cents), and you&#39;re looking at roughly <b>$57</b>, or about $62 when you account for shipping.<br /><br />If you want it in color and/or hardcover, that&#39;s going to be even more.<br /><br />Now, <i>even</i> if we shaved a dollar off of all of the classes, that&#39;d <i>still</i> end up running around <b>$45</b> <i>just</i> for a B&amp;W softcover (and our playbooks already offer more than virtually everyone else, while <i>still</i> costing the same or less).<br /><br />So, my question is whether this sounds like something you&#39;d want. What&#39;s the absolute most you&#39;d want to spend on a fully illustrated (and full-color), 500+ page book with 22 classes (and all the individual pdfs on the side), advice on creating classes, <i>and</i> an example class exclusive to the book?<br /><br />Would you prefer that we break it up into a series of smaller, thematic books (undead, rogues, &quot;normal&quot; adventurers, etc) to make it more affordable (and/or make it easier to only get the classes you really want)? Any other ideas?<br /><br />The idea is to charge you only what DriveThru would to print the book, while <i>still</i> allowing us to maintain a similar profit margin: we&#39;re not looking to milk anymore money than we already do from class sales.<br /><br />(I should note that anyone who has already purchased our <i>All of the Playbooks</i> bundle would get a print-at-cost link. People that have purchased other bundles from us would receive discounts based on how much the bundles cost.)<br /><br /> <a rel="nofollow" class="ot-hashtag" href="https://plus.google.com/s/%23dungeonworld/posts">#dungeonworld</a>

        <p>the hard part is justifying this purchase after buying so many of the mentioned classes<br /><br />maybe better doing the book without the classes (smaller + more focused) and giving a discount code for the classes? or something<br /><br />cheaper book<br />no double purchase<br />incentive to go buy the classes youve not got (as you have a discount code)</p>

        <p>Anyone who has all our classes already would be able to get a &quot;at print cost&quot; of the book.</p>
