        <p>So it&#39;s like resurrection, but in a cream form? I immediately thought it was just cosmetic. I had a Lich who was crazy (obviously) and only wanted to be known as the world&#39;s greatest magician in the circus where he worked. He would make himself look like a living person for his shows. I like the idea of him applying this in his makeup room before he goes on lol</p>

        <p>Ahahah nice Scott.<br /><br />To clarify, yes it is essentially resurrection. Just in a funny way of doing it. Maybe instead of finding the secret society of magician and clerics like is in 90% of all campaigns. Its found with a sly, smooth talking salesman.<br /><br />But they do need to be Undead. Not just Dead</p>

        <p>Ah, I see. Sounds like it could be used as leverage with intelligent undead when you try to Parley with them. At least it could in my games lol</p>
