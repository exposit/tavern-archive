I seem to remember a while ago i saw a class that had a summoning-esque move that went something along the lines of <b>&quot;Name one thing it is and one thing it isn&#39;t... On a Miss, it either is what you said it isn&#39;t or it isn&#39;t what you said it is&quot;</b> or something like that.<br /><br />Unfortunately, i am unable to find it where i&#39;ve looked so far (Grim World, Inverse World, Class Warfare, and War&amp;Wonders), so if anyone has any idea as to which class it came from, and/or the actual move text, could you please let me know? I loved the flavor that the move brought, and i&#39;m trying to base another move off of that same creation style, but i&#39;d like to get the original content right.

        <p>I&#39;m 90% sure you&#39;re thinking of the &quot;From Beyond the Black Gate&quot; move, which is in Class Warfare under the Conjurer specialty.</p>
