I occasionally consider throwing together a little DW supplement called <b>Drowning, Falling, and Starving to Death</b>. <br /><br />It&#39;d be nothing but custom moves for, well, yeah.  That sort of thing.  Y&#39;know, situations that come up often enough that it&#39;d be nice to have a move ready for it, but not something that you really <i>need</i> official moves for it. <br /><br />Heck, there might be 2-3 versions of moves for similar situations, reflecting different tones, or levels of danger/difficulty, specific circumstances, etc. Probably some design thoughts on each one.<br /><br />I got TOO MUCH TO DO to really give this much attention right now, but... any interest in such a thing?

        <p>I think that I would rather let the roleplaying dictate this.¬† Also, what&#39;s wrong with the normal Defy Danger.¬† Drowning: Defy Danger- roll+Str, Falling: Defy Danger- roll+Dex or if a good fiction is made roll+Con to resist the damage, roll+Dex for acrobatically catching yourself, ect.¬† Starving To Death: Defy Danger (or would it be Dangerous Journey): Fiction could dictate a roll+Int or roll+Wis for finding food in the wilderness, or roll+Con for resisting wasting away.¬† There are many ways you could handle this.¬† No need for all the custom Moves, let the fiction flow.</p>

        <p>I would find this really entertaining to read. Just to see additional ideas and fun things that could happen. It&#39;s a really interesting part of the game that is touched on quite little in supplements.</p>

        <p>Don&#39;t forget thirst. Kills you a lot faster than starvation. I wrote a custom fatigue recovery move for my Tekumel adaption where a 7-9 required food / drink to recover fatigue.</p>

        <p>I&#39;m against adding more rules to a system that thrives without them... However, some campaigns do benefit from a bit more flavour. My own needed a Move for when players return to the table after a while. I think if the Moves were strongly written to add a new dimension to a campaign and not just reskins of existing Moves it would be useful.</p>

        <p>There is allot that can be said for the &quot;Defy Danger for all&quot;. Heck, World of Dungeons plays very well with one move. However, I like having fun with moves and experimenting with things like this. There is no requirement to use them in your games, but no harm in doing a little mind experimenting eitherÔªø<br /><br />I&#39;d like to see some. If you want, I&#39;m sure the comunity could help with posts in a thread</p>

        <p>IMO, a more useful tool would be examples of GM responses/hard moves¬†for typical dangers and failures.¬† Bulleted examples of those typical situations, and the types of hard moves or progressions that could evolve.¬† Not ad infinitum, of course.¬†</p>

I find those harder to come up with on the fly than soft or hard moves on a miss, frankly.  The distinction between a hard bargain and an ugly choice is also something that I find hard to keep straight.</p>
