Daniel (Bryce) has already applied for this one as well. (2) slots are open for players of previous campaigns of mine.</p>

        <p>I&#39;m curious about opponents triggering hack and slash as well as players. I&#39;ve seen this used before, do you feel like it improves play?</p>

Which is why its healthy to note it right off the back. Sure theirs defy danger and the hack and slash which lets the monster hit you back, but I think after getting a 10+ on HnS, that ugly orc should be able to punch some holes back regardless and if he happens to get a 7-9 as well, then hey, now you got two attacks in.</p>

        <p>Do you stat all your monsters, or just give them a static 2d6?</p>

        <p>Static. (2d6+X) based on the monsters threats. Up to 5 for attacks that should not miss. Like a Dragon&#39;s breath swooping over an open field. The standard is +1, with veterans and experienced creatures having up to +3 or 4 if they are alone and powerful. <br /><br /></p>

        <p>Interesting- do you feel like it builds more of a black company type/ call of cthulhu fragile party? Curious to see how it plays out.</p>

        <p>Yes, it brings the party more on edge. Though to sort of balance things out (Still Fragile). My players with the custom playbooks. Have higher Base Hit Points then standard dungeon world. This way they can do impressive damage themselves as well as take 2-3 impressive hits. (Example: The most fragile class in this hack would hit max hit points of least 30, where as something standard DW like wizard would max at like 22; if they actually invest in con).</p>
