Running Legacy of the Shard with DW, and I offered the Cleric (who&#39;d spectacularly made his Deaths Door roll last session) the advanced move &quot;Chosen of Ilmater&quot;. -  you can shoulder the pain of the world. Gain 6 hit points and when you lay on hands an injured or wounded character, you can transfer as much of their damage onto yourself as you can bear.

        <p>Hmmm....that seems really powerful for when he is NOT laying on hands... he is walking around with some serious HP upgrade there.  Or is the 6 HP temporary and will fade after the next rest up? <br /><br />I suggest that the Chosen gets +1d6 Hit Points upon Laying Hands, but the amount of hit points healed/taken must be determined before the die roll.  </p>

        <p>He&#39;s got very few hit points and I tend to roll well for Monster damage, so it makes sense in context. Basically its one more hit with a d8 weapon that the party could take.   I was tempted with more a Mortal Shield approach (from the Malazan books) but HP is easier to do mechanically.</p>
