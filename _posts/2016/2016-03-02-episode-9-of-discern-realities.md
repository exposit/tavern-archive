        <p>I just back to backed all 9 episodes, wish they were a bit longer, but I really like the content and format.  Its cool that some Houston area gamers are putting stuff like this out.</p>

        <p>Thank you all for listening! It&#39;s always surreal to me that people are listening outside of the group of gamers that I know, but comments like this make it worth the effort!</p>
