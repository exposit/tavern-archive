So, I&#39;m planning to run the 5e campaign Storm King&#39;s Thunder this fall, converting it to Dungeon World for my very small group of 2 players.<br /><br />Any suggestions for converting a 5e campaign for Dungeon World would be appreciated. I know there are blog posts in abundance and advice in the book, but if anyone has their own special tips and tricks, I&#39;m all ears.

        <p>My advice would be to toss out the numbers. Don&#39;t worry about stats at all. Just boil everything down to their fictional elements and then use those to build things in DW.</p>

        <p>I was figuring I would use relevant monster stats from the DW book and the Codex.</p>

        <p>I <i>barely</i> even use monster stats when I run DW. I&#39;ll check out tags and moves, yeah, but like hp and number appearing is almost always a whim thing based on what I think will challenge them. &quot;Oh these goblins are HUGE and muscular - 9hp and there&#39;s 6 of them with hammers in each hand!&quot;<br /><br />I&#39;d say focus on turning 5e things that matter in the adventure into move one-liners first - either location or monster moves. Anything complicated gets a custom move if you want to do it.</p>

        <p>I know this is an old post, but I think <span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink" href="https://plus.google.com/108053817066303198241" oid="108053817066303198241">Chris Stone-Bush</a></span> and <span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink" href="https://plus.google.com/103667855585775066713" oid="103667855585775066713">Aaron Griffin</a></span>&#39;s advice is spot-on for converting any source material for DW. The MAIN thing to remember is DW is Narrative, not tactical! It&#39;s about the fiction, not the number crunching.</p>

        <p>We played a session of D&amp;D 5e over the weekend to see if the system will work for the players. Still undecided, but at least the younger player picked a character class/race that I can easily convert to DW.</p>
