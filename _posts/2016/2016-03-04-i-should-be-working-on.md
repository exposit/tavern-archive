I should be working on my current campaign, but an idea came to me so I&#39;ve been fleshing out ideas for my first complete adventure.  Trying to design it as a one-shot or campaign starter.  The idea is a no-win scenario that will allow the heroes to aid who they can, loot anything that&#39;s not nailed down if they want, and get out alive.  It should also open some doors for future campaign adventures. Below is the summary I&#39;ve put together.  Please let me know what you think.<br /><br />ADVENTURE SUMMARY<br />In the unsuspecting island city of &lt;BLANK&gt;, while our heroes celebrate the passing of Midsummer with the locals, a monstrous, ancient black dragon appears from out of nowhere and wreaks havoc.  All manner of hero charge triumphantly to their demise trying to bring down the beast.  With seemingly no way to bring the dragon down, the heroes must escape the city and live to fight another day.<br /><br />Buildings fall to ruin, reduced to rubble and dust in the streets.  Soul-shattering cries of wanton death pollute the night’s air.  Bands of looters and thugs take advantage of the ensuing chaos, praying on the weak.  Mysterious cultists appear as the fire and brimstone reign down from the sky.  The city watch evacuate citizens to the naval ships as a collection of wizards begin a time lost ritual that will lay waste to the city in a final act of desperation to stop this terrible foe.<br /><br />What do you do?

        <p>Awesome, I&#39;ll have to take a look.  I&#39;m was trying to think up some location moves and things of that nature.</p>

        <p>Spitballing. When a few hours pass or you travel to another part of the city, one player Rolls + Stability (starts at five, write it in marker over an entire sheet of  paper, tear it up and write a new  one as appropriate).  On a hit, the GM chooses one. On a seven through nine, reduce Stability by one as well. On a miss, the party&#39;s path crosses that of the Dragon.  <br />* Someone, or a group of someones, desperately need something from the PCs. Ex : recently orphaned and burnt child, bucket brigade needs more hands, rioters are stealing a ship the city was using to ferry refuges back and forth to the mainland...<br />* The city terrain poses a threat. Ex : burning buildings, collapsing structures, the road has collapsed into the sewers...﻿<br />* The Cult of the Still Heart, who are trying to convert the willing to undead (which the Dragon ignores) to serve their dark master, or the Light of the Fine Years (a small, ruthless band of investigator assassins from an otherwise righteous church who swore a vendetta against the Cult) make a significant power play.</p>
