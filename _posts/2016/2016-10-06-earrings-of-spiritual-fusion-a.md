These earrings bind the wearers into one body.</i><br /><br /><b>When you put one earrring on, and the other by another</b> Roll+WIS. The two bodies merge together to form one. Discribe the new form using qualities from the two original bodies.<br />10+ Choose 2 Benefits<br />7-9 Choose 1 Benefit and 1 side effect<br /><br /><b>Benefits</b><br />&gt; You have the memories of both bodies.<br />&gt; Retain the skills of both bodies.<br />&gt; Both bodies pass on something special to the new form to create a quality not present before the fusion. Discribe the new physical quality.<br /><br /><br /><b>Side Effects</b><br />&gt; The fusion is brief.<br />&gt; The fusion of minds is too much.

        <p>I like it, but it could be unfortunate if the earrings were put on by two PCs, rather than a PC and an NPC.<br /><br />For one thing, which of them rolls +WIS?¬† But more importantly, after the merge one of them would need to make a new character, or they&#39;d have to come up with some way to play with a shared body that can only do so much at once (assuming they don&#39;t get the side-effect of &quot;the fusion is brief&quot;)<br /><br /><b>Edit:</b> Or is the fusion only maintained while the earrings are worn?  If they can be taken off, that would make it less irrevocable.</p>

        <p>The roll is obvious.¬† Only PCs roll.¬† I think in that case, I would see about doing a Move to see who is in control and have a way that it can changed.¬† I would say, personally, if the ear rings are taken off, even one, then the effect ends.</p>

        <p>Im glad you guys got the reference to dbz and steven universe üëè<br /><br />As for ending it, yes removing the earring would end the effect in my game. Of course that is up to your table to decide.</p>
