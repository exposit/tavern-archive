<b>STAT BLOCKS REVISITED</b><br />In the process of writing DW supplement material, I have spent a lot of time thinking about a better way to do monster stat blocks. Better than the core book, that is. I won&#39;t get into why I don&#39;t think that&#39;s a great format unless people ask. Here is my proposal for a streamlined stat block and why I chose to list the information in the manner that I did.<br /><br /><b>The Format</b><br />Proposed standard for a simplified monster stat block for the text of DW supplements: <br /><br /><b>Creature Name</b>: (terrain-optional) tag1, tag2, tag+, <i>special quality</i>. Instinct: to whatever Moves: move1, move2, move+. Weapon: damage, tag1, tag2, tag+. n HP. n Armor.<br /><br />The following is the explanation of how I settled on this format. If you don&#39;t care about that, please skip to the end to catch a full listing of core book monsters in the above format.<br /><br /><b>The Breakdown</b><br />1. Not Listed <br />I do not think the terrain type or description belongs in a streamlined stat block. But I left in a position for the terrain if you want it.<br /><br />2. Instincts First<br />I personally feel that moving the instinct and moves to the front accomplishes three things. It frontloads everything narrative. It emphasizes instincts and moves, which I think are incredibly important and underutilized by many GMs. It also makes the combat stats easier to find, ironically. Moving them to the end seems like it&#39;s a way of making them less important, but because they are the last thing listed your eye can quickly focus on them.<br /><br />3. Tags and Qualities<br />I don&#39;t see any real difference between the way tags and special qualities are used. (Why is &quot;burrowing&quot; special but &quot;planar&quot; not? And does it make any difference in the mechanics or fiction whether it&#39;s a tag or special quality?) So I stuck them all in one place, but recommend italicizing special qualities in case someone cares about the difference. <br /><br />4. Moves<br />I put all the moves in one sentence rather than a separate sentence for each. The only place I noticed this was a problem was for Black Pudding, because both of its moves included lists with commas in them. As I am separating moves with commas, I put those lists in parentheses. In general, a move shouldn&#39;t be so long that it needs a comma in it! :)<br /><br />5. Combat Stats<br />The combat stats seem to have weird and unnecessary formatting in the core book. Why put damage in parentheses? What&#39;s with the semi-colons? I simplified the way they look, putting the weapon tags right after the damage. I considered &quot;8 HP/1 Armor&quot; instead of &quot;8 HP. 1 Armor&quot; but that made for weird line breaks in paragraphs. You would often get &quot;8 HP/1&quot; at the end of a line and &quot;Armor&quot; on the next. <br /><br />6. Graphics/Purpose<br />Many people want to use icons for attacks, armor, etc. That&#39;s cool, but it&#39;s hard to deal with in text. This format is my proposal for a standard, simplified monster block for use in the text DW supplements. If you were designing for, say, a deck of monster cards, things like graphics and white space, line breaks, etc. would be more important.<br /><br /><b>The Listing</b><br />To see how this looks, or if you want a resource you can cut-and-paste from, I put all the creatures from the <i>Dungeon World</i> core book in the simplified format here:<br /><br /><a href="http://www.jellysaw.com/rpg/dw/monsters/monsters.html" class="ot-anchor">http://www.jellysaw.com/rpg/dw/monsters/monsters.html</a><br /><br />My other DW resources can be found one step up (see the DW Codex breadcrumb at the top of the linked page). I don&#39;t have a lot there, but there is a GM move randomizer you might like. And a simple suggestion for assigning default damage (rather than always rolling creature damage).

Jellysaw: DW Codex: Monsters A-Z. Creature Name: tag1, tag2, tag+, special quality. Instinct: to whatever Moves: move1, move2, move+. Weapon: damage, tag1, tag2, tag+. n HP. n Armor. Aboleth: group, huge, intelligent, telepathy. Instinct: to command. Moves: invade a mind, turn minions on them, ...

        <p>I can&#39;t comment on your actual post.<br /><br />Not sure if it helps, but what I use is a format like this:<br /><br />Big Creature Thing (solitary, huge, intelligent, 10hp, 1 armor) Short description about how it looks. Instinct: to do stuff. Moves: go this way, go that way, punch (d10, close), kick (2d6+2, close).<br /><br />The main takeaways: hp and armor are basically just tags, so I stick them with that list; I include a rough description; and stick attacks in with moves because, well, they&#39;re moves!<br /><br />I also regularly make up my own tags, if I can express a thing in 1-2 words. Like &quot;gaseous&quot; or &quot;incorporeal&quot; or &quot;undead&quot;.</p>

        <p>The brevity helps, but it&#39;s not especially fast to read. You have to scan across a line to land on the right element. If there were unicode symbols breaking it up then you&#39;d be able to find things like moves, damage, and armour a lot quicker.<br /><br />It might not be your own preference, but I know from experience with games that use graphical dice pools that symbols are much faster to read than words and thus keep attention on the game.<br /><br />That&#39;s my 2 cents, it may not be your cup of tea.</p>

I like your take on HP and Armor as tags and weapons as moves. I am going to think about that some more. I may prefer it to my own proposal.</p>

However, if you write a lot, you quickly find that special characters are a bitch in publishing. Not all font sets have the basic ones. Choosing &quot;sensical&quot; ones for each thing is annoying and contentious. For the purpose of a baseline, I think it&#39;s best to stick to characters visible on the keyboard and rtf formatting to get the job done. But I don&#39;t disagree with your thoughts at all.</p>

In my own notes I try to use parenthesis to break up things like tag lists. If I&#39;m using an editor that can bold, I might bold the words &quot;instinct&quot; and &quot;moves&quot; to make it more scannable.</p>

        <p>Hmmm. <span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink" href="https://plus.google.com/103667855585775066713" oid="103667855585775066713">Aaron Griffin</a></span>, I&#39;m doing this in a spreadsheet so it is easy for me to spit out alternates in a few minutes. I tried your format and both liked and didn&#39;t like it. I decided to implement the formatting for weapons - putting the damage and the tags in parens. But I did not include them with the moves and HP/Armor with tags, even though that &quot;makes sense,&quot; because I didn&#39;t like having the &quot;stats&quot; divided up and interspersed with the narrative elements.</p>

        <p>I actually kind of like this. I always feel during play i miss some stuff out and have to scramble to find things. I will probably use this!</p>

        <p>I note that the Hydra entry has split the special quality &quot;Only killed by a blow to the heart&quot; into &quot;only killed by a blow . Instinct: to the heart.&quot;, and lost its actual Instinct &quot;To grow&quot;.</p>
