Just curious to know if you guys would let one of your players wear a chainmail and a plate armor at the same time for a Paladin? It looks to me like this would be inconvenient as movements would be severely restricted, but then again the Paladin ignores the clumsy tag for armors...

        <p>No. Well, I mean, sure, if it&#39;s just the <i>look</i> the Paladin is after, but I wouldn&#39;t allow the stacking armor bonuses. My understanding is that the armor number is a kind of rating. It&#39;s 1 Armor and 3 Armor, not +1 and +3 Armor. So Plate plus anything except a shield is still just 3.Â </p>

        <p>I think chainmail is usually included under plate mail by default. At least I see it as you&#39;re getting that one extra armor from the extra layer of armor plates on top of the chainmail. To answer your question, I don&#39;t let my players &quot;layer&quot; armor like you are saying.</p>

        <p>Historically it was often combined - certainly in the earlier plate armours where articulation technology was in its infancy.  &quot;Transitional plate&quot; or &quot;floating plate&quot; armours were on base hauberks of mail.  And in general - yeah, no advantage.  Articulated plate is not improved by wearing mail underneath it - you just get heavier and clumsier.  I&#39;d also rule that it gives two clumsy tags to do it, and the Paladin is only allowed to ignore one clumsy tag in DW.</p>

        <p>I agree with Scott. Why would someone wear plate without chain at all? The layered approach makes more sense when contemplating their armor values.</p>

        <p>By &quot;articulated plate&quot; - I mean plate that has joints covered, and the joints still bend/move.  Mail was used when they couldn&#39;t do that properly as something almost, but not quite as good as plate.</p>

        <p>Should I point out that Plate + Shield is Armor 4, which is the same armor as a freaking <b>sauropod</b> or an <b>earth elemental!</b> :) There are only four creatures in the game with armor 5, and two of them are dragons. Here&#39;s the list. It&#39;s clear that armor ratings are not supposed to go higher that 4 or 5. Also, it&#39;s very clear in the book that you can&#39;t wear two kinds of armor in order to get the bonus (otherwise it would have the + in front of the value). I think plate just assumes extra coverage where you need it, so narratively it might have chainmail mixed in, but mechanically it&#39;s &quot;plate.&quot;<br /><br />Apocalypse Dragon 5<br />Dragon 5<br />Inevitable 5<br />Lich 5<br />Angel 4<br />Blink Dog 4<br />Chuul 4<br />Djinn 4<br />Dragon Turtle 4<br />Earth Elemental 4<br />Formian Drone 4<br />Knight 4<br />Magmin 4<br />Nightmare 4<br />Sauropod 4<br />Shadow 4</p>

        <p>Stacking armor like that makes me think someone is trying to min-max the game, which isn&#39;t gonna work in DW</p>

        <p>Indeed, not sure how I missed it: &quot;If you have more than 1 item with n Armor, only the highest value counts.&quot; Page 325.<br /><br />Thanks all for the insights and feedback!</p>

        <p>I&#39;m not sure if this has been brought up yet but unless you&#39;re talking full plate, plate mail is mail or leather reinforced by solid plating.  So wearing plates over the mail, yeah.  That&#39;s why it&#39;s called plate-MAIL. <br /><br />This is just like asking if you can combine padded and chain and my answer would be &quot;you sort of have to, have you ever tried to wear any sort of mail without a padded cuirass? It is really not comfortable.&quot;</p>

        <p>This also reminds of the player in an MotW game that was trying to get dual-wielding bonuses and we told the GM that mechanically it&#39;s one weapon and maybe he can justify some stunts with it but no bonus attack.</p>

        <p>A paladin on a quest with a plate and a shield is already at armor 5. Its a frigging tank! ðŸ˜…</p>

        <p>It&#39;s min maxy and pointless, but a fighter who takes barkskin can have 7 armor, then if he takes underdog then he can have 8 when he is outnumbered!!!! Screw those bandits, they aren&#39;t going to make a dent. Of course the second he fights something that ignores armor he&#39;s going to regret his move choices lol. But fighters also have the move that&#39;s basically bloody aegis but using your armor to take the hits instead of your conditions, so yeah.... fighters be crazy</p>

        <p>Fighters are supposed to be crazy when it comes to fighting (yo). I don&#39;t think that&#39;s necessarily min-maxing any more than a Bard taking Thing-Talker so they can flirt with rocks. It&#39;s just playing their role to the <i>friggin&#39; hilt.</i></p>

        <p>Don&#39;t get me wrong, if you want to play a fighter who does exceptionally well in an uneven fight and for some reason has gained a blessing from nature to make his skin harder when they are touching the ground (maybe they defended a druid grove from a horde of orcs?) Then by all means be my guest. Actually that character sounds awesome lol</p>
