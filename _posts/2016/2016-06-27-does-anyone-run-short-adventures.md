Does anyone run short adventures? Like 2-2.5 hours? I&#39;m hoping to be able to run a weekly or biweekly game on a weekday but I can only do it for a couple hours. Does anyone see that being an issue? Any tips?

        <p>I have run 2 hour adventures; the same rules I followed for 4 hour adventures apply just the same:<br />1. Make it very clear ahead of time the start and end times.<br />2. When there is only an hour left of game time, let everyone know.<br />3. When there is only 10 minutes left of game time, let everyone know that NOW is the time to wrap things up.<br />4. Cut table-chatter.<br />5. Unless it can be resolved within twenty seconds OR a PC&#39;s life hangs in the balance, save rules discussions for after the game.  Otherwise try to be as fair as possible.</p>

        <p>2 hour adventures are simple as long as you keep the pace going and try to cut complex discussion among players short.</p>

        <p>Short sessions work just fine. As other people have said, just make sure the players know they don&#39;t have a lot of time.</p>

        <p>I sponsor a gaming club at the high school I teach at and I run 2 hour sessions all the time. The kids are really into it but it was hard to fit in the end of session stuff because we&#39;re usually really into the story until the last minute. I started paying attention to the clock more so we could finish the session properly.</p>

        <p>I normally run 4 hour games, I would find two hours a bit of a squeeze since you&#39;d have to make sure everyone was dead on time and cut down on extraneous chatter to ensure anything got done in the game (as P Snow said), but getting to chat and socialise is part of the enjoyment for me.</p>

This is why I asked because I enjoy that stuff too. But I&#39;m thinking that I might be able to game a little more regularly if I can do weekday 2 hour games. We will see.</p>

Personally I know I struggle fitting everything into four hours for a one shot.</p>

        <p>We&#39;ve been running 2-hour sessions lately and they&#39;re way better than 3-4 hours, especially for online games. I know I start getting distracted after about 2 hours if it&#39;s not an in-person session.</p>

        <p>I almost exclusively run 2.5 hour sessions these days because 4 is a tall order for many of my players. Things that help:<br /><br />1. Start time is after everyone is done eating, so encourage players to bring food or eat before they arrive. <br /><br />2. Drop reminders that time is still passing in game even if they stop to plan out of character. &quot;You hear sirens in the distance&quot; is useful in modern-day campaign settings. <br /><br />3. Don&#39;t make them hunt too much for info. Just tell them when they ask something unless it&#39;s actually a major secret to be uncovered with effort.</p>

        <p>Check out Talking Games. The most recent episode is actually about shorter sessions specifically, but they give a bunch of relevant advice through the whole show.<br /><br /><a href="http://misdirectedmark.com/talking-games-seventeen-short-form-games/" class="ot-anchor">misdirectedmark.com/talking-games-seventeen-short-form-games/</a></p>
