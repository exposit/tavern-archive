“Kid, this isn’t a job to take care of nature nor to guide a lost fellow back to safety. A hunter picks or is given a target and with keen eyes it tracks it down, with cunning it lures it, and with a well placed trap it captures it. Now, pack your bags and fetch that crossbow, kid, we’ve got a beast to catch! ”<br /><br />- Arabella Windhammer, Hunter.<br /><br />This product contains two files:<br /><br />A 21 page playbook containing 21 moves, gear, poisons, and magic items.<br />Four compendium classes: Beast Hunter, Bounty Hunter, Vampire Hunter, and Witch Hunter.<br />The dhampir, a new race with custom moves for you to use.<br />A two page character sheet for you to record your character&#39;s stats, gear, and moves.

        <p>Good playbook. <br />Moves are interesting and different enough from the ranger and the existing Hunter. <br />I only cringed at The Blood of My Enemy, but that&#39;s just me. <br />Also, what about finishing the race / names part? Good that the standar sheet model was used. <br />It could very well have a firearm as an optional starting weapon.<br />Finally, why so many blank starting moves spaces?  </p>

        <p>Excellent move forward of using all dismissed moves as Compedium Classes and a Race. Man, you should update all your playbooks with this!</p>

The move was conceived before we contemplated making compendium classes. Maybe it would be best to swap the move with one from the witch hunter cc. I agree on the firearm part, why we didn&#39;t add a firearm alludes me at the moment. Maybe it&#39;s something we can add on a future update.<br /><br />In regards to the blank moves, I usually like to leave space for custom moves or moves from a cc. I hate seeing blank spaces on character sheets, perhaps it would be better to leave it blank?<br /><br />You say we moved forward by using dismissed moves as Compendium Classes. So far Dwarfare Games (<a href="https://plus.google.com/b/104200073560524096819/104200073560524096819" class="ot-anchor">https://plus.google.com/b/104200073560524096819/104200073560524096819</a>)<br />has two products (The witch doctor and the hunter.) and both of those products contain compendium classes. My debut was through Awful Good Games <span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink" href="https://plus.google.com/117134143142507309944" oid="117134143142507309944">David Guyll</a></span>   the Headhunter, maybe you are referring to their product format of adding a behind the scenes with additional moves that didn&#39;t make  the cut? Which by the way is an excellent way to provide extra content and makes perfect use of additional free space on a character sheet to add space for custom moves.</p>

That&#39;s what gave me the impression. <br />Well, why not update the playbook as soon as you have your impressions and feedback. We who paid for it would appreciate it. <br />Once again good work, and three interesting and well executed playbooks!</p>
