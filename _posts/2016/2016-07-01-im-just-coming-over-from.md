I&#39;m just coming over from Pathfinder and wanted to run a campaign. One of my player&#39;s is interested in playing the Swordmage or Spellsword class, but was kind of confused since he believed they had spellslots. I got the book, but just wanted to make sure I wasn&#39;t missing anything. Does the Arcane Duelist/Swordmage/Spellsword have any spell slots?

        <p>What book is the Swordmage or Spellsword playbook in? I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve seen that one.</p>

        <p>Honestly, if this is your first time with DW, I&#39;d recommend sticking with the core classes. Branch out after you have a good understanding of how the game works and how it plays.</p>

        <p>I don&#39;t think I could help you, but welcome to Dungeon World. It takes a bit to get used to the system, but it allows for a lot of freedom not otherwise found in Pathfinder. </p>

        <p>Thanks for the greetings guys and I appreciate your advice. I think I will just stick to the core classes for now. It seems like a style of game that I enjoy a lot more so I think I got a little excited when I saw all these branched out classes and kind of forgot that this is still a new game to me. Thanks for all the help again guys!</p>

        <p>Yeah. I recommend sticking to the core classes in the <i>Dungeon World</i> book. I also recommend making completely new characters rather than trying to transfer over PCs from another game.<br /><br />Also, forget all of that <i>Pathfinder</i> stuff, as running/playing <i>DW</i> is very different.<br /><br />Welcome to the Tavern. :D</p>

        <p>Allow his wizard to have a sword for a weapon.  Later he can take multiclass moves to grab fighter stuff.  That&#39;s a brute force way towards a sword mage.</p>

        <p>In case you mean the Arcane Duelist Class - it is terribly balanced and not well designed.<br /><br />Some discussion about it here: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DungeonWorld/comments/4m843f/arcane_duelist_question/" class="ot-anchor">https://www.reddit.com/r/DungeonWorld/comments/4m843f/arcane_duelist_question/</a></p>

        <p>The Swordmage class has spells to choose from on top of their regular moves. I have played one through level 10 and can say it was the most fun I&#39;ve had with a character so far in Dungeon World. I even consider it a core class choice in the games I run now. They are a little powerful, but not anymore than druids, or even fighters who have maxed their damage. I feel like the Swordmage needs more quick thinking to be overly powerful.</p>

        <p>Definitely read and re-read the Dungeon World Guide, available from the Dungeon World website (<a href="http://dungeon-world.com" class="ot-anchor">HTTP://dungeon-world.com</a>). It fills in some gaps about how to play and think about the game.</p>
