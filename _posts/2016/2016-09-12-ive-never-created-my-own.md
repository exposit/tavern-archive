I&#39;ve never created my own playbooks, but I&#39;m interested in creating one based on a Hunchback. Now, I know what you&#39;re thinking &quot;John, that sounds stupid. Why in the hell would anyone want to play that?!&quot; But it will be part of a trilogy of playbooks...

        <p>Not trying to discourage you, but one suggestion I heard was to start with designing Compendium Classes as a way to ease into designing full playbooks.  A Compendium Class sounds like a good fit for a Hunchback, who could be any of a number of different professions (fighter, wizard, cleric...)</p>

        <p>Hmmm. I kinda see it like the racial playbooks from Awful Good Games. Three of the starting moves you&#39;d get to choose for the Hunchback would be Bell Ringer (think Quasimodo with parkour abilities), Lab Assistant (Igor type with bonuses to Spout Lore maybe), Sideshow (super-ugly, either bonus to Parley with monsters or maybe some sort of intimidation ability or both). I see the Hunchback having abilities that assist and buff it&#39;s master and party members, as well as gaining some melee abilities. Nothing is set in stone of course.</p>

To quote A Sundered World: &quot;In this way, you can think of races as compendium classes that you automatically qualify for: when you level up, choose a move from your class, or one of the moves from your race.&quot; The only difference is that with most CCs you have to spend a move to qualify, while the racial CCs just offer you a generic racial move to start with (just as normal DW classes have a racial move). There are other racial playbooks out there where your race is your class. So the question is, do you want their reality of being a hunchback to be pretty much the only thing that matters about how they relate to the world? Personally, I agree with Robert that it sounds like a better fit as a CC.</p>

        <p>Eh, not the monster playbooks they have, which is what I would want this to be similar to.</p>

        <p>Oh, like &quot;The Skeleton.&quot; I guess if you were thinking of the hunchback as a monster that makes sense. I didn&#39;t realize that is where you were heading.</p>

        <p>Yep! Like an Igor or Quasimodo type.</p>

        <p>I&#39;d say definitely start with a compendium class. If you have more you want to put into it and want to make a full class, well you already have a solid base from the compendium class.</p>

        <p>Try this: can you think of 6 to 10 moves for your class with ease?  If so,  it can be done as a class, otherwise  stick to CC.  If it&#39;s a trilogy of Playbooks,  why not make it a Playbook with 3 CC?</p>

        <p>You might find the Mad Scientist class by redditor /u/wargonzola useful. It is a doctor Frankenstein and contains some Igor elements. <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/d1nhlhiaz4b2a9y/Unnatural%20Philosopher%20v4.pdf?dl=0" class="ot-anchor">https://www.dropbox.com/s/d1nhlhiaz4b2a9y/Unnatural%20Philosopher%20v4.pdf?dl=0</a></p>
