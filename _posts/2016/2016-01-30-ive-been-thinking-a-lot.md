I&#39;ve been thinking a lot about the Immolator for the past week, especially if GRRM were the DM.<br /><br />Someone on reddit posted questions about the Firebender base move... Zuka... No, Zuko Style. I decided to write two little moves that were terrible versions of advanced moves that I wanted your thoughts on. Too powerful? Unbalanced? Removes utility of other moves?<br /><br /><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DungeonWorld/comments/43a4h5/zuko_style_question_immolator/" class="ot-anchor">https://www.reddit.com/r/DungeonWorld/comments/43a4h5/zuko_style_question_immolator/</a><br /><br />Melisandre stared intently at the bonfire where the heretics screamed in agony. &quot;I command the flames to show me the shape and form of the man is Azor Ahai, the Prince that was Promised, the one who will destroy the Others...&quot; She frowned. Before it had shown her King Stannis with Lightbringer, but now all it showed was snow...<br /><br />(Lore of Flames with an evil sacrifice for a weak bonus: if you burn an unwilling creature alive, you can ask the creature one question before it dies. The flames will take its form and it will nod, shake its head, gesture/point/pantomime in a meaningful and truthful fashion.)<br /><br />(Alternately, sacrificing a useful object like a book of maps and saying &quot;I command the flames to point in the direction of the treasure we most desire!&quot; could be a way to get the flames to take form and move as you desire as long as they have fuel...)<br /><br /><br />Beric Dondarrion stopped dancing the hempen jig long ago. He now dangled loosely from the hangman&#39;s noose tight around his neck. Thoros hiccuped and swiped in the air several times with his burning sword, eventually cutting his companion down to the ground. He took a swig of firebrandy and imbued it with the flames of the Last Rites. He pressed his lips to Beric&#39;s and breathed out with cleansing fire to send him to the Red God. However, to Thoros&#39; surprise, Beric lurched upwards, stepping back from Death&#39;s Door, somehow imbued by the Last Kiss! Thoros could tell that a part of Beric was consumed as kindling, his second chance at life being fueled by a loss of humanity and a loss of his memories...<br /><br />(Ogdru Jahad/Burning Bridges move with severe and twisted consequences that the players won&#39;t like: you can save a comrade from Death&#39;s Door but they lose all bonds, all advanced moves, and no longer gain XP.)<br /><br />Thoughts?

I've played my first session as an immolator but everyone in the party , including me and our GM, is confused about what Zuko style actually...
