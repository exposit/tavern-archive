        <p>If you&#39;ve an hexcrawl - sandbox, maybe you would like to have more proactive players. <br /><br />So, i would ask them to set an ambitious goal as a group:<br />(We want X to be king. We want to be filthy rich. We want to delete trolls from the world)<br /><br />At the end of the question, you may ask:<br /><br />Did we step a milestone in the accomplishment of our goal?</p>
