Hello, Tavern! Following up on the Sorcerer playbook I created back in January, I&#39;d like to present the 3rd and final version of the Warlock playbook I&#39;ve been working on since then. It&#39;s now up on DriveThruRPG for free!<br /><br />The class has evolved quite a bit over the last 5 months, going from a more standard &quot;three specialties&quot; approach (similar to the sorcerer), to having a 2-page layout including custom patron moves, to a more spacious 3-page layout that allows for more patrons and less terse move wordings.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I&#39;m a perma-DM in my groups, so this is very much in need of some love and playtesting! I&#39;d offer to give free copies to anyone who provides feedback, but it&#39;s already free, so... feedback still appreciated!
