Does Freebooters on the Frontier REPLACE Funnel World or does it supplement it? The blurbs for FotF reference FW but it is unclear what exactly the relationship is.

        <p>Supplements it, if desired. It can stand alone.</p>

        <p>Page 1 of Freebooters says: &quot;It’s intended for use with the Dungeon World rules, and makes use of concepts presented in The Perilous Wilds, a Dungeon World supplement. You will need both of these books in order to make sense of everything presented herein.&quot;<br /><br />I haven&#39;t read any of Funnel World, but it doesn&#39;t strike me as a &quot;funnel&quot; game.</p>

        <p>It&#39;s set up so that you can take characters you generate in Funnel World and then (if they survive) upgrade them into a Fighter/Cleric/Thief/Wizard from Freebooters.<br /><br />The stats &amp; bonuses are the same, the racial moves are the same, etc.</p>
