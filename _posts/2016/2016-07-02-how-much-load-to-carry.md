How much Load to carry someone?<br /><br />(I ask because the party hacked the legs off of a dwarf who betrayed them, then cauterised the stumps, and now one of them is carrying the dwarf on their back.)

        <p>I&#39;d just tell them they can&#39;t carry a pack like that and someone else will have to carry their gear</p>

        <p>I&#39;d probably go with 5 weight. Maybe 6.  It should be enough that a high-load (12-15) character will notice and probably have to give up some gear, and a low-load (7-9) basically can&#39;t do it. <br /><br />Looking at the gear list for comparisons isn&#39;t be much help, because the weight of items and the load of transport are all on a pretty inconsistent scale. (E.g. Two swords burden you as much as a keg of dwarven stout.  A warhorse would collapse under the weight of a fully-loaded paladin or fighter. )</p>

        <p>I&#39;d go with &quot;automatically at max load&quot;. <br />Is not a matter of weight, it&#39;s more about the ability to do stuff without being encumbered by what you&#39;re carrying... A person is as big as a person (duh), so you&#39;re carrying a volume that encumbers all of you.</p>

I don&#39;t know about you, but I&#39;d be pretty damn encumbered if I was humping around a legless dwarf, even if I was a hulking Barbarian with mighty thews.</p>

Wearing armour means you can&#39;t give piggy backs? DW doesn&#39;t sound like that sort of game.<br /><br />I mean, if we get down to a willing halfling (with legs to hold on with) what then?<br /><br />Do we start with 6?<br /><br />* -1 for missing limbs<br />* +1 for unwilling<br />* +1 for willing<br />* -1 for small<br />* +1 for large<br />* +1 for drunk</p>

        <p>I don&#39;t think DW needs all that math and details... It&#39;s not D&amp;D, and Load is not &quot;weight carried&quot;. <br />In fact, carrying a person missing a limb may be even more complex, they can&#39;t hold on to you (or you hold them) as good as with full-bodied one.<br /><br />My logic is: in all cases, you are encumbered enough to make most physical actions very complex. <br />Jump a fence, swing a sword, climb a ladder... Try that while carrying a (cooperating) 15 years old person on your back. Or don&#39;t, it&#39;s dangerous. Don&#39;t sue me after trying, too. XD <br /><br />Then mentally add these factors: they are unconscious, they carry a backpack of their stuff, and you&#39;re in an hostile environment (possibly trying to be stealthy not to attract a  monster, for example). <br /><br />No matter how strong you are, it&#39;s insanely difficult to do any of these things without taking a lot of time. :/</p>

It&#39;s also a non-permanent problem in most settings, with healing magic that powerful. <br /><br />Not nice to see, if course, but one can get better. ^^;</p>

        <p>Oh sure. A dragon biting off a limb is to be expected in a high fantasy setting. But the party doing it, even to an &quot;evil&quot; NPC, starts to push the game into a morally grey area for me.</p>

        <p>Definitely. That opens the whole chapter about players having cruel PCs, why, etc.<br />In my experience, there&#39;s a factor of &#39;it&#39;s not real, I can do stuff I&#39;d never do in real life, let me vent&#39;. I&#39;m a different kind of player, but I&#39;ve seen a few.</p>

That was it - the game moved on. I wanted to know what other people would have done.<br /><br />Had I taken your route, they would have started hacking off more limbs so that this magical scenario of carrying anyone encumbering you would be nullified.<br /><br />When you create a mechanical penalty in a game the player must ask, &quot;how can I get rid of this penalty?&quot;<br /><br />Your solution is, &quot;don&#39;t carry anyone.&quot; To which the next question is, &quot;what do I have to do to them to make them not qualify as someone?&quot;</p>

        <p>I guess my personal, in no way official, and very debatable answer is: &quot;I think that you have to kill him, chop him into pieces in a lengthy and messy process that will leave whoever does that covered in blood and other smelly, sticky and unpleasant fluids... You sure you wanna do that?&quot; <br /><br />I&#39;m not a doctor, but I think that, unless the PCs have access to absurdly sharp tools (or magical equivalent), amputations and dismemberments are a REALLY messy and complex thing. You can ask a butcher, for example, and they work on dead animals,  in prepared environments, and with modern tools.<br /><br />It depends a lot on your setting&#39;s technology/magic. </p>
