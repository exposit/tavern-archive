Ok, here are my basic Stats and Basic/Secondary Moves and Races.  I am working on a sort of best of the 4 types.  Still need to create the Dosiers and put in how damage is done, ect.

        <p>This is my current conglomeration of all the Shadowrun Dungeon World Hacks that I found.  It&#39;s a Start.  I found 4 versions, trying to make the best of them and keep the feel of Shadowrun for a game I am going to run in a week.  Going to convert over the begining adventures.  I may start with Food Fight from the base book 1st ed Shadowrun that I still have.  I still have to make the Dossiers and make up how damage is done.  Going with the damage track rather than the hitpoints.</p>
