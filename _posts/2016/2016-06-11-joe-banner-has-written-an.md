Joe Banner has written an amazing collection of Dungeon World adventures, but the &quot;Master of the short DW classic&quot; is breaking his wands and hanging up his pointy hat, at least for now. Check out his complete collection!

So it's a bit after Christmas… but if you're still tucking into Turkey and enjoying the holiday season, you could do worse than have a go with this stocking filler, designed for all good OSR or Dungeon-Crawler titles! Ho ho ho! …Wow. That came out a lot more sales-pitchy than I expected.

        <p>Wait. He&#39;s hanging up his hat? As in he&#39;s not making DW adventures any more?</p>

        <p>I&#39;ll let Joe speak for himself:<br /><br />Dear friends,<br /><br />For over two years you&#39;ve supported my monthly PDFs here on Patreon. However, it&#39;s with a heavy heart I tell you this will soon be changing.<br /><br />It&#39;s probably no secret my output has slowed of late. Changes of circumstances and new work/life commitments over the last year or so have meant less time to write and design adventures, much less run them. When I have had time, I&#39;ve wanted to work on new material and renovating my older work, but felt guilty of doing so at the cost of my Patreon commitments.<br /><br />A Monthly Format for Re-releases<br />So, here&#39;s what I propose. This Patreon will shortly be switching to a monthly payment model, which will support brand new print collections and new releases of previous content instead of new, unique PDFs. The current rewards will be removed. (If you have an outstanding reward, I might not be able to accomodate this any more; get in touch, and we&#39;ll work it out.)<br /><br />As of writing, the releases on the to-do list are:<br /><br />Shadows of Umberto, definitive edition<br />Green Scar, definitive edition<br />Untitled Mirkasa Collection (The Planarch Vault, Logansfell, et al.)<br /><br />These will all be printed products explicitly for Dungeon World, sold on DriveThruRPG (or similar.) I&#39;ve little idea of prices, but there will be some kind of patrons-only discount for a week or so after release like I did with Jakabol.<br /><br />As I say, my free time is very limited these days. I can&#39;t guarantee there&#39;ll be new content every month. I might not get all these projects completed as intended, or they may take several months. I&#39;ll make every effort to post updates here or on Google+.<br /><br />What&#39;s Next? <br /><br />Naturally, I understand that this new model is not what you signed up for - you can amend your pledge at <a href="http://patreon.com/pledges" class="ot-anchor">patreon.com/pledges</a> (click the &#39;edit&#39; link, to the far right of my picture.) I know some of you have only just joined - I sympathise! - so let me say thank you, from the bottom of my heart, to everyone who has helped out over the years. Your pledges have always been gratefully received, and I hope everyone feels they got their money&#39;s worth from them. As always, comments can be sent through Patreon, Google+ or email.<br /><br />Final Thoughts<br />This feels a bit like goodbye, but it isn&#39;t really (which is just as well because I&#39;m terrible at them.) For now, let me say a heartfelt thank you for everything. You&#39;ve all been great, and although things are changing, I hope you won&#39;t be strangers. Take care, have fun, and always play more games!<br /><br />Joe Banner<br />April 2016</p>

        <p><b>Monty Python voice</b> I&#39;m not dead yet!<br /><br />I&#39;m out and about at the moment, but I&#39;m not finished with DW adventures yet! More details later. </p>

        <p>Right, first of all, I&#39;d love to know who quoted me on as the &quot;Master of the short DW classic&quot;. (Everyone writes shorter DW adventures than me!) <br /><br />Second, as I mentioned yesterday - not dead. Just resting! I had a hell of a couple of months, writing wasn&#39;t the priority. Things are getting better.<br /><br />The Patreon is also still alive. If you&#39;re a pledger reading this, know I appreciate you sticking with me. If you&#39;re not and want to join, you can expect fresh content starting in the summer. <br /><br /><b>Shadows of Umberto</b> is in the pre-proof design stages. Assuming everything checks out, it&#39;ll be on sale - in PDF and <i>print</i> - around the start of July. I&#39;ve worked hard on this, so I&#39;d hate for anyone to think I&#39;ve given up on writing just before something really awesome is about to come out.</p>
