Derp, almost forgot about this.<br /><br />Barbarian would share the totem concept with the 4E barbarian. Probably also have some sort of rage currency.<br /><br />Blackguard would be a flip of the paladin, being based on vices or sins instead of virtues (but not a lazy reskin/rename of things).<br /><br />Devourer is something at least partially cooked up by <span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink" href="https://plus.google.com/109607886513986535717" oid="109607886513986535717">Jcheats</a></span>: you eat things to gain their powers!<br /><br />Rogue is basically a rename of the thief. Wouldn&#39;t be the same thing, but would share the same role.<br /><br />Therianthrope would be a general were-thing: instead of making a werewolf, werebear, and so on, we&#39;d <i>ideally</i> make it so that by choosing abilities you can customize your animal shape.<br /><br /> <a rel="nofollow" class="ot-hashtag" href="https://plus.google.com/s/%23dungeonworld/posts">#dungeonworld</a>    <a rel="nofollow" class="ot-hashtag" href="https://plus.google.com/s/%23classvote/posts">#classvote</a>

I&#39;ll have to look into that now! :) <br /><br />So, as with our other playbooks, the idea would be to provide the ability to focus on specific archetypes (like thug and silvertongued-guy). Of course the moves will reflect this.</p>
