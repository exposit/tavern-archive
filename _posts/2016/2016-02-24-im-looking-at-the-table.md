I&#39;m looking at the table for creating monsters and my group of monsters (werewolves) get the tag organized. I can&#39;t think of good organized moves. Can someone help me?

        <p>Maybe not the most creative ones but how about: Separate them, surround them, call for reinforcement and come to aid?</p>

        <p>Also, if you&#39;re willing to think about it a different way, put down the book for a moment...<br /><br />You want a pack of werewolves. What will that look like? Are they really smart, really scary wolves? Are they neigh indestructible creatures who attack en masse? Are they able to talk, and be reasoned with? Are they master hunters?<br /><br />How do you want the players to feel when they attack?<br /><br />I would consider describing your monsters as narratively as possible, then picking moves to match, rather than the other way around.</p>

        <p>A good one for a wolf pack is &quot;drag off their weakest member.&quot;Â <br /><br />A group of werewolves is just goblins with slightly different HP . . . until they pull the Wizard away from the fighter and off into the shadows.</p>

        <p>If it were my game, I would use the pack tactics to scare my PCs.<br /><br />Hear the wolves before seeing them. Sounds of running off in the woods but nothing there when they look. Later followed by howls and panting.<br /><br />The first attacks would be drive-by assaults. On a failed Discern Realities roll, I&#39;d have one of the PCs bowled over by something large that comes out of the woods and then disappears. Maybe not even do damage.<br /><br />Then I&#39;d choose the PC with the lowest constitution or strength and ask what they are doing. I&#39;d let them make their rolls based on the fiction, but I&#39;d keep focusing on them and the party&#39;s reaction to them. I&#39;d want to keep reinforcing that the weakest one is the one that is being singled out. The party can then react if they want, but if they ignore it, I&#39;d go from there.<br /><br />I think that would lend a creepy vibe to the whole encounter and dragging a weaker character off, even if it is only to kidnap them and turn them over to a wizard warlord and not kill them could help the story move into some interesting places.</p>

        <p>Hey thanks to all of you. That helped me so much. And that scary situation from <span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink" href="https://plus.google.com/114075227630675466545" oid="114075227630675466545">Jim Jones</a></span> is really cool. I&#39;ll use that when they meet the werewolves the first time</p>
