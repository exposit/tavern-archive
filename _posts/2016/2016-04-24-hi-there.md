Hi there! I&#39;d want to share with you the last item I wrote. It was great if you tell me everything you think about it: good things, bad things. EVERYTHING, no mercy, please, I &#39;ve to learn ^^. I also apologise for grammar mistakes, I&#39;m an italian guy who tries to do his best :D Enjoy!<br /><br />Phalanx of Black Gate<br /><br />A phalanx hooked and pearly used as a stylus is able to write everywhere, the font will change according to the surface (can magically affect the wood, use a bloody ink on paper, create little eddies in the water).<br /><b>When you decide to use the Phalanx for the first time</b>, say a word that identifies what the character wants most in the world, even the most hidden desire. ONLY a word.<br />Then write the name of a person and rolls:<br />with 10+ take 3. with 7-9 take 1. <br />You can spend the grabs, 1 to 1, at any time to:<br />-kill, even at a distance, outright, that person. GM will know how.<br />-Get help, even in the most desperate situation, from this person<br />-Get in the body of this person. Return to your body means spending the remaining grabs. With a 7-9, you return into your body when you use again the Falange<br />-teleport yourself instantly in front of that person<br />-teleport that person instantly in front of  you<br /><br />Writing a new name means  giving up the previous grabs.<br />Whenever you write a name, a letter of the word chosen at first will be marked on your body.<br />When your desire is entirely branded on your body and you have to roll on Last Breath considers 10+ as 7-9: Death gave you a chance to realize yourself, there&#39;s no way to come back to life again without have payed your debt.

        <p>Seems really powerful.  And how do we know when the desire is branded in its entirety?  Is it like; &quot;I want to rule Parsantium as king&quot;?  Mean each time it is used, one word of the sentence is written upon the character&#39;s body?  </p>

        <p>nope. Your desire MUST be formulated as a single word: it could be &quot;Power&quot; &quot;authority&quot; &quot;wealth&quot; and stuff alike. Each time you use the phalanx, a letter of this word is branded on you :)</p>

        <p>Ah!  Sorry, I just couldn&#39;t quite grasp that.  Now I get it.  It is a really interesting idea.  I like it a lot and might steal it.  </p>

        <p>It is such a great DARK sword and sorcery artifact.  In the hands of an ambitious noble or power hungry wizard... I might use it as a catalyst for an adventure.  That it is in the hands of a &quot;bad&quot; guy and the PCs need to recover it before he or she uses it for bad intent.  </p>

        <p>yeah, why not? :D I also wonder how my players could use it. I like both the power and the huge amount of complications these item offers. Like Death does :p </p>
