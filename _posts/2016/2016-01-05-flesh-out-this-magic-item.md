        <p>Oh my ! My actual campaign involves a secret cult whose members have bat tatoos, bat trinkets... This could definitely be the leader&#39;s bat brooch.</p>

        <p>The Fashion Bat<br /><br />When you <b>wear The Fashion Bat pinned to your lapel</b>, roll+Cha. On a 10+, choose 2; on a 7-9, choose 1.<br /><br />- You don&#39;t look ridiculous<br />- You don&#39;t look like an easy mark for mugging<br />- You don&#39;t attract bats sexually</p>

        <p>While you <b>wear the Bat pinned you to your lapel</b>, you may sell a shiny cheap trinket for 10 times its value.  Roll +CHA.  On a 10+, both; on a 7–9 pick one: <br />* You&#39;re long gone before the buyer notices what they actually bought<br />* The buyer doesn&#39;t remember your face, just the bat.</p>

        <p>It&#39;s actually a phial. You can unscrew the head and fill the body with any regular potion. If you do so and then leave it out under two consecutive full moons, the potion has double the normal effect in whatever ways the imbiber prefers (duration, strength, whatever makes sense).</p>

        <p>When you call upon the spirit of the bat by placing a drop of your blood on its gemmed tongue roll + CHA.<br /><br />*On a 10+ you turn into a flock of bats and are able to fly in yards as indicted by the dice + your DEX.<br /><br />*On a 7-9, you turn into a flock of bats and can move your DEX in yards, but contract fleas who may or may not carry disease.<br /><br />*On a 6- you summon the original owner of the item. They don&#39;t look very happy at being disturbed. <br /><br />I&#39;ve never played DW but I have the book, stills seems like a really fun game :)</p>

DW style might be more to write it as a limited version of the Druid <b>Shapeshift</b> move, where you can only turn into a swarm of bats.  In addition to being able to fly, you&#39;d probably get action choices like * Navigate in pitch darkness and * Drink blood, and the move speed would be described qualitatively if at all. (DW does not bother keeping track of things in yards.)</p>

        <p>Bats will not attack you unless you attack them while you wear The Rhinestone Bat.<br /><br />When you wear The Rhinestone Bat , roll+Cha. On a 10+, choose 3; on a 7-9, choose 2.<br /><br />- A bat will tell you something useful (nearest treasure, monster,etc.)<br />- You grow small bat wings and gain the ability to &quot;Feather Fall&quot; until you next make camp. All Charisma rolls are -1 when you use this ability.<br />- You grow small  bat ears and gain the ability to &quot;see&quot; in the dark until you next make camp. All Charisma rolls are -1 when you use this ability. Loud noises may blind you (GM rules)<br />- You gain the ability to sleep hanging from a roof or ceiling which acts like the spell &quot;Alarm&quot; when you next make camp. Your comrades will make fun of you.<br />- You can eat a meal of tasty insects and avoid using rations when you next make camp. Yummy!<br /><br />Failure causes you to change into a bat (as per Druid)until your party next makes camp.</p>

        <p>Like <span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink" href="https://plus.google.com/117184575738442924541" oid="117184575738442924541">Christopher Weeks</a></span>, it looked like a phial to me. So here&#39;s an alternative version of a phial (partially stealing from his cool solution).<br /><br />The build up.<br />If you unscrew the bat&#39;s head and fill it&#39;s &quot;tummy&quot; with wine, then leave it out under a two consecutive full moons, it turns into a drinkable potion. When you drink the potion, your hearing becomes extremely sensitive.<br /><br />The move.<br />When you actively listen, after drinking the potion from your bat brooch, roll+WIS: On a 10+ the GM will tell you about a sound beyond the range of normal human hearing that is both interesting and useful. On a 7-9 the GM will tell you about such a sound that is interesting, it is up to you to make it useful. [Default failure (if you don&#39;t have a better idea) - you get blasted by an unexpected sound and become Confused, -1 WIS.]<br /><br />Note that the move is just a specialized Spout Lore, structurally. Though the nature of it is more akin to Discern Realities.</p>

        <p>&quot;Blindman&#39;s Bane&quot; is a strange gem-encrusted bat-like sculpture originally crafted by the Gnomes of the Deep Below the Mountain who had come across that wretched race of underdwellers known as the Morlock. When the tail is pulled down and the head spun counter-clockwise, the sculpture functions as a &quot;Turn Undead&quot; against Morlock creatures, keeping them at bay but certainly making them aware of ones presence. <br /><br />The Morlocks of course gain a chance to resist, and should they resist they will stop at nothing to kill the wielder and smash the sculpture. Their focus is absolute. <br /><br />Which is good in its own twisted way, as master dweomercrafters amongst the Gnomes of the Deep Below the Mountain took note of this unfortunate side-effect and crafted a trigger within the sculpture. Should the &quot;Blindman&#39;s Bane&quot; be shattered it erupts with a massive &quot;Light&quot; spell which has permanence enough to last two hours. This horrid effect may cause some problems to adventurers, but to the grimlocks it is as though the Sun has emerged below the surface of the world and has a 75% of forcing them into retreat in which they will club those who are coated in Light to death in the hopes of snuffing out the light.<br /><br />The Gnome King has one of these afixed his mighty warpick, which has been blessed so as to burst with the fury of the Sun whenever the bat bites at the skin of its morlock foes. The Morlock king Grimgal One-Eye is said to wrap his head due to a strike which has cursed half his face to burn with light. </p>
