Trying to come up with magical items for our new campaign. Is this clear enough?<br /><br />White Glaive of Light		close, 2 weight<br />These broadswords were forged by titans for their wars against the gods. Over the ages most of them have disappeared since they possess the power to strike down even the most powerful of enemies. The swords hold a magical condition: to use them the wielder must perform three heroic acts. If the condition is met and the wielder goes into combat he my use the White Glaive of Light to attack any kind of being as an equal - from gods and titans to smallest of goblins. The sword can wound them all.

        <p>It feels a bit jarring, as if there&#39;s no play event that happens. I&#39;d change it to something like:<br /><br />... In order to wield a Glaive, one must first speak three heroic acts they have performed to the weapon. Only then will they be able to lift it, and the wielder will be able to go into battle against any being as an equal - from gods and titans to smallest of goblins. ...</p>

        <p>I&#39;m alming for a classical mythological item, so I think &quot;can&#39;t use it&quot; should be worded in a way that states it has no magical powers unless the acts are performed. I&#39;ll have to sleep on this, though <span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink" href="https://plus.google.com/103667855585775066713" oid="103667855585775066713">Aaron Griffin</a></span> &#39;s idea sounds quite good at the moment.</p>

        <p>I would say they need to recite a heroic deed the blade deems worthy in order for it to manifest itself every time it is drawn from it&#39;s scabbard. So you can enjoy the players trying to dramatize the time they saved a cat from a tree, or something.<br /><br />If they fail to do so it&#39;s literally just a hilt with no blade.</p>

        <p>Tiny quibble: a glaive is a pole arm, not a side arm.</p>

        <p>To your actual question: the backstory doesn&#39;t seem to jive with how it&#39;s used. Titans are (usually) evil, yet you have to do heroic things to use their god-killing weapons? <br /><br />I would write it simply as, &quot;God-killing Blade: The only weapon that can wound a god, or parry a god&#39;s attack. Naturally, they are closely guarded by their creators, the titans. Recovering even one surely requires a quest befitting the sagas of old.&quot;<br /><br />Then the &quot;heroic deeds&quot; are the quest objectives they undertake to find them.</p>

        <p>From a real world history perspective, it&#39;s a French word likely derived from the Latin gladius (meaning sword). But the only weapons called glaives in historical records were pole arms. <br /><br />The word sounds fanciful enough that it is often applied by modern authors to any manner of bladed weapon.<br /><br />It&#39;s your game, call it what you want. :)</p>

You could also look at their alignment, and have deeds from that. If they&#39;re good they need to do good deeds in order to use the sword, or lawful, ect.</p>

I always tend to forget the alignments since 90% of games I play do not have them (and we also started the game with Funnel World).</p>

        <p>Another try with this:<br /><br /><b>Shining Sword</b>		<i>close, 2 weight</i><br /><i>These broadswords were forged to wage war against the gods. Over the ages most of them have disappeared since they possess the power to strike down even the most powerful of enemies.</i> <br />The shining sword can be used to attack and kill any creature - even gods. Only creatures of Good or Lawful alignment may harness its power but only if they speak a good deed the sword deems worthy. In hands of other alignments or when a good deed is not proclaimed, Shining Sword act only as a regular sword.</p>
