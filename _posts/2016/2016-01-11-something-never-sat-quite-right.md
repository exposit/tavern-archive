Something never sat quite right with me about Volley, so here&#39;s an alternate version (rather harsher overall, although that was not the intent) that I will be trying in my game in the future. Translated from slovene:<br /><br />When you <b>take aim at a target</b>, erase 1 ammo and ask the GM if anything is obstructing your shot or endangering your position. If the answer is no, deal your damage. If the answer is yes, roll +dex. On a 10+ you hit your target and deal damage. On 7-9, choose: <br />°your target avoids the shot, moving to safety<br />°you hit and deal damage, but the danger to your position comes to bear<br />On a 6 or less the usual fuckery.<br /><br />This would require a slight ammo reworking. I haven&#39;t considered the interaction with any class moves yet because I&#39;m working from a WoD chassis up.﻿

        <p>I actually like it, but the first 7-9 option needs to be a success with a cost.﻿ You run into an ammo problem though, as 3 ammo will go insanely quickly. <br /><br />Perhaps you could choose: you only deal half your damage from a glancing blow, you draw attention to yourself, or something else. A third option here would be nice.</p>

        <p>In fact, I would allow the player to reclaim the ammo from the target after it is dead. It might require a DD if during a battle (or not).<br /><br />This could make the third option &quot;the arrow deals full damage but breaks, making it unable to be reclaimed.&quot; Essentially, lose one ammo.</p>

        <p>I like it. The only thing I&#39;d suggest is making this a compendium class move or alternate basic move rather than replacing volley.</p>

        <p>I think the first option counts as a success in many circumstances, it&#39;s the equivalent of a &quot;worse outcome&quot; of a defy danger roll and the whole move is kinda a rewording of a mix of sucker someone and go aggro from Apocalypse World.<br /><br />I will think about it, but it&#39;s hard to say before it hits the table.<br /><br />Ammo defintely wouldn&#39;t work as curently written though, like I said.</p>

        <p>you would be buying into tracking ammo for weapons, which isn&#39;t that big a deal if your players are OK with it.</p>

        <p>I think the ammo worry is avoided by treating this as a secondary move, not a replacement.</p>

        <p>What if you roll because &quot;anything is obstructing your shot&quot;... what would be the danger to suffer in case you chose &quot;danger to your position comes to bear&quot;?<br /><br />What I&#39;m saying is that the trigger contemplates two options, but the second choice is valid only when there is danger, but not for a difficult shot because of your position.<br />Is missing the shot the only option, then?<br /><br />I understand that the 2 options require the player to chose between dealing damage or keeping safe, but in that case the trigger for &quot;obstructing your shot&quot; is maybe not correct. <br />On the other hand, I would hesitate to remove it completely. Dealing damage with no need to roll seems too powerful, so probably as GM there would be the need to invoke a lot of obstructions, even when there is no danger for the character.<br />Bottom line; I would rework a bit the 7-9 list...<br /><br /></p>

A worse outcome, in my eyes, means that you got what you wanted but there is also a bad thing that happens as a result...<br /><br />e.g. You shot at and hit the target, but they dropped the amulet, which shattered against the floor. You needed that to open the portal.</p>

        <p><span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink" href="https://plus.google.com/107700276053510903924" oid="107700276053510903924">Gregor Vuga</a></span>, I see where you&#39;re coming from on &quot;your target avoids the shot, moving to safety&quot; being a partial success, similar to the 7-9 results on go aggro.  The idea is that they take defensive action, and give up the initiative in order to avoid taking damage.  Yeah?<br /><br />But I don&#39;t think that works in the context of the <i>attacker</i> making the choice, especially when the other choice is to put the attacker in danger.  <br /><br />Go Aggro works so well because the <i>target</i> is making the choice, and choosing between suffering the harm you threaten, giving you what you want, or (or a 7-9) doing something defensive that gives up the initiative.  It shapes the conversation in a particular way, because the <i>player</i> triggers the move and rolls, and the <i>target&#39;s player</i> (often the GM) describes the response and then the GM asks &quot;What do you do?&quot;  So it can be like &quot;I open fire, trying to get them to scram!&quot; and roll a 7-9 and the GM&#39;s like &quot;They scatter and dive for cover; one went behind that car, two dove into that old cargo container.  You don&#39;t have a shot on any of them but if they try to move you sure will. What do you do?&quot;<br /><br />I.e. the defending character makes their choice, and the conversation naturally turns back to the attacker and asks &quot;what do you do?&quot;  That&#39;s because (if the defender is an NPC) their choice and the description of it is the MC&#39;s soft move.  <br /><br />But I think the conversation flows differently if the attacker is making the choice. &quot;I draw a bead on the high priest. Anything in way?  Any nearby threats?&quot;  &quot;Nothing in your way, he&#39;s advancing towards you down the temple&#39;s main room, flanked by his two acolytes, eyes shooting daggers at you interlopers. But all those cultists to your left, they&#39;re sure a potential threat.  You take the shot?&quot;  &quot;Sure, that&#39;s 1 ammo down and... crap, a 7.  Um... I don&#39;t want to get swarmed by a pack of cultists, so I guess he moves to safety and I miss the shot?&quot;  &quot;Yeah, okay. He sees you drawing down on him and he darts behind the pillar to your right.&quot;<br /><br /><i>What happens here?</i>  As the GM, I&#39;d consider that description to be describing the players choice.  I don&#39;t <i>think</i> that I&#39;d immediately turn it back to them with &quot;what do you do?&quot; I <b>think</b> I&#39;d probably make a soft move. Like, maybe the high priest starts chanting a spell.  Or maybe the cultists charge. And <i>then</i> ask &quot;what do you do?&quot;  <br /><br />Maybe I&#39;m not right about that, maybe most GMs <i>would</i> ask &quot;what do you do&quot; after describing the high priest moving to cover.  In that case, yeah, 7-9 is definitely a solid result.<br /><br />But even then, there&#39;s a big issue:  the player is getting to dictate the target&#39;s behavior.  What if the target is a mindless zombie?  Or a wizard who thinks himself invulnerable behind his layers of magical wards?  Are they going to move to safety?  I doubt it. But the move doesn&#39;t account for that.</p>

This is probably an even bigger problem, but I believe it is separate from the non-choice that is offered.<br /><br />I can more likely understand a choice that says &quot;miss the shot but offer an ally +1 against the attacker as the target is distracted&quot; or something where I forgo damage but gain something else, either tactical advantage or otherwise.<br /><br />I want my arrow to do something. Distract the target, pin them to a structure, deal damage, or something. I cannot simply think of a situation where I would want to choose to both 1) not deal damage and (2) lose ammo. What am I gaining?</p>

        <p>If the target takes a defensive position and then the GM asks &quot;what do you do&quot; (to you or to another PC), then your arrow <b>does</b> totally gain you something.  It&#39;s suppressive fire. You gain the initiative.<br /><br />But as worded, I don&#39;t think it will necessarily do that. And more importantly, I don&#39;t think the attacker should be the one who decides.<br /><br />Hmm... what about this?<br /><br />When you <b><i>take aim at a distant target</i></b>, ask the GM what&#39;s in the way and what dangers threaten your position. If the answer is &quot;nothing,&quot; spend 1 ammo and deal your damage.  If there&#39;s something in the way or threatening your position and you <b><i>take the shot anyway</i></b> roll+DEX. On a 10+, your shot hits, deal your damage.  On a 7-9, the GM chooses 1:<br /> - You hit and deal damage, but whatever threatened your position comes to bear<br /> - Your target takes cover and hunkers down defensively, taking no damage but ceding the initiative.<br /> - You hit and damage a foe near your target, but not the one you were aiming for</p>

        <p>Because then they&#39;re <i>not doing anything else</i>.  You&#39;re keeping them pinned down, quite possibly while you maneuver for a clear shot (and potentially auto-damage), or your allies do (or do something else that makes this the target&#39;s day suck, like fireball or send in the barbarian).<br /><br />&quot;Suppress and maneuver&quot; is one of the core principles of modern infantry tactics.</p>
