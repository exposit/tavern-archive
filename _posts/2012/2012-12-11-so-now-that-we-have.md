So now that we have the Planarch Codex, what&#39;s some good recommended reading/viewing for it?

        <p>Planescape: Torment, obviously. Greatest CRPG ever made? Quite possibly.</p>

        <p>Hellraiser leaps to mind. So does What Dreams May Come for some reason.</p>

        <p>I recommend some Fafhrd and The Grey Mouser, if you haven&#39;t actually read the original Leiber stories. So good! Mike Mignola&#39;s comic adaptation is also wonderful.<br /><br />Speaking of comics, run don&#39;t walk to find a copy of Elias: The Cursed.</p>

        <p>This is just from a bit of passing familiarity with the actual Planarch Codex and it&#39;s related spinoffs, but since it&#39;s Planescapey, I figure these sources should be a safe bet. All are books unless otherwise noted.<br /><br />The Chronicles of Amber by Roger Zelazny<br />Michael Moorcock&#39;s Eternal Champion stuff, especially Elric<br />Perdido Street Station and<br />The Scar, both by China Mieville<br />Basically any comic by Moebius, especially Arzach.<br />A Wrinkle in Time by Madeleine L&#39;Engle<br />The Dark Chrystal (Movie)<br /><br />EDIT: I second Faffrd and the Grey Mouser, because it&#39;s my mental benchmark for D&amp;D as story, and if anything Dungeon World is more like their adventures than D&amp;D is.</p>

        <p>I was thinking of Perdido Street Station, especially when the main protagonists meet the adventurers:<br /><br />“Apparently, there’s a few serious adventurers in town right now, claiming to have just liberated some major trow haul from the ruins in Tashek Rek Hai. May be up for a little paid work.”<br /><br />Derkhan looked up. Her face creased in distaste. She shrugged unhappily.<br /><br />“I know they are some of the hardest people in Bas Lag,” she said slowly. It took some moments for her to turn her mind to the issue. “I don’t trust them, though. They court danger. And they’re quite unscrupulous graverobbers for the most part. Anything for gold and experience.”</p>

Most were nothing but tomb raiders. They were scum who died violent deaths, hanging on to a certain cachet among the impressionable through their undeniable bravery and their occasionally impressive exploits.”</p>
