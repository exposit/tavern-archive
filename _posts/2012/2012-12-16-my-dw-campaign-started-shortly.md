My DW campaign started shortly after the &quot;Dungeon Starters&quot; collection was released to Kickstarter backers. I ended up creating a Starter inspired by <i>Shadow of the Colossus</i> and <i>Beast Hunters</i>. I just created a version with copyright-legit images, so here for your enjoyment and use: &quot;Valley of the Titans!&quot;
