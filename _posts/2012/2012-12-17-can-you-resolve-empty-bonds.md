Can you resolve empty bonds? Or do they stay as a handicap until I, as the Thief, decide to steal something from the party?

        <p>I&#39;d think if you have an empty bond you can either fill it by stealing something from somebody or planning a long con with them or something, or write a new one to replace it and fill THAT one.</p>

        <p>In games I&#39;ve played in, everyone took at least one starting bond and any unfilled bonds became empty slots which could be used for writing new bonds during play.</p>

        <p>The answer is:<br /><br /><i>«If you have a blank bond left over from character creation </i><b><i>you can assign a name to it or write a new bond in its place whenever you like</i></b><i>. You don’t get an XP for doing so, but you do get more defined bonds to resolve in the future»</i> (p. 32).</p>

        <p>The list of bonds on your character sheet isn&#39;t an exhaustive list, it&#39;s a small sample of <b>suggestions</b> for what would be appropriate as a bond for that character class.<br /><br />You can write anything you want as a bond, as long as the fiction makes sense. A bond that doesn&#39;t have a name is an unwritten bond - it&#39;s nothing at all; you just replace it with an actual bond.</p>

        <p>In fact, look to the &#39;Bonded to the Book&#39; section of the rules for a bunch of really bang up bond examples.</p>

        <p>Yep! I knew bonds weren&#39;t permanent once resolved, I just wasn&#39;t sure what to do with the blank ones. Thanks for the help, everybody!</p>
