Has anybody come up with an Alchemist playbook?  I&#39;ve been messing around with one, but don&#39;t think I have a good enough handle on the game yet to do a full-blown playbook.  I want one for a setting that does not have D&amp;D style wizards, and my attempts have been loosely based on the Monster Blood Tattoo novels.  I&#39;m envisioning a sort of &quot;combat chemist&quot;, a guy who reaches into his satchel of weird alchemical mixtures and pulls out just the right potion/powder/whatever to throw at the monster and achieve a variety of effects.  Below are my attempts at some basic moves for the class, but I&#39;m very open to checking out anyone else&#39;s stab at an Alchemist (BTW - the damages listed are just placeholders until I give them some more thought.  Stores is an abstract measure of alchemical supplies, and I&#39;m thinking you&#39;d start with 5-10 stores, and need to find/buy more pretty quickly).<br /><br />Alchemy<br />When you use an alchemical preparation, roll+DEX:  <br />On a 10+, choose 1, or choose 2 and deplete your stores.<br />On a 7-9, choose 1 and deplete your stores.<br />On a 6-, deplete your stores and you suffer a mishap.<br />-	Create a cloud of noxious vapors<br />-	Create a cloud of thick, obscuring  smoke<br />-	Create a loud explosion (d8+2 damage area)<br />-	Create a pool of dissolving acid (d10+1 damage ignores armor)<br />-	Create a stunningly bright light<br />-	Create a deafening noise<br />-	Put a handful of creatures to sleep<br />-	Catch things on fire<br /><br />Analyze<br />When you have the time and laboratory equipment to investigate a mysterious substance, roll +WIS:<br />On a 10+, choose three<br />On a 7-9, choose 1<br />-	You determine the substance’s components<br />-	You determine the substance’s origin<br />-	You determine the substance’s method of manufacture <br />-	You determine the substance’s usefulness<br /><br />Concoct<br />When you have access to the resources and equipment to make a concoction, roll+INT:<br />On a 10+, choose 1 or choose 2 and deplete your stores.<br />On a 7-9, choose 1 and deplete your stores.<br />On a 6-, deplete your stores and you are left with a useless goo.<br />-	You create a deadly poison (1d6 ongoing damage poison)<br />-	You create a sleeping draught<br />-	You create a powerful antidote (counteract poison)<br />-	You create an invigorating tonic (remove one debility)<br />-	You create a healing balm (heal 2d6 HP)<br />-	You create a boosting potion (+1 forward to one stat modifier for one use)

        <p>I&#39;m not sure if anyone else has done it, but I&#39;ve been contemplating making one (although I feel like I don&#39;t want to start tinkering without some more experience with the base game). I was thinking that I&#39;d take some inspiration from the Hoarder and Savvyhead playbooks from <i>Apocalypse World</i>. For making potions and whatnot I would start with the Savvyhead&#39;s workspace move as a base and adapt it. I also want something akin to the Hoard&#39;s desire to collect new stuff for your collection of supplies. I haven&#39;t worked out exactly how I&#39;d want that to work, but something where you&#39;d roll a 6- and the GM would say things like &quot;You rummage around in your stuff, and you don&#39;t find anything that would work. But do you know what would be perfect for that? A gryphon heart&quot; that would prime you to want to do things.<br /><br />For combat, I was thinking that just saying as starting equipment: &quot;you have Ammo:2 worth of reactive and noxious substances&quot; and just let people describe their actions within the Volley move and let the GM work the consequences appropriate to the fiction. Then I was going to give a &quot;When you vivisect a strange and unusual creature, Roll + INT. On a 10+ hold 3, on a 7-9 hold 1&quot;, with various options to spend the hold, one of which would be &quot;Gain Ammo:1 worth of reactive and noxious substances&quot;. </p>

        <p>I&#39;ve seen the artificer, and I plan to include them as an option, but its not quite what I&#39;m going for with the alchemist.</p>
