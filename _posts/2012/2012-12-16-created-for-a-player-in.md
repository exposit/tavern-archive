Created for a player in my <span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink" href="https://plus.google.com/110347546870177044171" oid="110347546870177044171">Dungeon World</a></span> game tonight:<br /><br /><b>Compendium Class: Greymalkin</b><br /><br />When you <b>befriend and name a small animal during your adventures</b>, you may take this move when you level up:<br /><br /><b>Bonded Familiar</b>: You may write Bonds with your animal friend. Create one immediately upon taking this move. While you maintain at least one Bond with an animal, you can converse with it: you speak plainly and it understands you, and its meows or chirps or grumbles are mystically translated into language in your mind. If the animal undertakes a task for you that triggers a move requiring an attribute roll, it rolls +the number of Bonds you have with it in place of the modifier normally used.<br /><br />Once you&#39;ve taken <i>Bonded Familiar</i>, the following moves count as class moves for you. You may also choose from this list whenever you level up:<br /><br /><b>Witching Whelp</b>: If your familiar rests with you while you <i>Commune</i> or <i>Prepare Spells</i>, it may memorize one spell of its own from your list, of a level up to your level – 2.<br /><br /><b>The Critter Who Walks Through Walls</b>: Your familiar is transformed into a creature of spirit and shadow. It can become insubstantial for a few minutes at a time, and if killed, it melts away into ethereal energy only to return to health by your side the next time you <i>Make Camp</i> or <i>Recover</i>.<br /><br /><b>Opinionated Pet</b>: Anyone who can hear the familiar&#39;s vocalizations understands it as speech, not just you.

        <p>Our Wizard&#39;s familiar Ginger the cat has been in play for a couple of levels now, and it&#39;s great fun! One ambiguity we ran into was the question of whether a familiar without the Opinionated Pet move could understand speech other than its master&#39;s; we ruled yes, but other groups/GMs could decide differently, I&#39;d think.</p>

        <p>Yes, definitely--I&#39;ve had a lot of fun with it. The text is not as clear as I&#39;d like and the layout isn&#39;t fancy, but it&#39;s playable!</p>
