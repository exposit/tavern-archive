So, my <span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink" href="https://plus.google.com/110347546870177044171" oid="110347546870177044171">Dungeon World</a></span> game last night was AWESOME!<br /><br />So, way back in the first session, Hycorax the Druid picked the bond &quot;The spirits spoke to me of a great danger that follows Gretta.&quot; (Gretta is/was a Dwarf Fighter. (I&#39;ll explain is/was in a minute.)) They finally found out what it was.<br /><br />It was an elder beast from the Realm of Shadows sent by the cult that has ousted her from her homeland.<br /><br />The thing was frigging terrifying!<br /><br />Now, they were traveling and Jonah the Ranger automatically succeeds his Undertake A Perilous Journey rolls, so I couldn&#39;t fairly ambush them. Jonah clues in that something is following them, but it keeps vanishing so he circles back to see if he can find some tracks. Blows his Hunt and Track roll, so he&#39;s nowhere near when it attacks.<br /><br />The thing nearly killed Gretta  and also ruined her armor and shield in the process before she and Hycorax managed to drive it off.<br /><br />They spent some time figuring out what it was and what it meant that it was stalking them (apparently the Goddess of Shadows has taken a personal interest in Gretta), and also realized that it was part of a pack...<br /><br />Anyway, they ran into another a few nights later and it finished the job before vanishing into the shadows.<br /><br />However, Gretta hit a 7-9 on her Last Breath move!<br /><br />None of us are sure what the deal she made with Hood (the God of Death) was... But she came back WRONG.<br /><br />I dug out my copy of Number Appearing, and she&#39;s no longer a Dwarf Fighter. She&#39;s still a Fighter, but now she&#39;s one of the Hungry Dead. Her glowing eyes and black fingers mark her as one of Hood&#39;s own, but no one is sure if this is supposed to be a blessing or a curse...<br /><br />Anyway, this game just keeps getting more awesome.

        <p>First post? Well played. &gt;_&gt; But aside from the bad puns, earlier today there was no DW Tavern community to post to, so I think you&#39;re off the hook.</p>

        <p>Hycorax is my favourite Druid name.</p>

        <p>Oh man! I totally forgot to mention that Gretta&#39;s signature weapon is a massive hammer that glows in the presence of undead. Now she can&#39;t make the thing stop glowing!</p>

        <p>Make it glow more. Add some ghost flame. Have it occasionally moan with the voices of the spirits of those it has slain. Makes that downside way more badass &gt;_&gt;</p>

        <p>She also took the power that lets her add magical properties from other items to it and reforged it using parts of a ghost slaying dagger she found. He hammer already has a pretty serious undead vibe... It WOULD be pretty cool to amp that up a bit.<br /><br />Oh, and she went and leveled at the end of that session (Level 7 now!). Can you guess what move she took?</p>
