So here&#39;s my question for the evening: do you all think the game would run OK with just the DM and a PC, or is 2 players the safe minimum?<br /><br />My fiance and I have a 12 hour drive and DMing some DW would keep me sharp for the drive.

        <p>You set the right storyline up and it&#39;ll work fine.</p>

        <p>Let&#39;s see...<br /><br />If she plays a bard or a thief type then you get to pick some city type of adventures such as:<br /><br />-figuring out who framed her for murder.<br />-steal the emerald necklace of Corax before the rival thief gets it as the winner gets admittance into the guild.<br />-while performing in the Copper Cup inn the bard is forced to defend a young boy from ruffians and it turns out the boy needs guard on his way back to the palace as he&#39;s the king&#39;s youngest son who got into a bit of hot water while out &quot;slumming.&quot;<br />-obtain a very rare ingredient that is needed by a priest to heal her companion who was poisoned in their last adventure.<br />-the noble house of Erlik has offered her a chance to investigate an issue at their family crypt as it seems someone (or something) continues to take all flowers from the family graves every night and they need to know why.</p>

        <p>It works great! I&#39;ve really become very fond of single-player play. The crucial thing is to line up opposition that mostly plays to the character&#39;s strengths, and to think about the help you&#39;ll need to provide via NPCs and the environment for the character to face what they&#39;re vulnerable to.<br /><br />&lt;surfer voice&gt;It&#39;s the moves, dude. The moves.&lt;/surfer voice&gt; If your fiancee wants to play a druid, for instance, the enemies should perhaps be something unnatural that the local animals know of but the settlements in the area dismiss, and that perhaps have a cthonic power of shapeshifting, requiring the druid to shapeshift repeatedly to match them.<br /><br />And so on.</p>

        <p>You can do fun stuff in single-player games like adjusting the rate of time, too. Say there&#39;s a foe who appears each Midsummer&#39;s Eve. The PC has their first encounter with it. Then you take a few minutes to talk about the year passing. Then the next encounter. And so on. :)</p>

        <p>Solo (as in, one-on-one) games work fine with other systems, so why shouldn&#39;t they with DW?</p>
