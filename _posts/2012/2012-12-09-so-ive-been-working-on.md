So I&#39;ve been working on a thing lately. Behold Dungeon World Dark Sun!<br /><br /><a href="https://drive.google.com/?tab=mo&amp;authuser=0#folders/0BwQBDcsLI0e-ZVVzeGRFR2pxUW8" class="ot-anchor">https://drive.google.com/?tab=mo&amp;authuser=0#folders/0BwQBDcsLI0e-ZVVzeGRFR2pxUW8</a><br /><br />Classes doc is the Dark-Sun-ized versions of the core DW classes. Mostly it&#39;s new blurbs, racial/alignment moves, and bonds, but there are also some new moves and stuff swapped around between classes (e.g. the bard gets the thief&#39;s poison-related moves, while the thief gets... something I haven&#39;t decided yet).<br /><br />Gladiator doc is a new class. Big thanks to the folks over on the Something Awful Traditional Games forum for constructive feedback, suggestions, and sanity checks.<br /><br />Misc. Stuff is currently just a junk doc, a place to put ideas that come to me so I don&#39;t forget them.

        <p>Looks intriguing. I particularly like the Defiler move.</p>

        <p>Funnily enough, realizing that defiling was a <b>perfect</b> fit for a 7-9 choice on the cast a spell move was what kicked off this project in the first place.</p>

        <p>Absolutely. Such a subtle hack can evoke the Dark Sun feel.</p>

        <p>And the classes are now at beta. Latest changes:<br /><br />* Full writeups for every class. Most of that, of course, is copy/paste from Dungeon World, but all classes have Dark Sun appropriate Names, Looks, and Gear, and several have had moves tweaked or refluffed for Dark Sun.<br />* Tweaked Gladiator&#39;s Names and Looks<br />* Moved Gladiator into the Classes doc.<br />* Added chatchka and gythka as armament options for all classes with a thri-kreen move.<br />* Changed Gladiator&#39;s Mano-a-Mano move (it now reads like the rules for Serpent&#39;s Tears poison).<br />* Changed Gladiator&#39;s Rope-a-Dope move to allow for increased bastardry. It now negates the -1 ongoing penalty for breaking the Mano-a-Mano code and gives +1 forward to the first of your allies to sucker punch your chosen foe.<br />* Added mul racial move to the Templar class and added an extra Bond.<br />* Moved all the thief&#39;s poison-related moves to the bard, replacing arcane art and the advanced moves that upgrade it.<br />* Added 5 new thief moves to replace the poison-related moves the bard stole: Forger; One Riot, One Rascal; Alley Rat; Escape Artist; and Guild Master.<br /><br />Comments are, of course, very welcome and much appreciated.</p>

        <p>OK, finally got around to reading this. Great work! Just a couple of things:<br /><b>Cleric</b> : Says Dwarf for names, but has Elf racial powers, No half-giant names<br /><br /><b>Fighter</b>: Has Dwarf names listed twice, one should be Mul?<br />    To me the Gladiator was always a weapons master, in the original     DS boxed set, fighters were more like warlords, I may change their signature weapon power to a more commanding or warlord like power.<br /><br /><b>Templar</b>, no Neutral alignment? &quot;The will of the King protects the people&quot;.  no spells?<br /><br /><b>Wizard</b> Love the defiling, I also feel like it should be a move as well to defile on purpose!<br /><br />Looks like two more classes are need to my eye, the Dune Trader and the Psion.<br /><br />Also, maybe give every class a minor Wild Talent move? <br /><br />Great job with this. I think I&#39;ll be using it for a DS DW game soon!</p>

(FYI, at some point since the original post, I migrated the Gladiator into the Classes doc, so that&#39;s the most currently up-to-date.)<br /><br />As far as license, it&#39;s all totally as Creative Commons as anything that&#39;s a wholesale lift from IP I don&#39;t own can be. So feel free to mod away! I know at some point I did the same thing, but for the life of me I can&#39;t remember where I wrote up the traditional DW take on the gladiator. If I find it, I&#39;ll let you know.</p>
