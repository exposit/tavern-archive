While I know Dungeon World is meant for more unstructured play I am tempted to run Ptolus in Dungeon World because I love the setting so much. Sure a lot of the dungeons/groups/etc. might already be well defined but doesn&#39;t mean there isn&#39;t room for more of the organic DW play as well.

        <p>I&#39;ve really really wanted to play Ptolus using DW. Feel like I want to get something out of that big beautiful book.</p>

        <p>I ran it in D&amp;D 3.5 for a few months and then we switched to Savage Worlds with it for almost a year before that campaign ended. It was a great time.<br /><br />Tried it in 4E but wasn&#39;t really feeling 4E so that died quickly. I think a lot of the politics, mystery, groups, etc. could be fun to play out in DW.</p>

        <p>I&#39;m finding that well-defined places in old modules work out fine in DW. I just have more inputs in considering how to apply my moves. :D</p>
