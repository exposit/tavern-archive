How would you go about making a World of Warcraft like Warlock?  Taking a wizard and removing something and sticking on the Ranger&#39;s companion but making it a demon?  Any advice would be nice.  =)

        <p>The Ranger&#39;s companion serves pretty much without compensation. Might warlock pets require some cost, like those shards (if I remember WoW correctly).</p>
