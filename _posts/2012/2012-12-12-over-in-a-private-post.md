Over in a private post, I mentioned that I&#39;m really hankering for a play-by-post Dungeon World game.  Does anyone have one going?  Has anyone done one sucessfully in the past?<br /><br />Is anyone interested in playing in or running one now?

        <p>I was wondering if it could work, actually</p>

        <p>Do you foresee specific problems?<br /><br />I think the move-by-move nature could really lend itself to a string of posts, and the ability to stop and think for a little while might encourage interesting moves.</p>

        <p>It&#39;s a bit difficult to understand when a session ends, for starters. Also it will be incredibly long, and it will lack the spontaneity of the tabletop.<br /><br />We could always try, anyway.</p>

        <p>Hmm, the session ending is a good point.  Maybe still set a real-time cap?  Like, a session is three days or a week or something?  Then, if you used a Community, each session could be a post.<br /><br />Length of time involved and keeping momentum up significant in any PbP--I&#39;ve been in a couple that have fizzled and a couple that have kept on for way longer than they had any right to.<br /><br />Sounds like you may be interested?</p>

        <p>Any preference to play or run?  I&#39;d prefer to avoid DMing, as I haven&#39;t looked through the most recent edition very carefully, but we can see what happens when we get more people together.</p>

        <p>I was waiting the paper book to read carefully though it, but since I&#39;m entitled to the pdf I&#39;ll try to read it.</p>

        <p>I&#39;m interested as well. I have heard good things about DW, but haven&#39;t played it and don&#39;t own it yet. The latter is easy to correct.</p>

        <p>Okay, so <span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink" href="https://plus.google.com/109233332842043539174" oid="109233332842043539174">Chuck Durfee</a></span> and <span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink" href="https://plus.google.com/108416022078683487513" oid="108416022078683487513">Shannon Lane</a></span> have both expressed interest, but neither have played before.  Matteo, I know I&#39;ve seen you talk about Monsterhearts and such--have you run DW before?  It looks like it will be you or I DMing.<br /><br />Three or four PCs might be the sweet spot, too, so we have less a chance of getting hung up waiting for someone to make a move.</p>

        <p>I&#39;d be interested in trying it out but I also have never played before.</p>

        <p>I&#39;d be interested also, but I&#39;m in the same boat where I was waiting for paper to read the new version.  I could move the PDF up on my reading list though if there were a game available.  What kind of time-commitment are we expecting?  I&#39;m probably good for one or two posts per day on weekdays mostly when the sun is up in the middle of North America.<br /><br />Also, I did play a much earlier PBP game but it didn&#39;t last and wasn&#39;t particularly fun.  I&#39;m hoping to see big improvements.  :)</p>

        <p>I think we are almost complete in my game. We have <span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink" href="https://plus.google.com/108920141388510066880" oid="108920141388510066880">Parker D Hicks</a></span>, +Chuck Durfee, me and +Shannon lane.<br /><br />I don&#39;t think I can manage other players, I&#39;m sorry! But I&#39;m sure there will be other players interested, so you could make another group. :)</p>

        <p>I find that DW is one of the games that works pretty well as a PbF.  Below are some of the PbFs that you could use as examples.<br /><br /><a href="http://rpggeek.com/thread/844931/ic-dungeon-world-preventing-tentacle-embrace-is/page/1" class="ot-anchor">http://rpggeek.com/thread/844931/ic-dungeon-world-preventing-tentacle-embrace-is/page/1</a><br /><br /><a href="http://snailspace.forgreatjustice.net/index.php?TagFilter=98" class="ot-anchor">http://snailspace.forgreatjustice.net/index.php?TagFilter=98</a><br />(threads marked &#39;DW&#39; are one game, threads marked &#39;Dungeon World&#39; are separate game [DW Basic])<br /><br /><a href="http://forums.somethingawful.com/showthread.php?threadid=3503288" class="ot-anchor">http://forums.somethingawful.com/showthread.php?threadid=3503288</a><br /><br />I recommend playing with a slightly looser hand on the reigns.  Trust you players to say what they&#39;re doing, choose an appropriate move, roll it, and make any choices on their own (you can always correct them if need be) - you&#39;ll be turning 4 posts (perhaps 4 days) into 1 post and keep the fiction moving.  Players too, go with the flow.  Make it easy for one person to say, &quot;I lead the party into the room,&quot; or other trivial actions, again, you&#39;re all friends and 1 post is better than 4.</p>
