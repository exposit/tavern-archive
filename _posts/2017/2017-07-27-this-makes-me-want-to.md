This makes me want to pick up an old project I had in mind, of making culturally inspired &quot;playsets&quot; with maps, tweaked playbooks, monsters, magic items, and related resources (names lists, social structures, etc.).<br /><br />But I&#39;ve got other things to do. So someone get on this, please.<br /><br />Or just enjoy the awesome Slavic-pagan-goth photoshoot.

When you think of Slavic culture, the first things that come to mind are probably vodka, fur hats, and the Orthodox church. Polish photographer Marcin Nagraba, however, wanted to show the world a more ancient view of his Slavic roots - by dialing it all the way back to Pagan times.

        <p>I mean, I&#39;m kind of doing that?  I&#39;m currently working on a campaign that&#39;s somewhere in the thematic territory of the West Marches / Stonetop, but in a setting more derived from Han-Dynasty China, Feudal Japan, and South-East Asia.</p>
