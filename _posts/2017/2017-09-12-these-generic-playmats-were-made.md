These generic playmats were made to keep track of anything you could need, from 0 to 99 points. Print, cut and use them with paper clips. No need for erasing and writing all over your sheet again and again until there is only a hole where your HP was supposed to be.<br /><br />You can also write down your character name and which stats are being handled in each playmat, as well as the maximum value possible inside the beast&#39;s mouth - or the circle, if you prefer.<br /><br />This playmat is a great tool to keep track of health and sanity points, energy points (such as mana, willpower, blood, effort), penalties (fatigue, paradox, fear) and any other stats you can think of. <br /><br />&gt;&gt; Available on &quot;Pay What You Want&quot; on DriveThru RPG: <a href="http://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/221405/Elders-Playmat-v1--A-00-to-99-Generic-Counter" class="ot-anchor">http://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/221405/Elders-Playmat-v1--A-00-to-99-Generic-Counter</a>
