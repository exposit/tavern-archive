A while back my group of once-newbie players, with me as their once-newbie DM, after fifteen sessions spanning almost two years of wallclock time finally finished their ongoing Dungeon World campaign. <br /><br />The secret of the Order of the Green Cape was revealed, the Dragon of Light manifested in our Ranger&#39;s incontinent Eagle companion (don&#39;t ask), and the attempted return of the blood-god Groth was successfully thwarted.<br /><br />Throughout those two years the Dungeon World Tavern has been my lifeline. I&#39;ve posted questions and asked for advice here so many many times, and you folks never failed to come through for me and help me out with the difficult bits. On behalf of myself and my players I thank you deeply -- all of you please take +1 going forward. :-)<br /><br />We&#39;re taking a break from DW now, and have started a D&amp;D 5E campaign (boo, hiss!), just to see how a slightly more mechanistic approach to RPG&#39;ing compares to the storytelling-focused DW way of doing things. This time, I will simply get to play a PC and won&#39;t need to worry my head with keeping things running smoothly.<br /><br />At some point I will undoubtedly return to DW, though -- I really like the game, and I really like being DM for it. Until then I think I will still continue to hang out in this Tavern even if I&#39;m not actively playing DW. I just kinda like the atmosphere...<br />

        <p>Two ideas to help the RP side of D&amp;D 5e:<br /><br />1) Play a &quot;strangers game&quot;. Players don&#39;t show each other their character sheets, players don&#39;t build their characters together (for that perfect party), and the DM privately gives players some info (the players choose if they share, how much, when, lie, etc...)<br /><br />2) Ask the DM if everyone can get a few extra RP related Cantrips.<br /><br />A combat heavy game can be played on Discord pretty well.  With the smartphone app, it is more like play by text message and can be very fast!<br /><br />I was in 3 persistent world games with 5+ DMs and 30+ players using D&amp;D 5e over Discord.  The servers are still up but I don&#39;t have time.</p>
