Here&#39;s a Monk I made.<br /><br />Lots of other Monk playbooks I&#39;ve found seem to focus on a flow mechanic with a running tally of flow points &amp; an emphasis on WIS. I like that idea but I thought I&#39;d build something based on martial arts stances, a little more similar to the Arcane Duelist&#39;s techniques. I&#39;ve definitely taken some stuff from other Monk playbooks, all of which come up on a google search so consider that my plagiarism statement.<br /><br />I don&#39;t know if I expect anyone else to use this but maybe you&#39;ll steal from it, the same way I stole from other people&#39;s ideas. Here are a few notes anyway.<br /><br />The Vow of Poverty is key to this class - no picking up sweet loot but rather power comes from within. Some of the the Advanced Moves are pretty powerful but they&#39;re designed to balance the fact that you can&#39;t wield any magic swords or armour etc.<br /><br />I am aware that I&#39;ve broken one of the basic principles of Dungeon World but I thought it was necessary. Normally you should never roll twice for a single action. I&#39;ve put an INT roll in addition to the STR Hack &amp; Slash roll for the Last Airbender move. I did this for a couple of reasons. First, this move is pretty powerful so there needed to have some risk similar to the way Wizards or Clerics can &#39;forget&#39; spells but I still wanted to tie it to a physical Strength-based action. Secondly I thought it was important to force the character to spread their points a bit so they couldn&#39;t just min/max with a couple of strong stats. STR &amp; DEX are already obvious strengths for this class so it&#39;s important to force the character to branch out to balance the power of this move, especially it&#39;s level 8+ upgrade.<br /><br />I stayed away from a WIS build for a couple of reasons too. Wisdom kind of represents magic in DW with the Wizard &amp; Cleric already being classes that will have that strength. I want to differentiate inner strength &amp; being in touch with the flow of the universe from magic. Intelligence feels like a very under-utilised stat so I thought it would be good to build a class that can bring that strength to the party with Spout Lore &amp; quick thinking. Also, I had a character in mind &amp; I really like the idea of a young character who thinks he is very wise but actually has a low Wisdom stat (you remember being a teenager &amp; thinking you know everything, right?).<br /><br />I&#39;m about to playtest this sheet in an upcoming campaign, starting in a couple of days. I&#39;ve GM&#39;d a couple of campaigns now &amp; one of my players is stepping up to the plate so that I can actually experience being a PC. I&#39;ve worked with him to get the &quot;OK&quot; to play this sheet so hopefully I&#39;ve got the balance right &amp; I won&#39;t mop the floor with his monsters or outshine the other PCs too much.<br /><br />This is the version I&#39;m going to play but I&#39;d still appreciate any comments since it&#39;s my first custom class. If you&#39;re going to steal from me, let me know what you liked &amp; didn&#39;t or if you do play this sheet, let me know how it goes.

        <p>No expert here, but I like it. It still feels a little bare. I feel like most playbooks have more social/miscellaneous moves that this doesn&#39;t.</p>

        <p>I really enjoyed reading this, assuming its open for anyone I plan to add it to my game as a playable option. Unless you feel otherwise.</p>

Also, i am sure you might have meant cleric and druid depend on wisdom. Because the wizard depends on intelligence for magic.</p>

Anyway, my reasons stand but it could be swapped for WIS if you felt it fits better.</p>

        <p>Its your class so stick to what you envision. Just in my mind monks aren&#39;t extremely smart, but they are extremely wise. For what good is a monk that can&#39;t perceive, yet meditates. (Discern Realities). <br /><br />Edit: Again i love the class as is, just seems like Wisdom would work well with his build in design as oppose to intelligence.</p>
