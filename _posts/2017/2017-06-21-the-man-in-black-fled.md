The man in black fled across the desert, and the gunslinger followed...<br /><br />Another version of the Dark Tower Gunslinger...<br /><br />Found another Gunslinger base class posted on the internet for Dungeon World Dark Tower fans. No idea of author or author but kudos!<br /><br />See what you think...

        <p>It&#39;s much better than the last version.<br /><br />I almost wonder if you shouldn&#39;t drop the HP down to 6+CON, to give the class even more of a glass cannon feel.<br /><br />I&#39;m a bit concerned that all the starting moves are combat focused, even the Fighter has Bend Bars, Lift Gates. I wonder if you shouldn&#39;t just drop Grit, and then maybe turn the uncanny dodge (take +1 to dodge projectiles) and rapid fire (spend 1 ammo to hit a second nearby target) choices into moves.<br /><br />IMO, the racial moves could use some work. The Dwarf is worded a a little strangely... do you mean &quot;When you H&amp;S with a firearm, take +1.&quot;? Since Gnomes are often tinkerers, maybe they could start with +1 attachment or something to reflect this.<br /><br />You left out any ranged tags for the guns. Also, shouldn&#39;t they be reload? Grit talks about unjamming your weapon, but there isn&#39;t anything indicating that it is prone to jamming.<br /><br />I think you need to include guidance on how crafting works. Gunsmithing should maybe include a sentence like, &quot;The GM will tell you what you will need, what it will cost, and how long it will take to craft something.&quot;<br /><br />What is salt shot?</p>

I didn&#39;t write these playbooks, I&#39;ve been finding them on the web and posting them with the idea of doing my own version using the the web feedback for help and inspiration (playbooks I find difficult to write)...you&#39;re help is very much appreciated.</p>
