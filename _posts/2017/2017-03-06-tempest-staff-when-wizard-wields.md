<b>Tempest Staff</b><br /><br />When wizard wields the Tempest Staff with skill<br />To bind a living creature in your sight,<br />You may succeed, and bind it to your will<br />Or else will fail and meet a grievous plight.<br /><br />Add 2d6 to your INT as your score<br />And if the score exceeds or equals seven<br />Then creature fell will hesitate before<br />Attacking you or any of your brethren<br /><br />And if your score exceeds or equals ten,<br />A gift will living creature then bestow<br />Its special move will be within your ken<br />To use one time against another foe.<br /><br />But if a six or less, you do receive<br />Then all stored moves within the staff must leave.<br /><br /><br />Rather than add a clarifying stanza, I will keep this one a sonnet and clarify in prose.<br /><br />Roll INT+2d6<br /><br />A 7+ will prevent a creature from attacking you or your party until your next move.  You can choose to do nothing, and keep this creature at bay as long as you are conscious.<br /><br />A 10+ will steal a special move from the creature, chosen by the DM.  You may use this special move one time, but using it returns it to the creature.<br /><br />The wielder can return the move to the creature at any time without using it.<br /><br />The staff will hold one special move for each bonus point to the wielderâ€™s INT.  If it is transferred to someone with a lower INT, special moves are removed until the previous statement is true.<br /><br />If the wielder rolls 6 or less, then all stored moves are removed from the staff.<br />
