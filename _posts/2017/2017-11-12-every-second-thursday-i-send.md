Every second Thursday I send out cool Dungeon World content I&#39;ve found in the Dungeon World Newsletter - <a href="http://dungeonworldnewsletter.com" class="ot-anchor">http://dungeonworldnewsletter.com</a> . I then try to post it to reddit and the G+ community on Fridays.<br /><br />----------<br /><br /><b>NPC Voice Types</b>: <a href="https://technicalgrimoire.com/files/NPC_Voices.pdf" class="ot-anchor">https://technicalgrimoire.com/files/NPC_Voices.pdf</a>  <br />by David Schirduan: <a href="https://technicalgrimoire.com/" class="ot-anchor">https://technicalgrimoire.com/</a><br />This is a one page PDF helper with different voice types and vocal tics you can use for your NPCs, such as &quot;Uhm, Uh&quot;, &quot;Repeats Last Word Twice&quot;, and &quot;Aged, Wizened.&quot;<br />----------<br /><br /><b>d100 NPC Physical Traits</b>: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DnDBehindTheScreen/comments/7aecn5/d100_npc_physical_traits/" class="ot-anchor">https://www.reddit.com/r/DnDBehindTheScreen/comments/7aecn5/d100_npc_physical_traits/</a>  <br />The /r/d100 community built this table with 100 physical traits you can give your NPCs.<br />----------<br /><br /><b>The Sorcerer: A Mana-based Replacement for the Wizard</b>: <a href="https://plus.google.com/+YochaiGalUSA/posts/EBguats1bg1" class="ot-anchor">https://plus.google.com/+YochaiGalUSA/posts/EBguats1bg1</a>  <br />by yochaigal: <a href="https://plus.google.com/+YochaiGalUSA" class="ot-anchor">https://plus.google.com/+YochaiGalUSA</a>
_&quot;Here&#39;s my final take on the Wizard playbook (now called the Sorcerer); it uses Vancian spells and a MANA mechanic that mimics the way AMMO works.&quot; - yochaigal_<br />----------<br /><br /><b>Divine Justice Playbook Bundle: 6 DW Classes</b>: <a href="http://drivethrurpg.com/product/224842/Divine-Justice-Dungeon-World-Playbook-Bundle?=affiliate_id=815382" class="ot-anchor">http://drivethrurpg.com/product/224842/Divine-Justice-Dungeon-World-Playbook-Bundle?=affiliate_id=815382</a>  <br />by Pleb Publishing: <a href="http://drivethrurpg.com/browse/pub/6168/Pleb-Publishing?=affiliate_id=815382" class="ot-anchor">http://drivethrurpg.com/browse/pub/6168/Pleb-Publishing?=affiliate_id=815382</a><br /><b>USD $4.99</b>  <br /><br />The six playbooks included are: The Solar Executioner, The Plague Caller, The Israfil, The Hunting Priest, The Hototo, and the The Encrowned. There isn&#39;t a preview of the PDF but the descriptions of the classes sound pretty cool.<br />----------<br /><br /><b>The Broken Demon: A Dungeon World Adventure</b>: <a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/broken-demon-15120201" class="ot-anchor">https://www.patreon.com/posts/broken-demon-15120201</a>  <br />by Joe Banner: <a href="https://www.patreon.com/jbinc" class="ot-anchor">https://www.patreon.com/jbinc</a>
_&quot;This is a pretty straightforward adventure that got more straightforward the more I worked on it. The adventure front is still there, but the core of the adventure - the demon and what it does to the populace living above it - got flipped around a bit in development. Anyway, hope you like it!&quot; = Joe Banner_<br />----------<br /><br /><b>New DW Podcast: Spout Lore</b>: <a href="http://spoutlore.com/" class="ot-anchor">http://spoutlore.com/</a>  <br />This is a new actual play podcast for Dungeon World with inexperienced players. The description on the site is: &quot;A series of comedy bits, loosely connected by dice rolls. Join a well-meaning barbarian, a mysterious druid, and an orphaned halfling child as they try to figure out the world they&#39;re in.&quot; There are currently 3 episodes that have been released.<br />----------<br /><br /><b>Adventure Location: The Shattered Gate</b>: <a href="http://blog.trilemma.com/2017/10/the-shattered-gate.html" class="ot-anchor">http://blog.trilemma.com/2017/10/the-shattered-gate.html</a>  <br />by Sean Winslow &amp;amp; Michael Prescott: <a href="https://plus.google.com/+MichaelPrescott" class="ot-anchor">https://plus.google.com/+MichaelPrescott</a><br />This two page PDF includes a labeled map of the location and descriptions and hooks for its various sections. The area is described as &quot;a swampy forest sits within a valley that is avoided by hunters and travellers, as much for its unhealthy air as for the strange and disturbing mutated creatures that inhabit it. Far below the ground, a magical spell engine pulses with arcane energy, distorting the animals of the forest.&quot;<br />----------<br /><br /><b>Monthly Monster: The Prisoner in Darkness</b>: <a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/october-2017-15119909" class="ot-anchor">https://www.patreon.com/posts/october-2017-15119909</a>  <br />by Johnstone Metzger: <a href="https://www.patreon.com/johnstone" class="ot-anchor">https://www.patreon.com/johnstone</a>
_&quot;The Prisoner in Darkness is a vile gnome, jailed in some arcane dimension for millenia, desperate to escape. Will you help Ladrozz the blood caster, summoner of monsters, escape? Or will you end his imprisonment more... permanently?&quot; - Johnstone_<br />----------<br /><br /><b>Codex: Beasts</b>: <a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/codex-beasts-15142859" class="ot-anchor">https://www.patreon.com/posts/codex-beasts-15142859</a>  <br />by The Gauntlet: <a href="https://www.patreon.com/gauntlet" class="ot-anchor">https://www.patreon.com/gauntlet</a><br /><b>USD $4+ patrons only</b>  <br /><br />This edition of Codex has some unique vampires, a Gumberoo monster, and of course thirty six NPC smells.<br />
