I have a Class Warfare question.<br /><br />One of my players is a Sharpshooter/Bounty Hunter/Captain. We’ve only had one session so far and he asked to rejig his character stats, which I usually do.<br /><br />He was hoping to take Arsenal instead of Captain, but to make it for crossbow ammunition instead of melee weapons. He likes his dwarf’s ability to fight at range, likes being a morally dubious bounty hunter but doesn’t feel he’ll get that much use out of his gang.<br /><br />Has anyone adjusted the Arsenal to be ranged? Will it stack okay with the Sharpshooter? <br /><br />I’ve yet to hack a Class Warfare Class, so I’m a little cautious about doing this.

        <p>I might treat each bolt he pulls like a throwing dagger, i.e. he has to retrieve it each time or it&#39;s gone. But you can let him pull a bundle of &quot;standard&quot; bolts (3 ammo) instead of a unique one too to offset that a bit. He will have a bunch of normal shots, but when he specifically pulls a &quot;2 piercing&quot; bolt it&#39;s unique, and he&#39;ll either have to retrieve it or take -1 stock. Just thinking aloud.</p>

        <p>The Elf racial move for the Arsenal turns it into a primarily ranged class, so it should work fine.</p>

        <p>In <i>Fourth World</i>, the Archer discipline has quite a bit of the “<i>Class Warfare</i> but for ranged” DNA in it.</p>

        <p>Hacking panic is over for now. The player figured he’d give his crew one more session to sort themselves out and he enjoyed using them this time. He’ll stick as a Captain, but these are useful things to know if he wants to Compendium into Arsenal or anything.</p>
