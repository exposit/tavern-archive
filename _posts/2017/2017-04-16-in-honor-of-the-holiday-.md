"Gimme that old time religion,
Gimme that old time religion,
Gimme that old time religion,
It's good enough for me!
Montezuma liked to start out
Rites by carrying a part out
That would really tear your heart out,
And it's good enough for me."

"Gimme that old time religion,
Gimme that old time religion,
Gimme that old time religion,
It's good enough for me!
It was good enough for Kali;
Though embracing her is folly,</a>
