<a rel="nofollow" class="ot-hashtag" href="https://plus.google.com/s/%23DungeonWorld/posts">#DungeonWorld</a> <a rel="nofollow" class="ot-hashtag" href="https://plus.google.com/s/%23Kazarak/posts">#Kazarak</a> <a rel="nofollow" class="ot-hashtag" href="https://plus.google.com/s/%23Plundergrounds/posts">#Plundergrounds</a><br /><br />This is the final version of my Escaping Kazarak Encounter Checklist.<br /><br />In play it worked really well and took the party about an hour and fifteen minutes to blast, rapid fire, through nine of the total eleven encounters due to the luck, or lack thereof, of their dice rolls.<br /><br />I am glad that I went this route for the cataclysmic final battle between the dwarf titan and the Eyrok demon because the players were more invested in the outcome. This may be due to the fact that they are mostly in their earlier teens and preteen years.<br /><br />Again, I was going for the idea that the battle between the titan and the demon was raging all over the gigantic underground city of Kazarak, destroying the path that they had used to enter the city. This checklist gave me a chance to switch focus between the battle raging around them and the current encounters that they were stumbling upon as they tried to make their escape. <br /><br />I am working on a full session report (the outline and my basic notes are finished) and will post it to my website, and link it here, when I complete it.
