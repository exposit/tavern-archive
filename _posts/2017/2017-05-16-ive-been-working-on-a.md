I&#39;ve been working on a cardshark playbook for a few days that&#39;s based around unconventionally using playing and tarot cards and I&#39;m wondering if anyone here thinks that it&#39;s a good idea. Think like this: <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/main/thegambler" class="ot-anchor">tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/main/thegambler</a> in terms of inspiration. I&#39;m going to post my WIP version here once I finish the 6+ moves.

The gambler follows a card (or dice) theme, uses cards, dice, darts, coins and gambling implements as weapons, and is very well-versed in blackjack, poker, â€¦

        <p>I think it&#39;s a really cool idea! It would make a fun addition to urban games. It might run into some trouble if the party wants to focus on adventuring and the gambler always wants to return to town where their skills are more relevant.</p>

        <p>I like the idea of a character that is something like a Psi-knife/Oracle/?? except original if you can avoid using Class Warfare.</p>

        <p>I actually do not own Class Warfare so it might be hard for me to use it.</p>

        <p>All the better, because then the class will be original :D<br /></p>

        <p>That sounds really cool. A character could fling cards like throwing cards or use them like a shield (fanning out a bunch of cards), and you could do something like &quot;uncontrolled magic&quot; where you draw an actual card from a deck and use its suit for the effect (Heart = Healing or Charming, Clubs = Damage Spell or Creature Summoning, Diamond = Resources or <i>something</i>, Spades = <i>two other things I can&#39;t think of</i>) and the rank replaces the roll.<br /><br />That&#39;s probably taking things too far, but it would be pretty interesting LOL.</p>

You might also look over stuff like Castle Falkenstein for inspiration along that vein.</p>

        <p>Okay, I&#39;ll try to incorporate something along those lines, probably in some of the advanced moves. But this is my first attempt to make a playbook so it&#39;s probably going to be pretty rubbish.</p>

        <p>I was informed that two of my playbooks were rubbish (Innkeeper, Peasant King), but not here. Over on a discord group. Also the guy didn&#39;t touch the third (Wench). My speculation is not incorporating enough of his ideas.</p>

Even if (especially if) you are just learning how to tinker with the mechanical parts of DW. I bet three things will happen.<br /><br />1.	You will get feedback on your creation that changes the way you think about playbooks. You will probably get feedback that changes the way you think about DW. I sure have.<br /><br />2.	People will find something cool in your playbook and use it in their games. They might try the whole thing or just part of it but you will have given them something.<br /><br />3.	You will walk away with a better playbook and some great ideas for building your next one.<br /><br /><span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink" href="https://plus.google.com/101824580455031797035" oid="101824580455031797035">Brian Holland</a></span> is right.
