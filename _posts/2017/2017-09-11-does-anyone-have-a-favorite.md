Does anyone have a &quot;favorite&quot; GM Move? My favorite is <b>Put someone in a spot</b>. I think tough choices really drive and/or reveal character, and I love to see how my players deal with them.<br /><br />My most recent use (several months ago now, unfortunately) resulted when the thief missed a DD roll while attempting to sneak into an Orc camp to recover something the tribe had stolen. As he made his way through the camp he rounded a corner and two orc children playing in the mud with rocks looked up at him and he froze. He REALLY didn&#39;t want to kill the children, but knew he had to deal with them so they wouldn&#39;t betray his presence. At one point he even considered bolting and resorting to &quot;Plan B&quot; which was a full assault of the camp by the entire party.<br /><br />In the end, not wanting to harm children (despite them being orcs), he poured all three doses of his Oil of Tagit onto his last 2 rations (I let them be apples instead &quot;rations&quot;) and offered them to the pair who gobbled them up instantly. The children quickly fell asleep and he carried them out of sight.<br /><br />I later got to &quot;Think Offscreen&quot; and have the children wake and sound the alarm when I was given a Golden Opportunity <i>right</i> as the thief was grabbing the jeweled sword he was there to recover. <b>END OF SESSION</b>. I can&#39;t wait to pick up there when (IF) we get to continue! He doesn&#39;t know it yet, but the alarm will draw the other orcs away from his position, making his escape easier.<br /><br />Anyway, that&#39;s my favorite and why. Does anyone else have a &quot;favorite&quot; that they use often?

        <p>Give this a choice, with or without a cost, and ask.</p>

        <p>I&#39;m glad you&#39;re angling for the alarm to draw the orcs away from his position. If not, the lesson the player would take away is that he should&#39;ve just killed the children -- and that would bother me, if I were the player.</p>

I&#39;m rewarding him for not killing them, but he doesn&#39;t know that yet because we ended the session right as the alarm went off!</p>

        <p>And I&#39;m glad you mentioned that <span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink" href="https://plus.google.com/114565208078196505939" oid="114565208078196505939">Charles Gatz</a></span>. When all is said and done I want to make sure he realizes that THAT&#39;S why they&#39;re being drawn away. It&#39;s clear in my mind, but I need to put some thought into making sure he knows knows that, even if it&#39;s something like the children pointing in the wrong direction (because they&#39;re young and were just knocked out)...</p>

        <p>I&#39;ve been trying out a &quot;writer&#39;s room approach&quot;, after hearing it discussed in The Gauntlet community. Having a fictional way to convey that knowledge would be best, but if you can&#39;t think of a way to make sense, maybe just mention it, like, &quot;Unless you [player] can think of a fictionally appropriate way your character would know this, I&#39;m just going to say that this is player knowledge, and I liked how you handled that situation.&quot;</p>

        <p>My favorite move would have to be &quot;Show signs of an approaching threat&quot;. ;)</p>

        <p>Tell the consequences and ask. For almost every action they do - &quot;we go to the store&quot; cool, there&#39;s an angry mob there yelling that might not let you through - still wanna go in? &quot;We head north toward the cabin&quot; cool, there&#39;s a fresh rock slide between you and it, and it&#39;s gonna be sketchy terrain getting there - still interested?<br /><br />I find it the best move for keeping choices meaningful.</p>

        <p>I think <b>tell them the requirements or consequences and ask</b> is probably the most important GM move, as it allows you get everyone on the same page and paint a rich, plausible world.  <br /><br />But the most fun move is probably <b>reveal an unwelcome truth</b>.  <br /><br />&quot;Oh, you cast <i>light</i> but rolled a miss? Well, the light spell works... and reveals a bunch of awakened baboons in the trees ready to pounce on you!&quot;  <br /><br />&quot;What should you be on the lookout for?  Well, you rolled a 6- to Discern Realities, so I think that pressure plate you just stepped on is something you should&#39;ve been on the lookout for, for sure.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;So you&#39;re Spouting Lore to see what you know about quicksilver, but you rolled a miss?  Well, why do you tell me about the quicksilver wretches that the slavers from the South sometimes had with them, and why they unnerved you so much?&quot;</p>

        <p>I do love &quot;tell them the requirements or consequences and ask&quot;. It covers so much that other games demand a roll for, and it gives the GM something so much more interesting to say in a difficult or impossible situation than &quot;no&quot;.<br /><br />In a recent session, our Ranger followed a trail of clues to the Black Gates. On her way there, a throng of shades collected around her. When she reached the Gate, it was locked and there was no gatekeeper—the dead could not pass on.<br /><br />In that moment the player looked at me and said &quot;what about this Super Holy Relic I have (the only thing we know of that can hurt this evil witch that is after us)? Can I use this to break the lock? What do I roll?&quot;<br /><br />I never imagined they would use Super Holy Relic on the Black Gate, and I had to think about it. &quot;What do I roll?&quot;<br /><br />Well, she didn&#39;t have Bend Bard Lift Gates, and it didn&#39;t seem to fit Defying Danger. But it seemed like the Super Holy Relic should be able to do something here.<br /><br />Then it dawned on me. Tell them the consequences and ask.<br /><br />&quot;You don&#39;t have to roll anything. You can use it to break the lock, but you will shatter the Relic as well. What do you do?&quot;<br /><br />The player anguished over that decision for a third of the session—and she did it! It really created a meaningful and engaging decision point that we were all gripped by.</p>
