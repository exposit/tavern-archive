Looking for thoughts on my custom performance moves!<br /><br />Here&#39;s the background:<br />I am running a oneshot game on the weekend where the party (four people) want to play a travelling performance troupe (they aren&#39;t all bards, so they are a pretty rag-tag group). The adventure is going to be focused on the final round of the national competition (no idea how they got to that stage given their terrible reputation... I&#39;ll be interested to hear them explain that!). The prize is a musical instrument artefact (it&#39;s cursed, and will steal noise from the world if played... not that anyone knows that). I am expecting the party to compete dirty. They&#39;ll either try and steal the artefact, or they will bribe and sabotage their way to a final performance. <br /><br />In the situation where they do end up performing, I&#39;ve come up with some custom moves. I&#39;d be interested in your thoughts!<br /><br />Perform as a Troupe:<br />When you perform as a troupe, each member must make the &quot;aid in a performance&quot; move. The sum of performance points contribute to this move:<br />* on a 10+ you blow the audience away, you are the clear winner.<br />* on a 7-9 you did admirably, but it&#39;s close. It&#39;s going to come down to the judges.<br />* on a 6- well, that didn&#39;t go well, and everyone knows it.<br /><br />Aid in a performance:<br />When you aid in a performance, roll+CHA.<br />* on a 10+, contribute 3 points to the performance<br />* on a 7-9, choose 1:<br />- contribute 2 points to the performance, but the next person to roll for the performance carries -1 forward. Explain how this happened. (this option is only available if you are not the last to roll)<br />- contribute 1 point to the performance<br />* on a 6-, contribute -1 points to the performance<br /><br />Doing things to sabotage, or to help their performance before hand will earn them +points forward on the troupes performance.<br />Bribing or blackmailing the judges will determine the result if it comes down to the judges to decide the result.<br /><br />I&#39;ve tried to balance the performance points for four people.<br /><br />Thoughts, suggestions? At the moment it is quite specific to a competition, so I&#39;d be interested to see how would you modify it to be more general purpose.

        <p>Couldn&#39;t you just make one move instead of two? I think though it would be a big wall of text it would be more elegant in the end.</p>
