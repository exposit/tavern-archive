I read someplace that Sage Latorre mentioned that he created an alternative fighter that addressed some of his concerns with the previous build. Does anyone know more about this?

        <p>All I know about is that he isn&#39;t alone in his  concerns...<br /><br /><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DungeonWorld/comments/67o78g/armor_is_broken/" class="ot-anchor">https://www.reddit.com/r/DungeonWorld/comments/67o78g/armor_is_broken/</a></p>

        <p>I like the fighter. But yeah, if you let people have more than 5 armor, it&#39;s kinda broken. On the other hand, you can always face enemies that &quot;ignore armor.&quot; And that much armor has fictional penalties: slow, noisy, can&#39;t swim, needs repairing, etc. <b>NOTE THAT the HIGHEST armor in the bestiary is 5!</b> (E.g. Apocalypse Dragon.) I would argue that at some point you just hit a practical limit of protection. Plate and shield is 5. I assume if you are getting 6+ you are using +1 magic items, which are not encouraged in DW in general.</p>

The fighter however doesn&#39;t need those +1 magical items. His advanced moves supply him with +1 armor on two separate occasions. = 6. And he can easily just grab 7+ by optimizing his multiclass options from other classes like animal companion etc. Which is discouraged, but that doesn&#39;t mean they won&#39;t go that route. Lastly ignore armor is an option, but it ruins the game that one player causes that to be a solution. The other characters would equally fall victim to ignore armor and likely not have as much hp as the fighter who caused that path to be taken.</p>

        <p>RIGHT. I forgot about the fighter getting there with moves. :) And yes, shield is 2 cost, not +2. Just misread it. <br /></p>

        <p>Armor, like everything in the game, is essentially a resource and can be &quot;touched&quot; by the GM.<br /><br />I like the first response about the goblins. Sure the knight slaughtered the first goblin with a spear, but then his buddies get smart. Its what would happen.<br /><br />GMs can take away spells. Take away arrows. Take away gear. Sure, they can take away armor too.</p>

        <p>I&#39;ve never had a problem dealing with a heavily armored player. I toss them around and get really brutal with them because I know they can handle it. Also, I didn&#39;t see anything about using messy on a monster&#39;s attack to remove armor from them. If the weapon couldn&#39;t just remove a limb (like a dragon) then it only makes sense if their weapon is messy that they can shear pieces of armor off if narrated correctly (An orc&#39;s two-handed axe slams into your shoulder pauldron. Your armor keeps you from getting damaged, but when the burly orc rips his axe out, it takes the pauldron with it. The rest of the armor on your arm feels loose and your armor is reduced by 1 until you can get it repaired.) There is also the threat of drowning, something crawling inside your armor, a heavy blow crushing your chest piece so that it is making it difficult to breath, etc. <br /><br />EDIT: Oh, and rust monsters.</p>

        <p>So, does anyone know anything about the alternative fighter class that  Sage was talking about?</p>
