<b>Interfere vs. custom Parley in intra-party conflict</b><br /><br />Something weird came up in our Planets Collide session tonight that I wanted to comment on.<br /><br />At one point, they narrate that they make camp on the beach. The Bard has two relics he got from Death&#39;s domain, so he stays awake longer than everyone else to make sure no one messes with them.<br /><br />He puts one on, and goes to sleep after everyone else.<br /><br />When the others wake up, he&#39;s sleeping still, so I tell them they have a <i>chance</i> to try to get his stuff. They don&#39;t act decisively, and he wakes up before anyone takes anything. (I&#39;m not picking on this player. In the fiction, the Bard betrayed the party once, and they do not trust him with this power.)<br /><br />But the Bard is suspicious, and he and the Barbarian get into a verbal clash. During the argument, the Druid takes one of the relics that was left in the sand.<br /><br />The Bard&#39;s player wants to roll to spot this, and the Druid&#39;s player asserts she&#39;s being sneaky.<br /><br />We all instinctively go to the dice, and it seems like Interfere is being triggered, so we try it out with the Bard &quot;interfering&quot; with the Druid holding out. He get&#39;s a 7–9.<br /><br />That&#39;s when it breaks down. &quot;✴On a 7–9, they still get a modifier, but you also expose yourself to danger, retribution, or cost&quot;. They read it to me several times, because they all have the Basic Moves in front of them and I don&#39;t, but none of us can resolve this into a plausible fictional scenario.<br /><br />I mentally turn it around and think &quot;maybe the Druid is interfering…&quot; but then it dawns on me. The Bard isn&#39;t Defying any <i>Danger</i> by looking—and the Druid isn&#39;t Defying any <i>Danger</i> by holding out. I say we made a mistake, this isn&#39;t Interfere. The Druid just has the item, and the Bard didn&#39;t see it.<br /><br />Right after that, another situation cropped up that seemed like a trigger for a move. The Bard accused the Barbarian of taking his thing, and he demanded to have it back! He <b>pressed</b> the Barbarian by threatening to drag her to Hell, which is a possibility. This seemed like a possible trigger for the revised Parley move by  <span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink" href="https://plus.google.com/102595580176380683252" oid="102595580176380683252">Jeremy Strandberg</a></span>. (Except, in hindsight, even the revised Parley move only triggers for NPCs.)<br /><a href="https://plus.google.com/+JeremyStrandberg/posts/gUbwzudRooB" class="ot-anchor">https://plus.google.com/+JeremyStrandberg/posts/gUbwzudRooB</a><br /><br />The Bard rolled a 10+, and the Barbarian picked 1 requirement, as per the move: She wanted the other relic in exchange.<br /><br />He refused to give it up, though; and out of character, the player knew she didn&#39;t have it.<br /><br />Anyway, the contrast was stark between these two resolutions. Even though both were triggered by haphazard thinking, the Parley resolution felt more authentic and meaningful, and it didn&#39;t strip anyone of their agency.<br /><br />I recognize that this version of Parley could still cause problems if used to resolve an intra-party conflict—what if the Bard gave in to the Barbarian&#39;s request? She couldn&#39;t give him what he wanted. But my gut tells me there&#39;s something robust and flexible there to work with.<br /><br />This might be the first time Interfere came up in this campaign, and we&#39;re 17 sessions in. Interfere triggered again later in the session, and the second time it handled a lot better. But hitting the snag with it makes me think it&#39;s more of a meta-move, that relegates it to a more abstract, and thus less accessible layer of the game.<br /><br />What I mean is, the trigger for Aid &amp; Interfere seems clear at first brush: &quot;When you help or hinder someone…&quot; But in actual play, it requires more abstract considerations to trigger: &quot;When you help or hinder someone <b>who is rolling to resolve their own move, which must be identified and triggered already.</b> &quot;<br /><br />Encumbrance already acknowledges this in the move: &quot;When you <b>make a move while carrying weight</b> you <i>may be</i> encumbered.&quot; In other words, the trigger is not really a trigger.<br /><br />I don&#39;t have a solution, I&#39;m just reflecting on a bit of actual play and considering how we might do better next time.

        <p>For the first scenario I agree that interfere was not appropriate.  The Bard could not take an action to interfere with what the Druid was doing.  I think a straight Defy Danger roll for the Druid to grab the item would have made sense.  If anything, the Barbarian could have aided the Druid by distracting the Bard.</p>

        <p>For the Bard pressing the Barbarian, I would have just let them role play it out.  Unless someone has a specific move or spell on their sheet that forces another PC to do something, I wouldn&#39;t remove player agency by going to the dice.</p>

        <p>I&#39;ve got all sorts of problems with both Aid and Interfere. I don&#39;t like RAW bonds, so I don&#39;t like them being a modifier to a basic move. I don&#39;t like the fact that the net gain from the move is a mechanical modifier, one which you can easily tell whether it had any effect or not (and with Aid, it only effects the outcome 1 in 4 times). And I don&#39;t like the fact that the 7-9 result seems to imply that there <i>won&#39;t</i> be risk or cost on a 10+, regardless  of the fiction surrounding your attempt to Aid or Interfere. <br /><br />So, my alternatives are available in the sheet below. <br /><br />I think I&#39;m your Druid vs Bard scenario, I think it&#39;d probably just be the Druid defying danger, the danger being that the Bard notices. <br /><br />Now, if the Bard really wanted to roll something to spot the Druid stealing the artifact, I think that&#39;s fit with Interfering by &quot;knowing they would do this&quot; (WIS). <br /><br />On a 7-9 to Interfere, the Druid has to choose: do it but minus 2, or relent and not do it. Say the Druid relents. But the Bard is now off balance, exposed, or vulnerable.  &quot;Barbarian, the Bard like spins and stares at the Druid, who&#39;s all like whistling innocently and totally not going for the artifact in the sand, but you notice the Bard is wearing the other artifact, that damn liar, and he&#39;s not paying attention to you at all. What do you do?&quot;<br /><br /><a href="http://goo.gl/gpB94t" data-embed="CNECCNACCM8CCAAST2h0dHBzOi8vZHJpdmUuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS9maWxlL2QvMEIwbEZxM0VDRFFEUWNDMW5NR05YZUZJd2RsVS92aWV3P3VzcD1kcml2ZV93ZWI6bgjY-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" data-attachment-render-hint="2" class="ot-anchor">http://goo.gl/gpB94t</a></p>

I like it. Take -2 or relent. I wonder if a similar idea could be rolled into Parley: &quot;They can choose to do what you say, or you take +1 forward against them&quot;.<br /><br />Hmmm, now I wonder if there&#39;s a good way to write a move that triggers when an NPC presses or entices a player&#39;s character to do something they don&#39;t want to. Maybe you wouldn&#39;t even need to have a roll: If they do it, they take +1 forward with the NPC. And if they refuse, they take -2 forward with the NPC?<br /><br />Nope. That would give random schmucks too much mechanical leverage over the adventurers. &quot;Simple Simon accosts you on the road demands that you give him all the magical treasure you just found.&quot;<br /><br />Without something like the contest of Wills in Sorcerer, or what DW core calls &quot;leverage&quot;, it&#39;s not really feasible.<br /><br />I&#39;m thinking we hit one of the edges of Dungeon World play—a kind of conflict that Dungeon World wasn&#39;t meant for?<br /><br />On the other hand, it can&#39;t be unheard of to have classic dungeon adventure parties argue about who gets the loot, and for those arguments to escalate. It happened in my Tunnels &amp; Trolls games more than once!</p>

        <p>As for bonds, I liked them from the start. But in my current campaign, there have been a bunch that didn&#39;t feel very impactful to the fiction, and not very memorable when they were resolved.<br /><br />When I saw this comment on Reddit last week, it became clear why.<br /><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DungeonWorld/comments/6pwdiz/how_to_resolve_player_feeling_theyre_not_getting/dktc4ro/" data-embed="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_IOKAoiByL0R1bmdlb25Xb3JsZCKRAVRvIGJlIGZhaXIsIEkgdGhpbmsgdGhlIGJvbmRzIHdyaXR0ZW4gaW4gdGhlIERXIGJvb2sgYW5kIHRoZSBzeXN0ZW0gYXMgcHJlc2VudGVkIGluIERXIGFyZSB0ZXJyaWJsZS4gQm9uZHMgYW5kIEFsaWdubWVudCBpbiBEVyBhcmUgZWZmZWN0aXZlbHkuLi7KC5UBCNMCCNICCNACCM8CCAASJWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJlZGRpdHN0YXRpYy5jb20vaWNvbi5wbmfK1MyZAVoKJWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJlZGRpdHN0YXRpYy5jb20vaWNvbi5wbmcSJWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJlZGRpdHN0YXRpYy5jb20vaWNvbi5wbmeaAQMyNTaiAQMyNTbSEWdodHRwczovL2FtcC5yZWRkaXQuY29tL3IvRHVuZ2VvbldvcmxkL2NvbW1lbnRzLzZwd2Rpei9ob3dfdG9fcmVzb2x2ZV9wbGF5ZXJfZmVlbGluZ190aGV5cmVfbm90X2dldHRpbmcv-hFvaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cucmVkZGl0LmNvbS9yL0R1bmdlb25Xb3JsZC9jb21tZW50cy82cHdkaXovaG93X3RvX3Jlc29sdmVfcGxheWVyX2ZlZWxpbmdfdGhleXJlX25vdF9nZXR0aW5nL2RrdGM0cm8v" data-attachment-render-hint="1" class="ot-anchor">reddit.com - How to resolve player feeling they&#39;re not getting enough EXP? • r/DungeonWorld</a><br /><br />After reading that, I also found this helpful:<br /><a href="https://www.burningwheel.com/wiki/images/Ab_Beliefs.pdf" class="ot-anchor">https://www.burningwheel.com/wiki/images/Ab_Beliefs.pdf</a><br /><br />For last night&#39;s session, we checked all our bonds before starting out to make sure they had at least 2 parts: a belief about the other character, and a call to action.<br /><br />I told them the call to action might be something they &quot;must do&quot; or something they expect or demand from the other character. Or it might be a boundary that cannot be crossed: &quot;I will never&quot;, or &quot;they must not&quot;.<br /><br />Several of the bonds in play were already pretty strong, but they re-wrote a few on the spot. I think it had a big impact on this session.<br /><br />With bonds like that, rolling +bond still feels meaningful to me.<br /><br />Maybe that&#39;s why this was such a &quot;soap opera&quot; session, with so much emphasis on inner conflict and conflict between the characters.</p>

        <p>Yeah, I get how bonds are <i>supposed</i> to work. But in play, I haven&#39;t ever felt the juice to be worth the squeeze.  <br /><br />The starting bonds in the playbooks are lacking in the &quot;call to action&quot; part, which makes them tough to resolve, and when players in my games have resolved bonds, more often than not they&#39;ve just left the bonds resolved and never got around to writing new ones.  It&#39;s not quick enough or intuitive enough, and doesn&#39;t drive enough of play (even with bog-standard Aid/Interfere) for it to feel <i>necessary</i> to them.<br /><br />We&#39;ve dropped them entirely in my Stonetop game, and instead of &quot;resolving bonds&quot; during end of session, we simply have this:<br /><br />&quot;Give an example of how your opinion of or relationship with another character (PC or NPC) has changed. If everyone agrees, mark XP.&quot;<br /><br />It works great! It gives us a little 5-10 minute pause at the end of each session to highlight how relationships have changed. It&#39;s felt super natural and everyone really enjoys it. Whereas the &quot;resolving bonds&quot; stuff always felt like a chore and/or a failure (because the bonds didn&#39;t resolve).</p>

        <p>Oh, also:  super cool that you used this version of Parley!  I&#39;ve vaguely thought it work okay with PC vs. PC, but it&#39;s cool to hear that it did.<br /><br />As for the bard not being able to meat the barbarian&#39;s requirement, that&#39;s totally legit by my book!  The barbarian has made their demand. If the bard can&#39;t meet it, the bard doesn&#39;t get what they want.<br /><br />Now, depending on the circumstances, I think the GM and/or the bard&#39;s player might call shenanigans on the barbarian&#39;s demand. Like, I dunno, if the bard wanted the barbarian to leave the bard alone and go back to bed and the barbarian was like &quot;Not unless you give 10,000 coin right now!&quot; I&#39;d press the barbarian&#39;s player to answer a little more honestly.  But from what you&#39;ve described, asking for the bard to turn over the 2nd artifact was totally in character <i>and</i> strategically brilliant.</p>

That was the part that might have caused trouble.<br /><br />Bard: &quot;Give me the abacus you took from me or I&#39;ll drag you to hell.&quot;<br /><br />GM: &quot;Sounds like Parley. Roll+CHA.&quot;<br /><br />Bard: &quot;I got a 10.&quot;<br /><br />GM: &quot;Barbarian, you either have to do what he wants, or choose a requirement from the list.&quot;<br /><br />Barbarian (picking the 1st option): &quot;You give me that crown and I&#39;ll give you the abacus back.&quot;<br /><br />Bard: &quot;No way.&quot;<br /><br />Suppose the Bard says yes instead, and gives her the crown. Then the Bard has met her requirement, but the Barbarian still won&#39;t give him the abacus. Because she doesn&#39;t have it, and she doesn&#39;t know who has it.<br /><br />As written, the revised Parley move doesn&#39;t make provision for this outcome. I see that AW&#39;s Seduce or Manipulate move would give the Bard some leverage here in the form of a carrot/stick. I don&#39;t know AW well enough to translate &quot;erase one of their stat highlights&quot;. Would it be like -1 ongoing to a stat?</p>

        <p>Oh!  Yeah, that&#39;s tough.  The Parley move was pressing the PC to do something that they couldn&#39;t do. Ugh...<br /><br />I&#39;ll have to roll that around a little... my gut says that the move probably needs to have a &quot;reality check&quot; element, like H&amp;S does. You can&#39;t <b><i>press or entice</i></b> a peasant to fly, after all. Doesn&#39;t matter how convincing you are if they don&#39;t have wings.<br /><br />But then... clearly the barbarian intended to bargain in bad faith. So maybe he&#39;d first Defy Danger with CHA to maintain the charade that the had the abacus? And if he did, <i>then</i> the bard could trigger Parley, as he believed the barbarian they <i>could</i> deliver on it.<br /><br />It really only works if both the players are in on it, and keen on letting the dice make the decisions for them.  <br /><br />Hmm.</p>

        <p>The bad faith element only came into focus after the Bard rolled, and the Barbarian picked an option. But I think you hit the issue on the head:<br /><br />&gt; <i>&quot;If I ordered a general to change himself into a sea bird, and if the general did not obey me, that would not be the fault of the general. It would be my fault.&quot;</i><br /><br />I think it was my fault for saying it sounds like Parley when there was no amount of pressure or enticement that could make the Barbarian do what the Bard wanted.</p>

        <p>Now the other situation—where the Druid took the Bard&#39;s relic and the Bard wanted to spot it—in hindsight, I think it ought to have gone like this:<br /><br />Druid: &quot;I take the abacus while he is distracted.&quot;<br /><br />GM: &quot;That would be Defying Danger, the danger being the Bard notices you.&quot; (after <span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink" href="https://plus.google.com/110164541089160428464" oid="110164541089160428464">Robert Finamore</a></span>) &quot;What do you do?&quot;<br /><br />Druid: &quot;I want to act fast. I got a 10.&quot;<br /><br />Bard: &quot;Hey! I want to spot this!&quot;<br /><br />GM: &quot;You can study the situation closely, but time won&#39;t stop for you. If you do that, the Barbarian could do what she wants.&quot;<br /><br />Bard: &quot;I do it anyway.&quot;<br /><br />Druid: &quot;I&#39;m hiding it though.&quot;<br /><br />GM: &quot;Okay, Bard you&#39;re Discerning Realities. And Druid you&#39;re Interfering. Druid, roll+bond.&quot; (Supposing we use the core Aid and Interfere move.)<br /><br />Druid: &quot;I got an 8. You have to roll at –2, Bard! What is the danger, retribution, or cost?&quot;<br /><br />GM: &quot;I don&#39;t know. I hope this example is over. Maybe we can use the Stonetop version of Interfere instead.&quot;<br /><br />All the players: &quot;But our bonds are meaningful—that&#39;s what this whole session has been about. Can we roll+bond instead?&quot;<br /><br />GM: &quot;Okay, Stonetop version, only rolling+bond.&quot; ;)<br /><br /><del>--</del><br /><br />Given the circumstances, we could even say that the Bard was Discerning Realities, the Druid was Interfering, and the Barbarian was Aiding the Druid!</p>
