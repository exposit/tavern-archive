I ran a poor session last week as the GM. Maybe I was tired that night, but I ended up improvising really poorly, and pretty much stuck to Show Signs of An Approaching Threat and Deal Damage for most of the adventure. It got repetitive real fast.<br /><br />To fix that, I&#39;m taking a new approach inspired by Perilous Wilds and World of Dungeons. The GM can roll to see what happens, sometimes. I made another 2-page PDF that has <b>tables to help decide which GM Move to use</b>.<br /><br />I used 2d6, because the probability bell-curve fits with how Show Signs of An Approaching Threat, Deal Damage and Put Someone in a Spot should be used more often than, for instance, Use a Danger Move. I also shortened the names of most GM Moves to make them easier &quot;at a glance.&quot;<br /><br />On the back is a condensed list of class opportunities based on the Opportunity sheet I made several days ago. Unlike GM Moves, this one needs to use 1d12 instead for even distribution.<br /><br />Finally, I threw in Critical Success that&#39;s based on World of Dungeons, because why not.<br /><br />I tested this out in an one-on-one adventure that lasted about 3 hours. It worked out way better! So much so that I want to write a session report about it. It was an amazing adventure.<br /><br />Have fun, and hope it enhances your Dungeon World experience as it did mine. :)

        <p>This is neat, but I wonder if it could become a crutch.</p>

It might be best used as something to look at instead of getting in the habit of actually rolling. Eventually, you&#39;ll have these options in your head and won&#39;t need it, but it&#39;s there just in case. Either way, good luck and thanks for sharing this.</p>

        <p>It&#39;s a short step from tables like this to GM-less play.</p>

        <p>I usually make a check on the GM moves that I use during a session, as reminder for not choosing always the same two or three.</p>

        <p>Like a lot of dice tables, seems like something I would look at and try to get inspired from during a game, but pretty much never actually roll the dice. It would make a neat web client, especially if you could add extra variations to each of the results.</p>

A GM-less Dungeon World, where you roll dice to determine your own fate and your friend describes what happens to you. It actually sounds fun.<br /><br />Fighter: I swing my axe at the ogre! <b>rolls</b> Four... a miss!<br />Cleric: The fighter misses and gets smacked in the face. <b>Fighter rolls 8</b> I cast my healing spell as he falls over. <b>rolls</b> Eight! I&#39;ll put myself in danger. I grab his shoulders to stop his fall and touch his broken nose. <b>rolls 7</b> It begins to reconstitute itself.<br />Ranger: The ogre swings down at the Cleric! I shoot his arm! <b>rolls 2</b> Damn!<br />Cleric: The Ranger&#39;s arrow buries into the Fighter. Roll 1d8. <b>Fighter rolls 4</b> I dodge the ogre&#39;s club! <b>rolls 10</b><br />Fighter: I yell in pain as the Cleric rolls out of the way. I grit my teeth and thrust my sword at the Ogre&#39;s heart! <b>rolls</b></p>

        <p>The beautiful thing about DW is the GM has moves and rules to follow. Those rules are a must happen at predetermined times. The actions are all listed for us in the rule book and we just roll on the table to determine which move the &quot;DM&quot; takes. The fiction is the only part that has to be added, and there already exist 100&#39;s of thousands&#39;s of tables for that</p>

        <p>Definitely going to use this, hopefully the fiction inspires the moves, but I know exactly what you mean when you say you feel repetitive.  Dungeon World really requires the GM to be on and it is exhausting.<br /></p>

        <p>Its kinda a loop actually. We start with fiction at the beginning of the game. When the fiction calls for a move, then we roll. That roll then inspires more fiction (guides it?) and we continue the cycle.<br /><br />So yes you&#39;re both right. Although it is kinda a chicken and the egg. Personally i think the chicken came first. ;p</p>
