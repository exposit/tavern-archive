<b>Dungeon World Session Prep: How I do it with less confusion</b><br /><br />I did not get how to set up Fronts in Dungeon World for a long time. I can&#39;t remember when or how it clicked, but I wanted to write up what I&#39;m doing differently now:<br /><a href="https://d6.beardedbaby.net/the-flameghoul-reloaded-dungeon-world-session-prep" class="ot-anchor">https://d6.beardedbaby.net/the-flameghoul-reloaded-dungeon-world-session-prep</a>

I always enjoy seeing how other GM&#39;s do their thing!<br /><br />With regards to Monster Stats, I always like to have a list of monsters relevant to the adventure, along with their stats. Not only does it help me easily run them if they show up, but I never have a &quot;suddenly orcs appear&quot; moment when I&#39;m stuck. My list ends up looking like a random encounter table with both combat and non-combat encounters that are relevant to the setting that I can pick from when I get to make a move, but are not always tied to the front exclusively (<b>setting in motion</b>).<br /><br />With regards to &quot;The last bit of prep was a note to give the characters XP if they seize command of a vessel; and if they sink an enemy vesselâ€”in addition to the normal XP rewards.&quot; Do you dole that &quot;command&quot; and &quot;sink&quot; XP out as it happens, or do you add more questions at End of Session?<br /><br />If the former, that&#39;s an interesting idea to reward the players during play: &quot;You always Mark XP when you fail, but <i>sometimes</i> you Mark XP when you do an awesome thing.&quot;<br /><br />If the latter, do you tell the players that you&#39;ve done so (and then they&#39;re on the lookout for it) or keep it a secret?</p>

        <p>My plan was to give them the bonus XP at the End of Session. And I wanted them to know it, so I mentioned it before things got started.<br /><br />They didn&#39;t directly do those things this time, and by End of Session I didn&#39;t remember to ask. But one of the ships did sink as a consequence of their actions, so I planned to give them XP for it when we meet up next time.</p>

        <p>Like you, I do prefer to have relevant monster stats handy, but it&#39;s not a must-have for me. I can&#39;t remember pulling a &quot;suddenly orcs appear&quot;, because I&#39;ve always found the monster questionnaire pretty fast and easy to use.<br /><br />I don&#39;t know the link, but I printed out something I found here that lays out the monster generator in 3 columns: #1 for HP and Armor; #2 for attacks, attack tags, and damage; and #3 for other tags, moves, and special qualities. I use that a lot.<br /><br />And even though I don&#39;t use many stock monsters, I&#39;m happy to repurpose stock monster stats any time. ;)</p>

        <p>I have changed the EoS questions before but never added to them. I don&#39;t know why I didn&#39;t think of that!<br /><br />I use monsters from tons of sources and translate them for DW. I just don&#39;t like to do so on the fly. I&#39;ll usually only use the stock stats as guidelines.</p>

        <p>Thanks for sharing. I always had problems with fronts. Overthinking them is a common issue for me. Your blog was helpful. (I will add it to my list of DW resources on my blog <a href="http://dieheart.net/dw" class="ot-anchor">http://dieheart.net/dw</a> soon.)</p>

        <p>Yes, overthinking it was absolutely my issue! That seems simpler than how I put it in the post, but I&#39;ll chalk that up to overthinking. ;)</p>
