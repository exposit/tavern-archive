        <p>Strictly fictional contributions; e.g. No risk of being flanked, using them as distractions, etc. They become part of the fictional positioning.<br /><br />Mechanically, the question I always ask myself is: &quot;do I want this to make It more or less likely the PCs see complications arise?&quot; The answer is almost always neither, so there&#39;s no reason to alter rolls.</p>

        <p>You can also treat them like temporary hirelings, if you want some mechanical heft.</p>
