I watch a bunch of videos, listen to podcasts, and look at kick starts and the like in regards to aids and supplements for table top games (for games other than PBtA/DW). I swear every time an indy company or notable person comes up with ground breaking tech to change their Trad game into something better, I always think &#39;.....Yeah, DW already does that!&#39;<br /><br />Am I the only one who thinks this? Am I the only one who thinks DW is as close to the perfect RPG experience as it may ever get?

        <p>There is no such thing as a perfect RPG, because quality is measured by the kind of experience the game creates, and different people prefer different experiences. &#39;More indie and less trad&#39; doesn&#39;t actually mean &#39;better.&#39; It just means more indie and less trad.<br /><br />I enjoy DW. It&#39;s very good at creating the types of experiences it tries to create. But I can enjoy it without thinking that it&#39;s perfect, and I can enjoy it without believing that games which create different types of experiences are somehow objectively worse.<br /><br />Keep an open mind, is what I&#39;m saying.</p>

        <p>I enjoy Dungeon World a LOT. But I also enjoy Fate Accelerated a LOT. I enjoy them both for different reasons. There are games I&#39;ll run but not play, and games that I prefer to play but not run. I enjoy  running and playing both of these games but don&#39;t consider either of them to be perfect. <br /><br />But there is absolutely nothing preventing <i>you</i> from thinking DW is perfect! When you find the game that you think is perfect it becomes a joy to run and play, and I&#39;m glad you&#39;ve found your perfect game!</p>

        <p>DW is very satisfying! I&#39;ll leave it at that. :)</p>

        <p>Perfection is in  the eye of the beholder. What&#39;s perfect for you can be the worst for someone else and the thing is. You&#39;d both be 100 percent correct because of something called. &quot;Personal Preference&quot; .</p>

I should have said, in regards to the type of game I want to play, experience to have, and what kind of game to NOT play, I think DW hits the most of my goal posts as possible. It doesn&#39;t do everything I want and it definitely doesn&#39;t do all things. But, it provides the closest to ideal for me compared to other games.</p>

        <p>They&#39;re pretty good for establishing initial relationships between PCs, but beyond that I generally prefer Flags.</p>
