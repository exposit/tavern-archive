<b>Eesh</b>, just had another game where players didn&#39;t show up and made it difficult to have a normal game session.<br /><br />What drives you nuts about your games?

        <p>Whenever the answer to &quot;What do you do you do?&quot; is &quot;I don&#39;t know&quot; followed by a long blank look and then a 10+ minute discussion where all suggestions are shot down by said player.  <br /></p>

If something is coming at them and they don&#39;t react, that&#39;s a golden opportunity and the thing just hits them! If the bad guy&#39;s working on their plan and the characters stand by, that plan gets advanced! Don&#39;t suggest what they could do (more than a couple of times anyway), but hit them with the consequences of inaction and ask &quot;What do you do <b>now</b>?&quot;</p>

        <p>I have had pretty stellar players, so all of mine are my own fault:<br />- Creating an NPC then forgetting their name by the end of the conversation<br />- Creating way too many narrative threads for each PC and having to find a way to string them all together.<br />- Crafting a really elaborate, neat experience that is undone by a detail that I forgot but a PC actually remembered. (This can actually be pretty amazing)</p>

But seriously. Take notes and read your notes. As for the second point, it helps to stick to your fronts and dangers. It is ok if you give characters potential arcs that don&#39;t come to fruition in the near term. Just keep track of it. One day you might be able to use it.</p>
