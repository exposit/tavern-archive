Are there any hacks that would work for a ice age mystic style game?

        <p>If there&#39;s no hacks for it, &quot;Do Not Let Us Die In The Dark Night Of This Cold Winter&quot; may be a good place to start something custom. I&#39;m not very familiar with it, but it&#39;s the first thing that came to mind.</p>

        <p>Just so you know, DW worked well for me without hacks in a high-tec shadowrun-like setting. Give the game some cred, it&#39;s good without any tweaks to get you into any fantasy (with magic) world you conjure with your friends. Start telling your ice age mystic story, the rules will push it forward, and rarely get in the way.</p>

        <p>First and foremost, <span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink" href="https://plus.google.com/110740615555302158335" oid="110740615555302158335">Andrzej Zielinski</a></span> has a very good point. Especially if this is your (or your players&#39;) first time with DW, you can get a LOT of mileage from just 3 (4 if you include Volley) moves: Hack and Slash, Discern Realities, and Defy Danger.<br /><br />But, sure, custom moves, items, and NPCs are what make a setting feel special, and having them at your disposal is your &quot;prep&quot; as a DW-DM. I seem to recall seeing something on DTRPG, but can&#39;t find it. Here&#39;s what I did find:<br /><br />&quot;The Frozen South&quot; adventure starter here: <a href="http://www.finemessgames.com/DWsupplements/dungeonstarters" class="ot-anchor">http://www.finemessgames.com/DWsupplements/dungeonstarters</a><br /><br />And an &quot;official&quot; cold-themed adventure (for $5): <a href="http://dungeon.world/juntu/" class="ot-anchor">http://dungeon.world/juntu/</a></p>

        <p>There&#39;s something called Simple World that&#39;s pretty much about making hacks.</p>
