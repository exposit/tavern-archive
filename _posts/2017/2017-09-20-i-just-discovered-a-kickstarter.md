I just discovered a Kickstarter for a supplement called Pirate World! Turns out it came out and was backed in 2013, so i tried to find out where it was being sold. Nothing turned up, which is a little disturbing. <br />~Does anyone know where I can find a copy, or can someone explain what happened to this project?

        <p>Short version: it dragged in production (with little to no updates from the author) for years. He finally released a PDF in February 2017, but only to backers; it was never made available to the public.  There&#39;s been a <i>lot</i> of bad feelings about it, but I don&#39;t think there was any malfeasance... just a creator who got in over his head and then handled it unprofessionally.  <br /><br />As to the quality, it&#39;s received a mediocre response. <br /><br />My personal take:  the content is a bit gonzo for my tastes, but it&#39;s largely creative stuff, more interested in evoking a <i>feel</i> than a specific <i>setting</i>.  The &quot;crunch&quot; is uneven in its implementation; some is really solid and clever, some strikes me as needlessly complicated and mechanized. The art is overall quite striking; the layout is generally good but a little cramped.  The initial release of the PDF was pretty laden with typos and such, but I <i>think</i> Ian cleaned a lot of that up.  <br /><br />My biggest gripe is that I don&#39;t care about Fate, like, at all.  And about 1/3 of the PDF is Fate stats for playbooks, etc.  <br /><br /><span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink" href="https://plus.google.com/117303281156754892991" oid="117303281156754892991">Dohyun Yun-Suescum</a></span>, what interested you in the project?  There are some other pirate-adjacent resources out there.</p>

        <p>There is also a fan-led community of people trying to make a pirate world that doesn&#39;t suck.<br /><br />Mostly disenchanted backers.<br /><br />(I backed for a hardcover I am unlikely to ever see.... )</p>

        <p>I remember being really excited for this one. Guess I&#39;m glad I just backed for PDF.</p>

        <p>Well, this is heart-breaking to hear, I feel bad for all the backers... I hope the fan community comes up with something good to take its place.<br /><br />+Jeremy Strandberg I was running a DW session and introduced a few pirate NPC&#39;s. Out of curiosity, I wanted to see if there was anything interesting I could do to expand on them. The Pirate world one looked cool cause the creator said something about ship mechanics which  I thought would make &quot;sailing&quot; more fun than me narrating what&#39;s happening on the boat</p>
