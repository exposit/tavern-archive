I came up with this move a while ago to kick off a oneshot. It&#39;s designed to facilitate a game where the player characters are all united to defeat some threat to the world. It gives each player a hand in defining the threat, with the intention being to get all the players invested from the start.<br /><br />I imagine it being used in an opening scene or prologue where the PCs are all gathered around a campfire or in a tavern sharing their information or stories. Each player rolls the move in turn and builds on the details established by the previous players, optionally starting with a GM prompt (like &quot;an evil noble&quot;, or &quot;a wild beast&quot;).<br /><br />Here&#39;s the move:<br />When you share your experience regarding the Threat, describe your previous encounter with the Threat and roll. If it was...<br />    ...through battle or contest, +Str<br />    ...through stealth or escape, +Dex<br />    ...through affliction or defeat, +Con<br />    ...through research or prophecy, +Int<br />    ...through divination or oracle, +Wis<br />    ...through rumour or trickery, +Cha<br />On a 10+, you come with insight into how to gain an advantage. Describe one weakness or limitation of the Threat.<br />On a 7â€“9, you know of the danger the Threat poses - and knowledge is power. Describe one quality that makes the Threat dangerous.<br />On a 6-, Mark XP. You possess only vague and unsubstantiated information. As 7-9, but prepare yourself - the Threat may be even more dangerous than you imagined.

        <p>This is beautiful!  I really like the idea, and will likely steal this!<br /><br />My only nitpick is that &quot;prophecy&quot; leading to + INT would be quite similar to &quot;divination or oracle&quot; leading to + WIS.  Perhaps the approach leading to INT should be &quot;research or cunning&quot; or something similar, to avoid confusion.<br /><br />Otherwise, i really like how the move is structured to let the player narratively describe a scene with the threat, and then contribute to the threat mechanically, as well.</p>
