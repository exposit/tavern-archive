        <p>To know yourself as the Being underneath the thinker, the stillness underneath the mental noise, the love and joy underneath the pain, is freedom, salvation, enlightenment.</p>

        <p>Mama was my greatest teacher, a teacher of compassion, love and fearlessness. If love is sweet as a flower, then my mother is that sweet flower of love.</p>

        <p>I think that one of the things that you do learn is that falling in love and being in love with someone is a rarity. That you donand&#39;t fall in love as many times as you think youand&#39;re going to. And then when you do, itand&#39;s really special; itand&#39;s really important.</p>

        <p>Iand&#39;m in love with red. I think itand&#39;s such a passionate color. Every flag of every country pretty much has red it it. Itand&#39;s power, thereand&#39;s no fence sitting with red. Either you love it or you donand&#39;t. I think its blood and strength and life. I do love red. I love all colors. Great shades of blue, you find them in nature. Theyand&#39;re all magic.</p>
