<b>Handling the Terrifying Tag</b><br /><br />Has anyone come up with a good move for this? Something akin to a &quot;presence&quot; attack maybe? <br /><br />I want the tag to mean something other than a general descriptor.<br /><br />Have been tinkering with this:<br /><br /><b>Shaken</b><br /><br />When you are in the presence of a terrifying creature, Roll+WIS, On a 10+ you steel your nerve and can carry on as you wish. On a 7-9 You are shaken and will take -1 ongoing until the creature is dead or no longer present. <br /><br />Thoughts?

        <p>Plain numeric modifiers are boring. I&#39;d just handle it with a defy danger when facing the terrifying thing, but if you want a specific move, I&#39;d do something along the lines of:<br /><br />When you battle against your fear, roll+wis.<br /><br />- on a 10+ it has no power over you.<br /><br />- on a 7-9 it&#39;s your choice, act while afraid suffering a -1 or flee, curl or otherwise freak out and gain 1 experience.</p>

        <p>I generally handle it with:<br /><br />1) soft move describing the fear/terror/freezing up... &quot;what do you do?&quot;<br /><br />(this could be either active, like beasty roaring in their face, or reactive, blocking their intended action)<br /><br />2) if they flee/run/freeze or otherwise act on their fear, cool. But they usually try to overcome their fear, triggering Defy Danger (often with WIS, maybe with CON; sometimes another PC gives them an order/encouragement and Defies Danger for them with CHA)<br /><br />3) 10+ free to act, until something happens that cranks it up a notch; 7-9 it takes time to steady their nerves (shift focus to another PC and/or have the <i>terrifying</i> thing make another soft move as they rally) <b>or</b> let them act now but at minus 2 (as if they&#39;d been Interfered with). Sometimes give them the choice.<br /><br />But of course, play it by ear. Sometimes the PC launching into a blind unthinking rage makes more sense on a 7-9 (and I&#39;ll take advantage of that later). Maybe they drop something. Maybe I give them the ugly choice like &quot;you can keep it together and slip out of here undetected, but you&#39;ll be leaving Astrid alone with that... <i>thing</i>. Or you can stay, but your hands won&#39;t stop shaking, take minus 1 ongoing while in its presence. <br /><br />On a 6-, mess &#39;em up. <br /><br />(Piss off, G+ formatting.)</p>
