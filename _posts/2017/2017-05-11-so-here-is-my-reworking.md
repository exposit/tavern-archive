So here is my reworking of my WOD Elf class.  I overhauled Fey and perilous Wrath the most.  I think it works even as a Dungeon World race/class move. Biggest change is ability 3.<br /><br />Elves get wood lore as their skill.  Choose two special abilities:.   1 Free spirit (you are immune to all enchantments, aging magic, natural, disease, and magic affecting those with souls.).  2 Sleepspell(with music or song, you may put all in near range who hear into light slumber.)  3 Fay and Perilous Wrath (When roused, you take on a terrifying appearance [increased height, fiery eyes, radiate light or heat, speak in thunderous roar or serpentine hiss] Enemies will flee, flinch, or be compromised) 4  Faery song (as long as you sing this song (2 minutes max) and both of you are undisturbed, you or another creature turn into a mist form of yourself, allowing you to pass through keyholes or under doors, and hold light objects gently, [you have no strength in this form for work or violence]

        <p>I like it, but it feels like abilities 2-4 are just spells. Like you could make an ability called &quot;Spell Caster&quot; or &quot;Fey Magic&quot; and list these as potential spells to either start with or learn later.<br /><br />Not familiar with your setting, but may i brainstorm some potential abilities?<br /><br /><b>Woodcraft</b> (Your kin are familiar with the forest and all it has to offer. You easily construct wooden tools or supplies when timber is within reach.)<br /><br /><b>Softly but Swiftly</b> (Not a branch or leaf out of its place. You can quietly pass through wooded area unheard or tracked)<br /><br />[MORE MECHANICAL]<br /><b>Delicate Form</b> (You are naturally slender and lean. Gain +2 towards damage rolls where precision is needed)<br /><br /><i>Alternative</i><br /><br /><b>Delicate Form</b> (Your talent is not of brute strength, but one of precision and counter measures. When attacked in melee, you may counter and deal +1 damage.)</p>

I thought the elf wrath was more transformation like a druid and  less like spell.  Inspiration for class came from <br />1 Norse mythology<br />2 Tuatha de Danaan (moves <br />3 traditional legends about Fay folk<br />4 the more magic focused elf of osric Dnd <br /><br />I was trying for something inspired by retro sourses but breaking the mold at the same time.  I have some moves from the hand to hand fighter that would be good to move over such as<br /><br />1 In control (once a day, turn a partial success into a full success)<br /><br />2 elusive (minus a 1d6 damage whenever your effectively focusing on defense over offense.)<br /><br /><br /><br /></p>
