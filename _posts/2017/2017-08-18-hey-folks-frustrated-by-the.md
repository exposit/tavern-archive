Hey folks<br /><br />Frustrated by the lack of a clean template for building my Comepndium Classes, I went and created one from scratch.<br /><br />Any thoughts or suggested improvements? I&#39;d like this to be perfect, as I&#39;ll be releasing said CC&#39;s on DriveThruRPG, although they will be avaliable on reddit in txt form.<br /><br />It goes without saying that this template is also made for any other CC makers out there.<br /><br />Cheers
