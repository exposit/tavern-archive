<b>Cloak of &#39;I&#39;s:</b> This mystic cloak is embroidered with dozens of eye-shaped patches. The cloak&#39;s wearer may see through any or all of these eyes in addition to their own, allowing them to watch their own back in combat. The patches may also be removed and reattached freely, allowing the wearer to leave them in places they would like to keep an eye on, though much like real eyes the patches are limited in number and do not grow back if destroyed.<br /><br />The cloak has one unfortunate side effect, a linguistic curse: all vowels spoken by the wearer are replaced with &#39;I&#39;s.

        <p>Mark raises an interesting question: does the cloak consider &#39;y&#39; to be a vowel? Inquiring minds want to know!</p>

        <p>I had imagined it as applying to spoken vowel sounds, not printed letters. So the honest-if-cheeky answer is &quot;sometimes y!&quot;</p>
