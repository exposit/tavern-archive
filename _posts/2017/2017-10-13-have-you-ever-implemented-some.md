Have you ever implemented some blanket damage to all players just to account for general bumps and bruises in warfare? Kind of like Scarlett Heroes, but in reverse?

        <p>Not in dungeon world as of late.  I have in my earlier games with D&amp;D.<br /><br />It&#39;s not against the rules, and can even make sense in the story, but I wouldn&#39;t do it now. Its too borring.</p>

        <p>I have not done that, though i like the idea.  I think i would write it up as a specific move, though.  <br /><br />A Monster move could be written, especially for a particularly large creature or a Horde, that essentially gave them an Area attack.<br /><br />Alternatively, a special move could be written to reflect a PC&#39;s response to the general bumps and bruises in warfare:<br /><br />When you push your way through the thick of the battle, roll + CON.  On a 10+, choose three, on a 7-9, choose one:<br />* You arrive where you wanted to go<br />* Your adversary doesn&#39;t know where you are<br />* You avoid the errant strikes of friend and foe alike<br />* You don&#39;t lose anything of value<br /><br />Or, after the battle, something like:<br /><br />When the battle ends and your adrenaline subsides, take stock of your condition and choose one:<br />* Mark a condition, and announce what happened.<br />* Collapse from exhaustion.<br />* Discover a valuable item is missing. What is it?<br />* Suffer 1d6 damage, and describe how you stayed off the effects of the wounds this long.</p>
