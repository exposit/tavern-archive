<b>Anyone willing to playtest some revised Aid or Interfere moves for me</b>? <br /><br />Over the past few weeks, I&#39;ve been thinking hard about these moves. I&#39;ve never really liked how either Aid or Interfere work, and I&#39;m strongly leaning towards using these revisions in <a rel="nofollow" class="ot-hashtag" href="https://plus.google.com/s/%23Stonetop/posts">#Stonetop</a>.  I&#39;ve started using them in my home game, but we just don&#39;t play enough (and the moves don&#39;t come up enough) for me to get a really good feel for them.<br /><br />Note that these versions don&#39;t use Bonds (though they don&#39;t preclude you from resolving bonds at End of Session).  <br /><br />If you use these, please let me know!  I&#39;ll have questions for you!<br /><br /><b>Aid</b><br />When you <b><i>help another character who is about to roll for a move</i></b>, tell us how you do it. If everyone agrees that it would help, roll a d6 and they can use your roll in place of one of their dice.  Regardless of whether they use your die, you are exposed to any risk, cost, or consequences associated with the roll.<br /><br />When you <b>jump in to help another character who just rolled_</b>, tell us how you plan to do it and ask the GM what else is required or what the consequences will be. If you accept, increase your ally&#39;s roll by +1.  <br /><br /><b>Interfere</b><br />When you <b><i>try to foil another character&#39;s move</i></b>, say how you do it and roll...<br />...+STR if you use brute force<br />...+DEX if you move quickly or employ finesse<br />...+CON if you hold steady or suck it up<br />...+INT if you exploit a relevant detail or expertise<br />...+WIS if you had a feeling they&#39;d do this<br />...+CHA if you rely on subterfuge, charm, or wiles<br /><br /><b>On a 10+</b>, they pick 1 from the list below; <b>on a 7-9</b>, they pick 1 but if they let you foil their move then you are off balance, exposed, or otherwise left vulnerable; ask them what they do next.<br />	• Do it anyway, but take -2 to the roll.<br />	• Relent, change course, or otherwise allow their move to be foiled<br />

        <p>Oh, and... feedback on the moves is welcome, but I&#39;m <b>mostly</b> interested in hearing about how they work for you in actual play.  Cheers!</p>

        <p>Will test in a little.<br />But first, a quick observation.<br /><br />The interfere move is strangely worded. I had to read it 5 times before understanding it. Could use an overhaul i feel.<br /><br />Nothing yet on how the moves work in game</p>

        <p><br /><br />I think it was the use of &quot;they&quot;.<br /><br />It starts out with Player A making the move.  Then &quot;they&quot; try to interfere (Player B).<br /><br />And in the move, Player B rolls making a choice between stats. Then &quot;they&quot; make a choice (Player A). And if &quot;they&quot; let &quot;you&quot; foil &quot;their&quot; plans then &quot;you&quot;.<br /><br />Its just alot of pronouns and the fiction bounces between subjects, so the pronouns switch targets.<br /><br />P.S.<br />As Player A making a choice on Player B&#39;s list. Again the subjects are changed and the use of &quot;thier&quot; feels odd. Im trying to find a solution.<br /></p>

        <p>Don&#39;t have a DW game running currently, but I really like the trade-off of additional requirements/consequences when rolling afterward.  I might try hacking just that part of it into my game of The Sprawl and see what happens.</p>

        <p>How about leaving the power in the hands of the interferer&#39;s roll.<br /><br /><b>10+</b> They relent, change course or otherwise let their move be foiled. <i>[This afterall is the real outcome wanted by the interferer. They got a 10, let them have it. Player A would never have picked this option on a 10+, when it really should be picked]</i><br /><b>7-9</b> They take -2 towards their roll. If they choose to instead let their move be foiled, then you find yourself in an awkward situation.<br /><br /><i>[This keeps the subject from bouncing around. And provides a more solid outcome for the interferer on a 10+. Thoughts?]</i></p>

Mainly, I don&#39;t want to give one PC the right to fully negate another PC&#39;s agency.<br /><br />I <i>am</i> thinking that the 7-9 clause might be better with simply &quot;they pick 1, but you are left off balance, exposed, or otherwise vulnerable&quot; (i.e. not have it tied to the &quot;if they choose to let you foil their action&quot;).</p>

        <p>It feels like a lot of rules for a rather minor aspect of the game. I like how aid/interfere is currently very compact in nature.</p>

        <p>i finally got a chance, and it worked out pretty well. Mostly, we used the post-roll move more often, although the one time we used the pre-roll we all agreed that the consequence that arose from the aid helped to move the plot forward a lot</p>

        <p>I haven&#39;t had a chance yet, sorry but I&#39;ll try your move when we return to DW. We were playing Uncharted Worlds for the last three sessions instead. There the &quot;get involved&quot; move is + stat, always after the roll and upgrades / downgrades the result level (failure to partial to full or the other way round) which has much more impact than standard aid/interfere in DW.</p>

        <p>I played with the rules yesterday. Here a couple of observations: Aid and Interfere came up much more often than usual. Maybe because everybody had a copy of the rules before them (and was more aware of the option) or because anouncing to help beforehand is less dangerous than per the official rules... I don&#39;t really know. (We also had a lot of PvP and thus Interfere but that was due to stuff that happened in the story). Rolling the d6 beforehand had much less of an impact than I had expected but I think that was because the PCs are all around level 7 or 8 so they naturally roll high results anyway. After the game I asked the player what they thought about the rules and they all agreed that they were fun and encouraged them to anounce helping before the roll.</p>

        <p>Sweet, thanks <span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink" href="https://plus.google.com/100166690471780012764" oid="100166690471780012764">Horst Wurst</a></span>!<br /><br />How did the &quot;expose yourself to any cost or consequences of the roll&quot; part play out? Did it ever make a difference? Did you find it easy to adjudicate/incorporate?<br /><br />How did the Interefere move go?</p>

        <p>The cost or consequence came up once (as I said they rolled 10+ a lot) but it was easy to come up with something because they were entangled in the situation by the way they described how they helped.<br />Interfere on the other hand was tricky: I wanted the whole table to discuss what was achievable for both PCs in the conflict before we rolled any dice which took some time. However I thought that giving the interfered-with-player the option to choose (instead of just giving a -2 automatically ) helped to find a consensus.<br /></p>
