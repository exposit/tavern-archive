Just ran my first DW game today for my 13yo and his little friends. I&#39;m used to d&amp;d so there was a lot of hack and slash, and 7-9. I tried not to just respond with damage and it went well. I&#39;m not used to the GM moves, and diner stare at them, but feel I used them when appropriate.

        <p>How did the players do? Did you kick a lot of the content back toward them? Were they also used to D&amp;D or was this a first RPG experience for them?</p>

        <p>I let them do what they wanted, within reason, I need to read up on a few things on the character sheets that never got used (fighter weapon precise for example) and teach them more about narrative positioning. <br />They have played d&amp;d before, but they are 8, 10, 12 and 13 so the younger ones didn&#39;t really grok it (d&amp;d). I think DW is easier for them. I kept telling them the answer isn&#39;t on your sheet!<br />I really like the fail/fail forward stuff in DW. At one point someone was looking for something useful and Discerned Realities rolled a 2 and I used it for something unrelated (zombies breaking in).</p>

        <p>About hack&amp;slash, you did well, &#39;cause you haven&#39;t to reply to a 7-9 with damage. Actually, you should use a lot the monster&#39;s moves, that generate good fiction and snowball in other moves, usually Defy Danger.</p>

Keep us posted on your continued adventures with DW. Don&#39;t forget to take advantage of all the experienced and helpful people around here. I&#39;ve found them to be full of great ideas and smart pointers.</p>

        <p>Great that you tried to avoid dealing damage. Do you remember any moves you made instead?</p>

        <p>I usually made the scene more complicated, there is a kobold attached to your staff  the eye as you shake him off you distract your companions from the approaching mob. You push him towards the thief as he bites down. <br /><br />My favorite was a 6- for a roof jump, as you roll down the pile of zombies you realize the church (just decided meeting point) is in the center of the town (where everyone is zombies).</p>
