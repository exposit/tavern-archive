<br />Vampire Watermelon	Group, Small<br />Bite (d6-2 damage)	3 HP	<br />Hand<br />Vampire pumpkins and watermelons are a folk legend from the Balkans, in southeastern Europe.The belief in vampire fruit is similar to the belief that any inanimate object left outside during the night of a full moon will become a vampire. One of the main indications that a pumpkin or melon is about to undergo a vampiric transformation (or has just completed one) is said to be the appearance of a drop of blood on its skin. <br /><br />Instinct: Drain the living<br /><br />Bite<br />Limited mobility<br />Tasty
