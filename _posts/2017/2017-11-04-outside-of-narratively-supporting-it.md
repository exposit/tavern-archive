Outside of narratively supporting it, how would you write a custom move/spell for the dnd spell, &#39;Sphere of Darkness&#39;?

        <p>I don&#39;t know that I would... I&#39;d just use the 3rd level Cleric spell &quot;Darkness&quot;. Granted, I can&#39;t find &quot;Sphere of Darkness&quot;, but the DW &quot;Darkness&quot; spell is VERY similar to the 5e 2nd level evocation spell &quot;Darkness&quot;... even if you want to create a wand or something to &quot;shoot&quot; a sphere of darkness, the trigger can be something simple like &quot;When you <b>aim the [object] of Darkness at a location you can see</b>, expend a charge from the [object] and [the the rest of the Darkness text]&quot;. You can treat charges like ammo, and you don&#39;t need to roll because you&#39;re using a charge... just thoughts, not really what you&#39;re asking for but maybe it&#39;ll help some</p>

        <p>For a move instead of a spell:<br /><br /><b>When you draw all ambient light into yourself</b>,  roll + CON. On a hit,  you are surrounded by a sphere of darkness,  extending to Reach and centered on you,  moving as you move, and lasting until you stop willing it to remain.  On a 10+, you may choose one additional effect from the following:<br />* you may anchor the darkness to another object or location;<br />* you may extend the darkness to Close range;<br />* you may allow yourself and others of your choosing to see normally in the darkness; or<br />* you also draw in all warmth - anything other than you within the sphere will freeze if possible,  and suffers your Class damage as appropriate.</p>
