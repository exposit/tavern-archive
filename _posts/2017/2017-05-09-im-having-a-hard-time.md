Im having a hard time doing dialogue when my players get to the bbeg or even just combat with lessers. What do you that helps?

        <p>When you say &quot;dialogue&quot;, do you mean you&#39;re having trouble deciding what your NPCs say? Or do you mean you&#39;re having a hard time narrating the things your NPCs do?</p>

        <p>Hard time verbally communicating as the NPC. specifically as the role of the boss bad guy</p>

        <p>Ah, so you mean you&#39;re having a hard time &quot;acting in character&quot; for the NPC. What&#39;s happening? are you just not able to think of what the NPC would say?</p>

        <p>Exactly. I can act in character for non bad guy NPCs it&#39;s just the main BBEG that I freeze on.</p>

        <p>Have you considered a non-verbal BBEG?<br /><br />I assume this is just verbal communication - you can actually get a real good response from players sometimes just by describing the actions the BBEG is doing.<br /><br />&quot;The Lord of Misrule gestures dismissively, almost bored at the adventuring party, the steel and rust in the joints of his ancient platemail creaking as me moves for the first time in centuries. As his hand begins to lower, the statues around the room snap to attention like puppets being tugged at by invisible strings. The Lord of Misrule rests an ancient, helmeted chin on steel knuckles and his empty helmet seems to regard the situation as if watching ants scurrying about&quot;</p>

        <p>Make sure your NPCs, villains included, have desires and drives. They have to want things and have plans to achieve them. And most of all they should have a reason.<br /><br />Big Lich doesn&#39;t want to destroy the town of Framberg just because. He wants to destroy it because they once killed his daughter for devil worship, a hundred years ago. This helps immensely with this sort of stuff.</p>

With these one shots I&#39;ve been doing, the bbeg at the end still has a reason, but I have just been playing him like a videogame NPC. I should take a second before sitting down at the table and think about why he even exists as an opposition to the PCs</p>
