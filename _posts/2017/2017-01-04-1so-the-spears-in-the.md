1)So, the Spears in the Ranger playbook, in the Druid playbook and the one in the Equipment section all have different tags. <br /><br />Is there an official errata for them? Maybe they&#39;re just different kind of spears, or maybe some of them have wrong tags.<br /><br /><br />2)When a character uses their adventuring gear, can they draw something that weights more than 1?<br /><br />In any case, when all the uses finish, do the equipment drawn weight collectively 1, depending on the equipment or what else?<br /><br />What about the Bag of books?

        <p>On the latter, I personally don&#39;t care about Load enough to micromanage every adventuring gear pull out so it all adds up to one. So the easiest solution for me is to imagine Load as being as much about bulk as it is about weight.<br /><br />For example, you ever buy something that&#39;s packed super efficiently (first aid kit, portable tool kit, fancy Lego tackle box, whatever)? Soon as you take one thing out, it never packs up that neatly again, and it gets bulkier the more you unpack and repack it. That&#39;s what adventuring gear is like to me, and why you can end up with more Load than you started with.</p>

        <p>Huh, suddenly the word &quot;Load&quot; makes a lot more sense than just &quot;Weight&quot;.</p>

Shot is much more space efficient.</p>
