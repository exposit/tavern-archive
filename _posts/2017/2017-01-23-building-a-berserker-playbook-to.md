Building a berserker playbook to replace the barbarian at our table. Have yet to find a satisfactory way to implement the idea of being in a blind rage, where you have to attack anybody around you including allies. I like the idea, conceptually, and it&#39;d make for fun roleplay, but within the confines of DW I just can&#39;t think of a good way to mechanically do it.<br /><br />Here&#39;s the starting moveset so far (mostly this class will be similar to the Barbarian with appetites stricken and some new moves to tie into the rage).<br /><br /> RAGE<br />When you suffer injury, frustration, loss, disappointment, or hurt, hold 1 Rage, up to a maximum of 3, and let your anger build. When you hold 3 Rage and would be made to hold 4, go Berserk.<br /><br />You may choose not to Berserk if you wish. If you do, ignore this slight and take a Debility (the GM will tell you which) until you have had time to calm down.<br /><br />Rage will dissipate over time: for every hour spent in rest or meditation, reduce your held Rage by one.<br /><br /> BERSERK<br />When you fly into a Berserk rage, roll+CON and lose control. Spend the Rage you have accrued to:<br /> Add forceful, messy,  or stunning  to an attack<br /> Add +1d6 damage to a successful attack<br /> Terrify an enemy, causing them to flee, panic, beg, or fight—their choice<br /> Halve the damage or effect of an incoming attack<br /> Ignore the effects of any debilities for a short time<br /> Perform a nigh-impossible feat of strength<br /><br />On a 10+, your frenzy has no drawbacks. On a 7-9, choose one drawback. On a 6-, choose one, and the GM chooses another:<br />• When your rage ends, take a debility (you decide which)<br />• You cannot Berserk again until you’ve had significant time to rest or meditate<br />• You’ll break or hurt something important during your rage—the GM will tell you what<br /><br />When you take action requiring a cool head, thought, discussion, subtlety, or finesse while Berserking, lose one of your held Rage. Your frenzy cannot be willed to end early: it ends only when you run out of Rage.<br /><br />Any advice? Is it worth it to even try? Maybe if I more clearly define actions taking subtlety/finesse as to include differentiating friend from foe? The biggest trouble I&#39;m seeing is that this caveat relies very heavily on fictional positioning, and I worry it&#39;d require too much time spent haggling over who&#39;s standing closest to the berserker.<br /><br />

        <p>What you have would work but my gut feeling would make the move dangerous for allies and ennemies alike. Right now on 10+ you have super efficient fighter thats all. Frenzy should be uncontrolled, dangerous and mouth frothing madness IMHO. I dont get that feel with this.</p>

(long story short, have a player who wanted a berserker, nobody objected -- nobody cares for the barbarian at our table -- and the player offered to jot down some moves they&#39;d seen somewhere on the net)<br /><br />I like it, and that&#39;s basically what I was shooting for to begin with. I think I&#39;ll work with my players to make some tweaks (there are some barbarian holdovers we&#39;d like to keep).<br /><br /><span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink" href="https://plus.google.com/109153848828658243123" oid="109153848828658243123">Vincent Quigley</a></span> What do you think would be a better arrangement for the hit/soft hit/miss? Or just some caveat for the 10+? We talked about it in our group and we see the long game being somebody who rides the razor&#39;s edge, or even uses strong discipline and control to turn berserking to their advantage -- almost a blend of berserker and monk.<br /><br />Perhaps if we reflavored to focus on the rage as something more like a battletrance? We want savagery to be an option, but not the default (or, at least, a path to trim the savagery some).</p>

        <p>I personally go with something like this, but it might not fit your vision: <br /><br />When you unleash the rage that&#39;s been boiling inside it&#39;s always bloody add the messy tag to your attacks and roll+CON <br /><br />On a 10+, choose 3. On a 7-9,choose 1. On a miss, you loose control completely, the GM will tell you the terrible things that you do...<br /><br />-You don&#39;t injure your allies or yourself.<br />-You inflict terrible wounds add +1d6 to your damage<br />-Everyone notices you&#39;re the bigger threat here<br />-You don&#39;t break anything important/valuable/you own. <br /><br />Please note that I came with this off the top of my head. There&#39;s some work to do on the options but it gives a risk/reward move that make the beserker a scary bloody  killing machine. Of course  in the fiction you and the player have to really push on the messy tag. Guts and innars flying everywere.<br /></p>

        <p>So I was thinking you had yet to find a way to implement the blind attacking of everything around you, I&#39;d say go with the 10+ approach and make it one of the drawbacks.</p>

        <p>Taking inspiration from <span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink" href="https://plus.google.com/102595580176380683252" oid="102595580176380683252">Jeremy Strandberg</a></span>&#39;s move above, I might simplify it for some of my tables.  My players struggle with hold mechanics. :-/<br /><br />BLOOD RAGE<br />When you spill blood (yours or another&#39;s) and give in to your boundless rage you go into a Frenzy.  While in a Frenzy you: <br />- do +1d6 when you deal damage <br />- gain the tag terrifying<br />- take +1 to H&amp;S and physical Defy Dangers<br />- are limited to physical moves only <br />- on any 9- rolls of your own, the GM will make an additional move related to your Frenzy.<br />- on any 9- rolls of your party members, the GM&#39;s move may be related to your Frenzy. <br /><br />When you try to control your rage, roll+WIS: on a 10+, you come out of your Frenzy and act as you wish; on a 7-9, you come out of your Frenzy but are exhausted, take time to rest or minus 1 ongoing until you do; on a 6-, ask the GM what damn fool thing you do that shocks you out of your Frenzy.</p>
