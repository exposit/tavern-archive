It shines a light on subterranean, cave-dwelling creatures as well as those who work within the criminal underground.&quot; - Red Box Vancouver</i><br /><br />I haven&#39;t checked this monster manual out yet, but I have bought both Class Warfare and Dungeon Planet by Red Box Vancouver and can attest to their quality.<br /><br /><del>--------</del><br /><br /><b>The Inexhaustive List of Dungeon World Questions</b>: <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1b44AVNA8dPwjNuywYRFhpM7ljD6ZKkjV65mTOCBVyXo/edit" class="ot-anchor">https://docs.google.com/document/d/1b44AVNA8dPwjNuywYRFhpM7ljD6ZKkjV65mTOCBVyXo/edit</a>  <br />by Veilheim<br />This is a table full of world building questions to ask yourself as the GM or ask the players. Questions are grouped by whether they are about people, groups, beliefs, things, or events. Each grouping then has multiple questions that fall into who/what/where/when/why types.<br /><br /><del>--------</del><br /><br /><b>Discern Realities Annual</b>: <a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/discern-annual-14224657" class="ot-anchor">https://www.patreon.com/posts/discern-annual-14224657</a>  <br />by The Gauntlet: <a href="http://www.gauntlet-rpg.com/" class="ot-anchor">http://www.gauntlet-rpg.com/</a><br /><b>$2+ USD patrons only</b>  <br /><br /><i>&quot;The Codex team is VERY excited to present the Discern Realities Annual!

They got Lepravosia, Devourer of Thieves to protect it, so you know there&#39;s lots of treasure there.&quot; - Johnstone</i><br /><br /><br />
