The party makes it through the mountains to the town of Willoughby and try to relax and cheer up the town while their wagon gets serviced. But will their guard be down for some unseen danger? (Also includes perhaps the worst Cartman impression ever) Starring Mike(Big Boss Dungeoneer), Jeffrey(Luddy), Verge(Kadrian), Brandt(Stink-eye) and Craig(Tomas). dungeoneerspodcast.com | facebook.com/dungeoneerspodcast | @dungeoneerspod
