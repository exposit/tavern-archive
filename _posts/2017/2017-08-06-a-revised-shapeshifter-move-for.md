<b>A Revised Shapeshifter Move for the Druid</b><br /><br />Because I&#39;m thinking about core DW classes and their moves, and maaaybe because I&#39;m avoiding other work I should probably be doing, here&#39;s my stab at redo the Druid&#39;s Shapeshift move.<br /><br />I think Shapeshift is playable as-is, and in theory I like the idea of rolling x1 to take on a form that &quot;banks&quot; limited auto-successes for the future.  But in play... eh?  I find that play kind of grinds to a halt when the druid takes on new forms, as you&#39;re establishing the moves of that form. And I also find that it&#39;s a bit too reliable and just too <i>good</i>, as:<br />1) you get too much hold (3, 2, or even 1 on a miss)<br />2) spending the hold generally skips a roll, so there&#39;s none of the interesting results that you see on a 7-9 or even a 10+ to Hack &amp; Slash or Defy Danger<br />3) Because &quot;At any time, you can spend all your hold to revert to your natural form,&quot; there&#39;s relatively little risk involved with taking on an otherwise useful form. Why <i>not</i> turn into a polar bear while you wander around the dungeon? If it starts to cause trouble, just shed the form.<br />4) Because spending hold generally lets you skip rolls, WIS becomes the hands-down most important stat and you can generally shapeshift your way around any shortcomings to your physical stats.  <br />5) The only time the GM gets direct say over what happens with the move is on a 6-, and because WIS is so important, it&#39;s not going to come up that much.<br />6) Players can keep spamming the same forms over and over again. <br /><br />So... a revision.  I know lots of folks have floated revisions, but this is mine.  <br /><br />The key things I&#39;m doing here are:<br />* Removing the roll to <i>assume</i> a shape, and instead making there be some (hopefully) interesting choices<br />* Removing the list of &quot;monster&quot; moves that you spend hold to use, and making the move basically all about fictional positioning instead of &quot;banking&quot; successes. <br />* Giving the character an instinct for the form, as a way to add (further) complications to being shapeshifted<br />* Making them roll to <i>leave</i> the shapeshift, giving the GM a chance to screw with them on a miss, or to inflict a lingering complication (the instinct), or to take that form away as an option.<br />* Explicitly calling out that you don&#39;t get the purely supernatural powers of a form you take, unless you take a move to get them.<br /><br /><br />Anyhow, I&#39;m sure there are some rough spots, but give it a look and let me know what you think!  And if anyone feels up to trying these out, or putting these into a formal-looking playbook, let me know!

        <p>This is very timely with what&#39;s going on on the Dungeon World Discord server. Are you a part of that, by chance?</p>

        <p>Cool. Gonna read this shortly, but I&#39;ll echo the idea that I want it to be dangerous to stay in form too long. I use that sometimes when a player rolls a 6- to assume a form or while in form - I describe them feeling the &quot;call of the wild&quot; and make them roll to avoid running off in their animal form. This is an old idea in lycanthropy but I remember it best from Ged turning into a hawk in the Wizard of Earthsea - when Ogion has to coax him back into humanity. I did this to my youngest son&#39;s character once. He failed the roll and went feral. I made him reroll every day after at -1 until he came out of the shape and told him if he ever took that shape again there would be a danger (he&#39;d have to roll to revert back to human). Soooooo ... good call on that!</p>

Also, strangely, the <i>Runaways</i> comic: how the Staff of One can only perform any given spell once.  I really like that narrative limitation, and wanted some way to reflect it. &quot;Sure, turning into a griffon solved this problem, but no griffon shape for you now, not until __&quot;.</p>

I haven&#39;t jumped in because the medium itself is really jarring to me... it doesn&#39;t seem conducive to long-form, nuanced discussion, which is where I&#39;m most comfortable.</p>

        <p>Hmm we never had the druid form moves skip rolls like H&amp;S. For instance, I think I had &quot;crush them in your arms&quot; for a grizzly bear, but still said they had to DD to get close enough. Are you making moves that do damage?<br /><br />Also, why not Int on Form of Legend? Seems like you&#39;d have to have some book learning to reason out the forms powers?</p>

But I was thinking more about CON because you were channeling the magic through your form, rather than puzzling out how to use it.  It feels like more of a <i>physical</i> thing to me than a mental thing.</p>

        <p>I like this.<br /><br />We have a DW core Druid in play right now, and I might present this to the player to see if she&#39;d like to switch. She has experienced the drawback of running out of hold while flying in the air as a bird before, and being able to keep the animal form for more than a few beats might appeal to her.<br /><br />But since this isn&#39;t the playbook as it was when she chose it, I won&#39;t press her about it.</p>

        <p>For what it&#39;s worth. I&#39;ve always played it in a similar manner as <span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink" href="https://plus.google.com/103667855585775066713" oid="103667855585775066713">Aaron Griffin</a></span>.  I guess we fell into our own &#39;hack&#39; because banked auto success didn&#39;t seem intuitively appropriate.  I think we are all in agreement that auto success may not be the right call, even if intended by the creators.<br /><br />After some reflection on my past experiences with Druid players, I think I let the use of hold function in a similar manner to how the GM thinks about whether or not a move triggers.  However, there is a wider fictional range to evaluate. How much of the range is free, requires a hold, or requires a roll?  A few examples:<br /><br />1) Humming bird Druid vs Ogre mid club swing - Free humming bird would easily move out of the way. <br /><br />2) Wolf Druid vs Ogre mid club swing - Spends a hold to use their leap away quickly move.<br /><br />3) Bear Druid vs <b>Huge</b> Ogre mid club swing -  Spends a hold to use your stand strong move. This is a huge ogre, you wouldn&#39;t survive in human form, but you can in bear form. However, you&#39;re going to have to roll for it, do you do it?<br /><br />Last, when I work with the players to come up with moves I steer clear of any &quot;deal damage&quot; related moves and try and focus them instead on fictional positioning effects only.  <br /><br />I think with the combination of the two, I&#39;ve found a nice balance with the players and avoided some of the Wisdom stacking issues you noted.<br /><br />Very cool ideas here and interested to see how it develops!<br /></p>
