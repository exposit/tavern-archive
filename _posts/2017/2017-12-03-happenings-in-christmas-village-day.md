Why don’t they come down to join the festivities? <b>Tell us about the outcast that lives in the belfry.</b><br /><br /><b><i>&gt; For Monsterhearts 2:</i></b> The Winter Ball is approaching and the people who care are all buzzing about who will be declared the “Belle of the Ball”. <b>What’s something on the committee’s list of themes for the ball, and what might that look like?</b><br /><br />You can comment here with your submissions. <i>We&#39;re aiming for holiday content here.
