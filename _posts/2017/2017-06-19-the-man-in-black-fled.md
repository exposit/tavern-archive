The man in black fled across the desert, and the gunslinger followed...<br /><br />I&#39;ve been thinking how easy it would be to play a Stephen King inspired Dark Tower game in Dungeon World, now that the new film release approaches and looks promising. The casting at any rate seems excellent and making the film a sequel/reboot opens up a lot of space. The playbook I downloaded from the web long ago and with that and the Dungeon World rule book it could be enough to get you started...

        <p>why hack and slash instead of volley?</p>

        <p>This class is vary poorly done, though I really like the idea.</p>

        <p>I actually think it&#39;s really good. Just a few notes:<br /><br />The racial move only fires when you ride into the sunset. Unfortunately, that&#39;s not something the player necessarily has control over if the party is centered on a single community. Try to make it triggerable by the player.<br /><br />Consider making the damage die a d6, and bump it up to D8 when using firearms as opposed to D8 bumped down to D6 when not using firearms. Feels like a reward, that way, instead of a punishment.<br /><br />Consider swapping out the leather armour move for the shooting in the air move at level 1. One gives you an interesting social power, the other is a nice buff. I&#39;d rather be able to get +1 armour later and have the social power now.<br /><br />It&#39;s not clear whether Draw stacks from fight to fight - I&#39;m assuming it doesn&#39;t.</p>

        <p>I completely agree with Michael about the move swap and changing the class damage.<br /><br />For the first half of Gunsmith I would make it &quot;You start with one firearm <i>that you made</i> &quot; and then maybe scale back the tags on the firearms a bit. Drop the pistol and rifle to just +1 piercing (no +damage), and make the blunderbuss +1 damage &amp; messy (not forceful). Later you could put in a move about smithing bullets that make shots forceful.<br /><br />The second half of Gunsmith doesn&#39;t fit with the move IMO, and should be separated out. The part about rolling snake eyes (typo says shake eyes), should be a tag added to guns, <i>unreliable</i> or something. Put the part about the damage die changing with guns as a separate move (e.g. &quot;Sharpshooter&quot; or &quot;Crack Shot&quot;). The part about using your gun in melee could be an advanced move (e.g. &quot;Stock Slam&quot; or &quot;Pistol Whip&quot;), although I don&#39;t see why rifles should be left out, and I don&#39;t see how rolling with DEX makes sense. IMO, it is enough to say that you can use a gun in that way effectively since it isn&#39;t meant for that kind of use.<br /><br />Rubbernecking should drop the word &quot;ongoing.&quot; &quot;Take +1&quot; is sufficient.<br /><br />Quick Draw doesn&#39;t make sense to me. The trigger and what you spend your draw on don&#39;t go together. The deeds feel like advanced moves that got cobbled together. Also the move name sounds like it would go better with the text of Han Shot First. Although I think the trigger could be more like, &quot;When you draw your gun and fire before anyone has a chance to react.&quot;<br /><br />Make My Day-<del>move name doesn&#39;t fit the text, IMO. Would make more sense if the move was about taunting someone into a fight.</del><br /><br /><del>Knife To A Gun Fight--I would drop this and the advanced version. I don&#39;t think the fictional reasoning is strong, and I think having 2 armor from taking the leather move is enough (on par with a Ranger).</del><br /><br /><del>One Last Shot--I love the idea here, really thematic.</del><br /><br /><del>Upgrade/Second Upgrade--I don&#39;t think the Signature Weapon enhancements make sense for a gun. It would be better to come up with some unique ones.</del><br /><br /><del>Feeling Lucky Punk-</del> A bit clunky, and even if it is random bypassing the volley roll and then dealing max damage is seems too strong to me. It doesn&#39;t make sense either: how does finding some spare ammo jangling in the bottom of your bag make you the Terminator?<br /><br />Alignments--Considering the emphasis on Outstanding Warrants both in a starting and advanced move, I suggest you drop the Lawful option and make an Evil one instead. Also, I really dig the Chaotic one.</p>
