Hi, I wonder if there&#39;s a move that let&#39;s you add your STR to the damage? (I&#39;m working on a hack and was thinking on a move like that, but want to be sure if there isn&#39;t one already).

        <p>Never seen one. <br /><br />It&#39;s a pretty damn potent move, though. Considerably more effective than Merciless, which is the closest standard move I can think of.</p>

        <p>I haven&#39;t seen one, but even in the core playbooks there are multiple examples of adding another die to your damage (Merciless, Bloodthirsty, Arcane Art and its upgrades, Backstab, etc.). So it&#39;s not a crazy idea, but as a player I&#39;d go for the extra die options instead if I wanted to increase my damage. More dice is fun, you don&#39;t have to worry about debilities, and even a d4 gives you more potential damage than the highest possible STR score. <br /><br />Bonus stats math: until at least level 3 (i.e., the earliest point at which you could have STR +3), you have at least a 75% chance to do as good or better with Merciless&#39;s d4 (i.e., you&#39;ll roll 2+ 75% of the time on a d4, and at best you&#39;ll have a +2 to STR until level 3). Even once you hit +3 STR, a measly d4 still has a 50% chance to meet or exceed it. With bigger dice the numbers get even more lopsided, and again those dice don&#39;t care about the Weak debility.<br /><br />So, not super potent compared to its peers. If anything, it&#39;s underpowered.<br /><br />(Math porn aside, +numbers moves bore the hell out of me so I probably wouldn&#39;t blow an advance on either one, but that&#39;s a separate discussion).</p>

        <p>Spitballing:<br /><br /><b>When you setup a combination attack with an ally</b>, roll the appropriate stat. On a 10+, they gain +1 Forward to their next attack and bonus damage equal to your STR if it hits. On a 7-9, they gain +1 Forward to their next attack.</p>

        <p>The thing that makes it extra potent, imo, is the reliability. &quot;Always +2&quot; (layered on to, say, a sword with standard +1 damage) is always always going to kill a 3hp horde monster with 1 armor. At STR +3, that&#39;s gonna cut down one with a shield, too. <br /><br />It&#39;s not, like, <i>broken</i> good. It just makes the damage roll a lot more reliable. Which you might see as a feature.</p>

This would be replacing a fighter signature weapon. I&#39;m making a Warrior closer to the 5e fighter. With fighting styles. One of the styles would be Great Weapon fighting... so when using a two-handed weapon, add your STR to your damage.</p>

        <p>Hmm. Is Merciless still an advanced move? Cuz d10+d4+4 is pretty hoo-daddy potent. Like, drop a <i>solitary</i> foe with 1 armor on one average hit, good. <br /><br />I like the idea, btw. Seems like a good fit for a big honking fighter. Just a little worried about the consequences combined with other stuff.</p>
