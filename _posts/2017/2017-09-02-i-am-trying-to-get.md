I am trying to get a one shot going for this evening. I&#39;ll be GM&#39;ing and I need about 2-3 others to join me. I know this is a little last minute but I&#39;ll be starting around 2:30 PST. If you&#39;d like to join, comment on my reddit post linked here. Let me know if you&#39;re interested!

I'll be running a game pretty soon at a gaming store but it's been a hot minute since I've done it. I figured I should reacquaint myself before...
