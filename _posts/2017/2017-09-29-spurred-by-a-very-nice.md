Spurred by a very nice discussion with <span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink" href="https://plus.google.com/101824580455031797035" oid="101824580455031797035">Brian Holland</a></span>​​, I&#39;ve reinterpreted a magic item from the classic Paizo-module Crown of the Kobold King for Dungeon World. For the more details and two cool firebased undead by Briand Holland, see the original post: <a href="https://plus.google.com/101824580455031797035/posts/BLV1Gr4h7AP" class="ot-anchor">https://plus.google.com/101824580455031797035/posts/BLV1Gr4h7AP</a> <br /><br /><b>Soul chain of the Forge Spurned</b><br />A forge spurned is a undead dwarf,  cursed by their dark gods to toil forever in undeath untill they can bind enough souls in their chain to buy their freedom. There is never enough souls.<br /><br />This heavy chain of shimmering warm metal is studded with small spikes and moves of it&#39;s own accord. It has 30 large black iron links, one for each soul that is bound to it, as well as several smaller chains like roots or tendrils. Anyone may claim the soul chain as their own, and it willingly serves it&#39;s new master. It wraps around the wielders hands and torso gently, almost lovingly, and will strike out at anyone threatening it&#39;s new master.<br /><br />At first, the soul chain gives +1 armor as it protects your uncovered skin. In addition, the soul chain will attack as you command it. If you use it to hack and slash, roll you damage die twice and take the better result. If attacking on it&#39;s own it does d8 damage.<br /><br />Anyone claiming the chain starts down the path of the forge spurned. The GM can use these as hard moves.<br /><br />Path of the Forge Spurned<br />*The chain grows spikes, embedding itself in your flesh. It stings, but feels so good! Your skin feels warm to the touch. Pain no longer affects you, and as a result you reduce all damage you take by 1.<br />*Your eyes begin to smolder like coal, and your skin starts to smoke slightly. You can now see into the etheral plane. All ghosts and other ethereal beings are visible to you, and you can interact with them as if they where flesh. In the far distance, you can see a red glow.<br />*Your skin ripples and moves as large velts move across your skin. The velts feel hard to the touch. All your orifices are pouring out smoke.  The chain now gives +2 armor. You can see the red glow come closer in the ethereal plane, and hear a raging fire in the distance.<br />*Chains erupt painfully from your skin, your hair and beard erupt in fire. If you do not have a beard, one will be provided. The transpossesion is complete, as the forge spurned erupts from within you, your body is burned away and your soul is bound to the ethereal plane as a ghost.

        <p>So this (basically) turns a magic item into a danger! That&#39;s a cool idea that I&#39;d never thought of. I&#39;ve been trying to make a &quot;curse&quot; move for a long time that always falls flat. This is a fantastic way to handle a &quot;curse&quot;!! Very cool!</p>

        <p>Yeah, it&#39;s definitely cursed! But my hope is that the additional powers unlocked will be enough to entice players to use it just a little bit longer. Perhaps the chain is also whispering about the power it will grant you?</p>

        <p>Yeah absolutely. I think that&#39;s the best type of cursed item. I think cursed items should always present a hard choice: do I keep using this even though it&#39;s harming me?</p>
