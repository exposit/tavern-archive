Final patron-only release of the month is a return to an old favourite. A Stench in Nosjad first came out in 2014; for this new edition I&#39;ve added more content, clearer monsters, a map by Dyson Logos and a few other titbits too. <br /><br />Have fun!

        <p>What do I need to do to be a patreon? Is there a monitory system? What does it get you? I already picked up your print bundle on DTRPG</p>

        <p>Hey Greg! You can sign up for a Patreon account and pledge a set amount per PDF I release. I&#39;ve updated my patreon page to make it clearer what you get - first access to my Dungeon World pdfs. Other things will be available on DTRPG and elsewhere, too!</p>
