Looking for some clarification on piercing damage. I&#39;ve been using it as something that ignores armor. I&#39;m gm&#39;ing and the fighter has 2 piercing damage. She rolled 6 on her damage roll against an enemy with 2 armor. My end tally of damage was 6. 6-2 armor for 4 damage +2 that ignored armor. Players had fun and couldn&#39;t care less but it&#39;s bothering me that I don&#39;t think I&#39;m doing this correctly.

        <p>That&#39;s how I roll and the other GM I played with in the past also did it this way. I think youre doing it right.</p>

        <p>According to the rules:<br />n Piercing: It goes right through armor. When you deal damage with n piercing, you subtract n from the enemyâ€™s armor for that attack.<br /><br />You&#39;re doing it right.</p>

        <p>I think your outcome was right, but I think there&#39;s a better way to think of it. If I roll 6 damage with 2 piercing against somebody with 2 armor, I think 2 armor-2 piercing = 0. 6 damage- 0 armor = 6 damage. <br /><br />(This becomes important if they have only 1 armor, for example. 1 armor- 2 piercing means 0 armor, for the same 6 damage--not 7 damage.)</p>

That&#39;s exactly why I wondered. So piercing isn&#39;t damaging by itself, it&#39;s more like a measure of how far through the armor you get with your attack.</p>
