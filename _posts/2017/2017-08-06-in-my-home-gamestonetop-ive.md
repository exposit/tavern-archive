In my home game/Stonetop, I&#39;ve been toying with changing the Ranger&#39;s <b>Hunt and Track</b> move to this:<br /><br />HUNT AND TRACK<br />When you <b><i>spend a few moments to scan your surroundings</i></b>, you can ask the GM “What tracks or other signs of passage are present here?” and get an honest answer. <br /><br />When you <b><i>Discern Realities by studying tracks or other signs of passage</i></b>, take +1 and add &quot;Where did they go?&quot; to the list of questions you can ask.   <br /><br />==================<br />By contrast, here&#39;s the original move:<br /><br />HUNT AND TRACK<br />When you <b><i>follow a trail of clues left behind by passing creatures</i></b>, roll+WIS: <b>on a 7+</b>, you follow the creature’s trail until there’s a significant change in its direction or mode of travel; <b>on a 10+</b>, you also choose 1:<br />* Gain a useful bit of information about your quarry, the GM will tell you what<br />* Determine what caused the trail to end.<br /><br />==================<br /><br />Reasoning:<br />The original move is... okay.  I like that it&#39;s a move where 7-9 gives you a full success and a 10+ gives you something extra. The things I dislike about it, though, are:<br /><br />1) It sorta implies that you need that move in order to follow a creature&#39;s trail. But really, you could get basically the same info by closely studying a set of tracks, triggering Discerning Realities, and asking &quot;What happened here recently?&quot;  &quot;Well, there was a fight, and this guy got killed, and then the victor skulked off down this tunnel.&quot;  <br /><br />2) Nothing about the Hunt &amp; Track move makes you particularly better and noticing that there are tracks in the first place. I guess that the fact I have the move, as a player, makes me more likely to ask the GM &quot;Are there any tracks here?&quot; and the GM should then be a fan and think about it and be like &quot;yeah, totally, tracks!&quot;  <br /><br />But I&#39;ve see too many players <i>not</i> do that, or just forget that they have the move until I as the GM <b>offer an opportunity fitting a class&#39;s abilities</b> and then prod them a little.<br /><br />3) It doesn&#39;t really lend itself to that scene in <i>The Two Towers</i>, where Aragon&#39;s like &quot;A hobbit lay here...&quot; and then recreates the events in his head based on the tracks. Yeah, that&#39;s totally Discern Realities and not really &quot;following a trail,&quot; but that&#39;s the kind of thing I wan the ranger with this move to be able to do. They should be able to Sherlock the place up.<br /><br />4) In Stonetop, rangers don&#39;t <i>automatically</i> start with the Hunt &amp; Track move unless they pick the &quot;Mighty Hunter&quot; background. So it&#39;s pretty important to me that the move be &quot;worth&quot; the choice and that it not imply you can&#39;t track creatures without this move.  <br /><br /><br />Anyhow... interested in opinions!  How do you like the proposed revision vs. the original move?  How heavily does Hunt &amp; Track get used in your games?  Have you had parties without rangers that followed tracks?  How&#39;d you resolve it?

        <p>Seems more useful than the old one.</p>

        <p>Why not base it on the Savvyhead move &quot;Things Speak&quot; from Apocalypse World:<br /><br />Things speak: whenever you handle or examine something interesting, roll+weird. On<br />a hit, you can ask the MC questions. On a 10+, ask 3. On a 7–9, ask 1:<br />• Who handled this last before me?<br />• Who made this?<br />• What strong emotions have been most recently nearby this?<br />• What words have been said most recently nearby this?<br />• What has been done most recently with this, or to this?<br />• What’s wrong with this, and how might I 􀃫x it?<br />Treat a miss as though you’ve opened your brain to the world’s psychic maelstrom and missed the roll.<br /><br />Obviously, the specifics would be different, but essentially the idea is &quot;a more specific and focused Discern Realities&quot;. And it would kind of get at the Aragorn/Sherlock feel you mentioned.<br /></p>

You&#39;d probably include questions like:<br />* who or what left these tracks?<br />* how many were there?<br />* how long ago where they here?<br />* what were they up to?<br />* where did they go?<br /><br />But... I don&#39;t know that those questions are really much <i>better</i> than what you can get with Discern Realities. They provide more specific detail, sure, but the that detail isn&#39;t necessarily much better than the Discern Realities questions.<br /><br />Like, imagining the Aragorn scene with this...<br />* Who or what left these tracks?  <br />&quot;Uruk hai, definitely, and some orcs. And Rhohirrim. And, oh look!  Hobbits!&quot;<br /><br />* (looking at the Hobbit tracks) What did they get up to?<br />&quot;Well, the crawled... they cut their bonds, there was an attack, and then... they got away!&quot;<br /><br />* Where did they go?<br />&quot;Across the field... into Fangorn Forest.&quot; <br /><br />=====================<br /><br />By contrast, with this move and Discern Realities...<br />* What tracks or other signs of passage are present here? <i>(for free)</i><br />&quot;There&#39;s prints all over. Uruk-hai, orcs, Rhohirim, it&#39;s a bloody mess!!&quot;<br /><br />Discern Realities (with a +1), gets a 7-9, just asks:<br />* What here isn&#39;t what it appears to be?<br />&quot;A Hobbit lay here! Either Merry or Pippin for sure, and they crawled off that way...&quot;<br /><br />* What happened here recently?<br />&quot;Well, the crawled... they cut their bonds, there was an attack, and then... they got away!&quot;<br /><br />* Which way did they go?<br />&quot;Across the field... into Fangorn Forest!&quot;<br /><br />====================<br /><br />So... I&#39;m not really sure it&#39;s worth it. And, again, I fear that it might imply that without this move, you <i>can&#39;t</i> really read tracks.  <br /><br />Does that make sense?</p>

        <p>Yeah, that totally makes sense. And for the record, I think your move was fine, I was just offering an alternative ( and an opportunity to bring up Things Speak is always welcome, because I think it&#39;s a great move.) I do think that the two-player structure you&#39;ve got laid out might get a little awkward though.<br /><br />Also, if you want to be clear that everybody has the ability to find tracks, that might be a good thing to put right into the premise of the game, so that it&#39;s on the table from the jump</p>

Psychometry is a cool power. I toyed around with something like it for the Seeker in Stonetop, but it 1) takes up too much room and 2) gives them a little <i>too</i> much insight into stuff that&#39;s supposed to be super mysterious.   <br /><br />Have you seen the Artificer (from Jacob Randolph)?  It&#39;s got a move called <b>Let Me See That</b> that&#39;s kinda similar, except you always just get to ask 2 questions and it doesn&#39;t have the &quot;psychometry&quot; aspect. I think it&#39;s something like:<br /><br />When you first examine a work of artifice, you can ask the GM 2 of the following questions and get an honest answer:<br />* Who made this?<br />* What does it do?<br />* How can I activate it?<br />* How can I fix it or improve upon it?<br /></p>
