Tweaking and editing for Session Zero Issue 3 is 99% complete. I&#39;m just waiting for one person to finish a copy editing pass to catch the pesky typos that I <b>always</b> miss.

        <p>I WILL be going into layout tonight and should be finished this weekend. With the writing for SZ3 completely done and edited, I&#39;ve started jotting down ideas for SZ4. Here&#39;s the &quot;Next Issue&quot; blurb on the back of SZ3:<br /><br />The next issue will be loaded with NPCs as we take a look at The Island Prison, inspired by two of my favorite video games - Batman: Arkham Asylum and Batman: Arkham City. Some things to look forward to are an NPC who uses fear as a weapon, A chaotic evil clown who just wants to see the world burn, a sorcerer who specializes in Ice Magic, a Druid femme fatale who uses the plants around you as her allies, and a Cowl of Disfiguring meant to disguise your appearance. Hidden away in a small cave on the island you may also find a Gnome Inventor tinkering away on some interesting gadgets...</p>
