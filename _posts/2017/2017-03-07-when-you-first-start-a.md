When you first start a game of Stonetop, you&#39;ll make characters and do introductions, establishing details about the village and the NPCs who live there. But then you&#39;ll make the Seasons Change move to let spring break forth.<br /><br />The result of that move should end up with a valuable insight or interesting news (on a 10+), threats abounding (on a 6-), or a boon plus a threat (on a 7-9).  I&#39;m intending to include &quot;adventure starters&quot; for each result.  <br /><br />This is the 10+ result for &quot;valuable insight into a threat that&#39;s been plague the steading.&quot;

        <p>This (as always for Stonetop stuff) is excellent! <span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink" href="https://plus.google.com/102595580176380683252" oid="102595580176380683252">Jeremy Strandberg</a></span> I love the amount of details provided. The set-up stuff in particular really sung for me.  Those questions and starting custom moves really show your mastery of the spirit of DW.  Ask the players and play to find out are upfront here.   This is a simple and classic set-up but its takes a life of its own because of all the color provided.</p>

        <p>Upon review this  is really great. A nice job of allowing you to paint the world with some room for PC contributions. I wish I could have bought your final product yesterday.</p>
