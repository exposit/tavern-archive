So I&#39;m looking at creating a move to let a player raise an army, but without getting really bogged down in details. An interesting idea I saw a while back was to use the Steading rules from the rulebook to kind of frame how the battle goes. Basically, the move gets the player an army that they can describe as they wish, with a Defense tag attached to it that mimics the Steading ones, from Guard (3), Garrison (4), and if they&#39;re lucky and invest a good amount into the army, Battalion (5).<br /><br />Then I&#39;d just use the Steading updates to guide how the fiction unfolds. Player commands his forces to seize a mine? Then the steading that had it originally loses it and probably gains +enmity against the PC . PC attacks a town? The steading either fights back or waits them out, losing defenses or population respectively.<br /><br />Thoughts?

        <p>If its just the PC giving orders, have it happen off-screen. For two armies clashing, you may have to wait until Inglorious comes out.</p>

        <p>I used fronts/grim portents to raise an army in my wifes game. By completing tasks and missions, her army grew. And smaller when she failed or took too long</p>

I&#39;ve always figured that the Follower moves in there would translate pretty easily into raising and managing the units of any army. Maybe tweak or add some tags, change the scale represented by their HP and damage die. Stat up enemy units in much the same way that you make monsters.</p>
