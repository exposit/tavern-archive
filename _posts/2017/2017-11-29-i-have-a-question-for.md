I have a question for my fellow DW fans :)<br /><b>Is there enough dungeon in Dungeon World?</b><br />I explain this a bit more in this post over on the StoryGames forum<br /><a href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/21383/the-dungeon-in-dungeon-world" class="ot-anchor">http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/21383/the-dungeon-in-dungeon-world</a>

Lately a few people made me notice how they feel that DW does not, in fact, serve well the experience of playing in the eponymous dungeon.

        <p>The core ideal of DW is you go to the dungeon, you get the loot, you spend the loot in town, you go to a new dungeon. repeat till campaign over.</p>

        <p>That is completely incorrect, in my humble opinion. I wonder if you are here just to spark an argument, or if that is what you actually believe. If it is what you think, I find it hard to believe that you have played a game of Dungeon World at all.</p>

        <p>IMHO, I kinda feel ya <span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink" href="https://plus.google.com/116734471115359752076" oid="116734471115359752076">Alessandro Piroddi</a></span>. There isn&#39;t a lot in the Game As Written that drives play towards dungeons in particular. There are &quot;dungeon moves&quot; and some discussion of dungeons in the fluff, but otherwise it does not seem very &quot;dungeon-centric&quot; to me either.</p>

        <p>I think it comes from the whole &quot;replace the word apocalypse with whatever type of game you&#39;re making.&quot; In this case, it was supposed to be D&amp;D, so &quot;Dungeon&quot; was slotted in, making it &quot;Dungeon World&quot;, but I don&#39;t think the designers truly meant for it to be a &quot;dungeon crawler&quot; as opposed to a &quot;play D&amp;D with PbtA rules&quot;. Adam and Sage are too savvy with design skillz; if they wanted it to be strictly a dungeon crawler, there would be explicit rules for it.</p>

        <p>10-4 fellas.<br /><br />Do I play dungeon crawls with DW? No usually; mostly because I don&#39;t like dungeon crawls as much as I like wilderness adventure. My dungeons tend to be short and to the point.<br /><br />Do I find it problematic or not adequate? Not problematic, but not super-well supported by the mechanics; at least not explicitly. <br /><br />As far as I can recall, the game kind of relies on prior knowledge of &quot;dungeon creation&quot; to make it happen, so that could be viewed as problematic.<br /><br />Edit: Missed an important &quot;not&quot; in there.</p>

        <p>I&#39;ve done plenty of dungeon crawls using DW. It works great for it.<br /><br />In fact, I&#39;d argue that a lot of the currencies and subsystems in DW don&#39;t make sense without the assumption of &quot;leaving civilization/safety behind to explore a dangerous, limited-resource area&quot;.  <br /><br />Load... uses of adventuring gear/bandages... rations... Ammo... forgetting spells (or -1 ongoing to cast) until you make camp... the Quartermaster role in UPJ... debilities that take 2-3 days of Recovery to heal...<br /><br />... those scarcity-based systems all work alongside &quot;we&#39;re in a dungeon&quot; to drive interesting decisions. Do we press on, even though we&#39;re low on HP and bandages and our cleric lost Cure Light Wounds?  Or do we make camp?  If we&#39;re out of rations, and can&#39;t make camp... do we retreat (and let the grim portents advance, or the enemies prepare themselves)?  <br /><br />You&#39;ll notice that if you play DW in a city, or as sky pirates, or rooting out cultists from the small rural town... all of these scarcity-based mechanics start to feel cumbersome and irrelevant and you wonder why you have them.  But they&#39;re <i>there for the dungeon crawl</i>.  Or at least the exploration of a dangerous area that is removed from safety and civilization. So a hex crawl works, too.<br /><br /><br />I <b>do</b> think that for a game called Dungeon World, there&#39;s remarkably little in the book or the GM&#39;s procedures or anything about <i>making dungeons</i>.  And the guidance of &quot;start with a tense situation&quot; and ask questions... well, that leaves the game wide open for going in all sorts of directions.</p>

As does a lot of the text, and even things like the way some of the starting bonds are phrased (&quot;I worry about the ability of __ to survive in the dungeon.&quot;)<br /><br />But the game <i>also</i> works very well other types of adventure.</p>

        <p>The core of the rules was built around dungeon crawl, this is a fact admitted by the devs on numerous occasions during panels and other such Q and A. After that they focused on fleshing out the system to work outside the dungeon and to facilitate adventuring and storytelling. The system can work for a wide range of stories and adventures, because they made a good system, but that doesn&#39;t change the fact its core is firmly fitted in dungeon crawling.</p>

Same experience you describe in your post.<br /><br />Then when we started the campaign <i>Plague of Storms.</i> It started at a dungeon with map, planned inhabitants, Traps etc. That feels strange for the first 1-2 hours. I miss the freedom i had before. But i get used to it quick. You loose a little freedom but get a lott of stuff that you don&#39;t have to pull out of... somewhere. <br /><br />Both ways are fine for me. And my Dungeon world hold as much dungeons as i want. Sometimes more, sometime less.</p>

        <p>I personally play it as a game about discovery, rather than dungeons, specifically. A good series of Dungeon World adventures feels a bit like an Indiana Jones film. There are dungeons, they are important, but they usually aren’t the point.</p>
