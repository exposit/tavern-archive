After so much time pursuing the forces of Evil, our heroes step into the Door of Souls, entering the ever-shifting reaches of the maddening Far Realm, in one last, desperate push to defeat the Daemon Lich known as Ur-Gammon before it releases the terrible eldritch powers of this plane into the mortal realm.<br /><br />Yeah folks, my first Dungeon World campaign (which is also my first non 1 on 1 RPG campaign) is coming to an epic ending, as the players take their first steps in another plane of existence. How would you handle the effects of a plane of madness on the players, both narratively and gameplay-wise?

        <p>Well, given the villain they&#39;re after, I would give the players prizes for &quot;hamming it up&quot; a bit ðŸ˜¸</p>
