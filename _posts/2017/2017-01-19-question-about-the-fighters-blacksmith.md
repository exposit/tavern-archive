Question about the Fighter&#39;s Blacksmith move. Have you let players add non-weapon magic item effects to weapons?

        <p>Have I? No. Would I? Maybe, but perhaps only for damaging things, and tooling things (blades to craft using carving, hammers to drive things or smith, etc). I might even be persuaded to do other effects on a case by case basis.</p>

        <p>Yeah, I think some of the really cool magical swords of legend have a lot of non-attack (and non-tool) features, detection in particular comes to mind but there are scads.</p>

        <p>Detect makes sense inasmuch as it fulfills an attack function by indicating enemies though.</p>

        <p>The Advanced move &quot;heirloom&quot; is a non-attack effect. I&#39;ve allowed a player to expand on that ability by enchanting their signature weapon.</p>

        <p>Yeah, that&#39;s one of the other effects granted by &quot;I might even be persuaded to do other effects on a case by case basis.&quot; :D</p>

        <p>there is a long-standing tradition in folklore for a &quot;Sword of Truth&quot; concept which manifests in a variety of ways, including: granting visions, or the ability to see through illusions, or preventing itself from being wielded by the &quot;unworthy,&quot; etc.</p>
