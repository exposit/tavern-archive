First shot a GMing anything. How would you address running a game with one pc?  Would you forgo the session?  Maybe play the session to hash out the world for following sessions to be joined by more players??

        <p>Slightly off topic, but I recently played Vincent Baker&#39;s two player game Murderous Ghosts and had a lot of fun with it (creepy, but fun.)  So one good option is to play a different game for the session that is designed for two players.</p>

        <p>Speaking more directly to Dungeon World, I think you definitely can play a game with 1 PC, though I don&#39;t think it will work nearly as well, as a lot of the GM moves and bonds encourage playing PCs off each-other.  I also don&#39;t recommend doing a 1 PC world-building session, since building the world together in the first session is half the fun of Dungeon World.  You can certainly talk about general ideas, but don&#39;t rob your future players of the chance to help build the initial world.</p>

That&#39;s what I was concerned about considering the world building aspect of the game.</p>

        <p>I&#39;ve done solo DW before. It can work, perhaps easier than with other system given how open-ended DW is.</p>

        <p>I&#39;d say you can do this, but you&#39;re going to be missing out on a great deal of what makes DW great - party interplay and the players working to come up with the world and so on.<br /><br />Personally, I&#39;d sit down and do some map drawing (figuratively) with the player, come up with some cool ideas for the world but, importantly, leave blanks for other players. Like I said I think you certainly can play DW as a two person system but I dont think it&#39;s best played that way.</p>

        <p>DW works fantastically well with 2 people. I&#39;ve run it as-is and with the Perilous Wilds and both things make for a great 2 player game. Check out Discern Realities for an actual play with 1 GM and 1 PC.<br /><br />Works best in short doses, my wife and I usually play for an hour and a half or less. <br /><br />Definitely do the world building thing and just let them run with it (draw maps, leave blanks, ask questions, use the answers, etc.) That way they&#39;re playing exactly the world they envision in their head. We&#39;re doing a gothic horror type setting which has been great fun.</p>

        <p>Thanks for the input. I&#39;ll go ahead with what I consider prepping for a game and give my buddy the option to play or hold for at least another player. He actually my GM so should work out either way.</p>
