In which we meet Luddy and experience his expertise of training the port of Vindmere to fight off a pirate menace with his partner Darby and the brave volunteers he recruits. Or something like that but much funnier. Starring Mike Robertson, Jeffrey Nye, Ronnie "Verge" Whitmire, Brandt "Mumbles" Wetzel and Craig Pate. dungeoneerspodcast.com | facebook.com/dungeoneerspodcast | @dungeoneerspod
