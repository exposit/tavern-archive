So here&#39;s a new World of Dungeons class I wrote trying to make an improved Sage/Bard hybrid with some FF Orator thrown in.  Behold my first draft.<br /><br /><br />Orators get Insight as their skill.  Choose two special abilities:. 1 War skald (when you galvanise a group to battle or action, all of you get +1 forward +1 armor and +1 damage for a short time). 2 Persuasive(You can try to alter someones beliefs or goals to your advantage). 3 Foresight (Roll 2d6 plus Int to discern what the future holds.) 4 Soothing tongue (you have the power to calm the savage heart and ease tension or strife)

        <p>Persuasive and Soothing Tongue have alot of overlap. Maybe replace ST with something else. Perhaps:<br /><br /><b>Entertainer</b> (You are known far-and-wide, and easily acquire the eye of others. You can use your popularity as leverage)</p>

Strategist, inspired by Sun Tzu and Musashi, famous military philosophers.<br /><br />(When analyzing a problem or conflict on a 10+ ask 2, on 7- ask one.  <br />- Can I use the terrain or setting to my advantage?<br />-Can I control energy/morale of friend or foe?<br />-Can I avert an impending crisis or enemy plot?<br /><br />I use can because it&#39;s up to the player to find the solution, not get it handed to them.</p>
