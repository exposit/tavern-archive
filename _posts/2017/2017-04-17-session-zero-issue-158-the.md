Session Zero, Issue 1: The Smoldering Swamp will be available on DTRPG later this week. I had hoped to push it out today, but my son is doing the interior artwork for me (so don&#39;t expect top-notch graphics) and I&#39;m still waiting on four images. I will possibly move towards using stock images for future issues, but it was fun working with him on this and the next issue will be one of his favorite settings: Skyrim. So he will likely illustrate that one as well before I start pulling stock images.<br /><br />Based on my schedule, it will most likely be Friday when you see it on DTRPG as a PWYW product.
