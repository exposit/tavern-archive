Why does &quot;The Sterling Hand&quot; (magical item) can be used as a wapon with &quot;near&quot; range? Shouldn&#39;t this be &quot;close&quot; range? Am I missing something?

        <p>Maybe it&#39;s a stretchy hand, maybe it shoots some near-range mining lasers. Just change it to close if you want, or leave it Near and justify it.</p>

        <p>It&#39;s weird. On the SRD, it doesn&#39;t say it&#39;s permanently attached or anything. In the book it says it&#39;s bonded. Maybe someone thought it should be able to be slung off like but later decided against it. Either that, or range definitions changed mid writing</p>

        <p>Reading it again, yeah. It should probably be <i>close</i> rather than <i>near</i>. But it is a magic item after all, so who knows what it really does. :)</p>
