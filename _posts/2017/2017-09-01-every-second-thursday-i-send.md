Every second Thursday I send out the Dungeon World Newsletter<br /><a href="http://www.dungeonworldnewsletter.com" class="ot-anchor">http://www.dungeonworldnewsletter.com</a><br /><br />On Fridays I post it to here and /r/DungeonWorld. Here is issue #11!<br /><br /><del>--------</del><br /><b>Campaign Starter: Sailing the Sapphire Isles</b>: <a href="https://plus.google.com/+JeremyStrandberg/posts/Tseo6invVGk" class="ot-anchor">https://plus.google.com/+JeremyStrandberg/posts/Tseo6invVGk</a>  <br />by Jeremy Strandberg: <a href="https://plus.google.com/+JeremyStrandberg" class="ot-anchor">https://plus.google.com/+JeremyStrandberg</a><br />This is a campaign starter by Jeremy Strandberg with a nautical theme. It uses a cool generator system where you roll one d6 for each Discern Realities questions and consult a list for each one to create the fiction. There&#39;s also rules for creating your ship and some GM tools.<br /><del>--------</del><br /><b>Monthly Monster: The Virhemoth</b>: <a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/august-2017-14034819" class="ot-anchor">https://www.patreon.com/posts/august-2017-14034819</a>  <br />by Johnstone Metzger: <a href="https://www.patreon.com/johnstone" class="ot-anchor">https://www.patreon.com/johnstone</a><br /><i>&quot;The Virhemoth is an evil deity, so maybe it&#39;s counter-productive to pledge your soul to her, but I suppose some people are just desperate enough...&quot; - Johnstone</i><br /><del>--------</del><br /><b>Rethinking how XP works</b>: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DungeonWorld/comments/6w3fqm/rethinking_how_xp_works/" class="ot-anchor">https://www.reddit.com/r/DungeonWorld/comments/6w3fqm/rethinking_how_xp_works/</a>  <br />by minneyar: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/minneyar" class="ot-anchor">https://www.reddit.com/user/minneyar</a><br />In this post reddit user minneyar discusses some shortcomings of the experience system in Dungeon World and gives some potential changes you can make in your games. It&#39;s a well thought out post and it makes good use of bold text (I have a soft spot for good bold text).<br /><del>--------</del><br /><b>Corpseglade</b>: <a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/corpseglade-14124075" class="ot-anchor">https://www.patreon.com/posts/corpseglade-14124075</a>  <br />by Joe Banner: <a href="https://www.patreon.com/jbinc" class="ot-anchor">https://www.patreon.com/jbinc</a><br /><i>&quot;A human city in ruins. The armies of the unseelie at war with the dead. And a spurned, monstrous lord that seeks to corrupt it all...</i><br /><br /><i>Corpseglade is a standalone Dungeon World adventure (you don&#39;t need any foreknowledge of my other adventures to run it.) It has 12 pages of fiction, custom moves, useful tables and pretty pictures to inform and inspire your next game of Dungeon World. Enjoy!&quot; - Joe</i><br /><del>--------</del><br /><b>Discern Realities Podcast Episode 50</b>: <a href="http://discernrealities.libsyn.com/episode-50" class="ot-anchor">http://discernrealities.libsyn.com/episode-50</a>  <br />by Jason Cordova &amp;amp; David LaFreniere: <a href="http://www.gauntlet-rpg.com/" class="ot-anchor">http://www.gauntlet-rpg.com/</a><br />Reflecting on 50 episodes of Discern Realities / New podcast: Fear of a Black Dragon / Alignments and Drives /<br />The Elixir of Reality, Discerned / The Discern Realities Annual / Our comic strip AP featuring the story of St. Evelyn the White<br /><del>--------</del><br /><br /><b>Mana Based Wizard Replacement</b>: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DungeonWorld/comments/6wg33y/critique_my_wizard_replacement/" class="ot-anchor">https://www.reddit.com/r/DungeonWorld/comments/6wg33y/critique_my_wizard_replacement/</a>  <br />by yochaigal: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/yochaigal" class="ot-anchor">https://www.reddit.com/user/yochaigal</a><br />This version of the Wizard uses a mana system similar to Volley&#39;s ammo system. If you roll a 7-9 one of your options is to lose the spell&#39;s mana cost. There are other moves that build off mana system. Yochaigal, the author, goes over a lot of his thought process in the reddit thread.<br /><del>--------</del><br /><b>Two Simple Psychs Podcast with Guest Joe Banner</b>: <a href="https://thepsychologyofgaming.com/2017/08/22/cognitive-dissonance-with-joe-banner/" class="ot-anchor">https://thepsychologyofgaming.com/2017/08/22/cognitive-dissonance-with-joe-banner/</a>  <br />by thepsychologyofgaming: <a href="https://thepsychologyofgaming.com/author/thepsychologyofgaming/" class="ot-anchor">https://thepsychologyofgaming.com/author/thepsychologyofgaming/</a><br /><i>In this episode, I am joined by Joe Banner.
