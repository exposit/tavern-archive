<b>When the players make all the GM moves against themselves?</b><br /><br />After another pulse-and-pulp-pounding session of Planets Collide, I can finally share some of the stuff that has been a long time boiling in my campaign.<br /><br />But first, here&#39;s a new thing: This session, almost all my GM moves were provoked by misses and golden opportunities. Usually, I&#39;m making GM moves left and right, snowballing the moves, which pushes the players to take decisive action.<br /><br />This time, the setup gave them a few charged situations and it was the <b>players</b> who escalated and ratcheted up their own tension.<br /><br />The party was so overwhelmed by the weight of the choices before them, and so conflicted about what to do, that they spent much of the session laboring and disputing <i>in character</i> about their power and responsibility.<br /><br />It did trigger their moves, which gave me a string of misses to deliver hard moves with. (They don&#39;t always bring their own dice, and they blame my dice for the heavy hits they endure, and consequent XP gains.)<br /><br />And sometimes their deliberations triggered golden opportunity moves, as the fiction changed around them. There were also times when they looked to find out what happens, but the intra-character conflict was coming so thick that I didn&#39;t make nearly so many moves with that prompt. I mainly had to interrupt a few times to show how the world didn&#39;t stop because of them.<br /><br />The upshot is: The tension still reached a crescendo and prompted decisive action from every player. Each adventurer not only had a character-defining moment, but those moments changed the campaign irreversibly.<br /><br />Previously, there was a witch who took the Bard&#39;s heart.<br /><br />✴The Bard just watched while the witch used his heart to kill Death right in front of him.<br /><br />✴The Ranger shattered a relic that could destroy that same witch, in order to break the lock on the Black Gate. The dead were crowded outside, unable to enter—including the Barbarian&#39;s ward, who was killed last session.<br /><br />✴The Bard donned Death&#39;s golden crown, taking the role of Death in Last Breath from now on.<br /><br />✴The Barbarian, who vowed to put the Bard&#39;s head on a stick for his past betrayals, demanded the crown, and then repeatedly <i>backed down</i> when he refused.<br /><br />✴At the moment of highest tension, the Druid used Death&#39;s abacus to restore the Barbarian&#39;s child to life. But the Barbarian&#39;s closest NPC ally fell dead in her place.<br /><br />✴And <b>then,</b> the Druid gave Death&#39;s abacus back to the Bard, while telling him to his face that he is not worthy to hold it!<br /><br />✴The Bard left in disgust through the Black Gate, as it opened to take the Barbarian&#39;s ally.<br /><br />✴And the Ranger <b>followed him</b> through the Gate!<br /><br />As the GM, I&#39;m usually a lot more involved in bringing the danger. I can hardly believe how much tension and drama there was while I exercised such restraint in making GM moves.<br /><br />Here are the custom moves I brought to this session. Each was based on the situation in the fiction before we began:<br /><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tcb-52tH9pzK0-LDlzQwjeeApqewp6SWSB-kHVOkHcs/edit?usp=sharing" class="ot-anchor">https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tcb-52tH9pzK0-LDlzQwjeeApqewp6SWSB-kHVOkHcs/edit?usp=sharing</a><br /><br />But now the situation is so different. ;)<br />

        <p>&quot;When you <b>shatter the lock on the Black Gates with the holiest relic of the Crucianite faith…</b> &quot;<br /><br />…sounds like the lead-in to a bad-ass compendium class!</p>
