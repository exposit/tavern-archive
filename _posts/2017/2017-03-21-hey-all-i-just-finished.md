        <p>If you&#39;ve been in the community for a while, you may actually recognize these from back when I ran SandyPugGames.Com! These are remastered versions, with new, better sheet templates, improved moves, fixed spelling and so on, so even if you already have them somewhere, check these out!</p>

        <p>oh man! I remember the Mimic! We had a blast with this guy. Haven&#39;t been able to find him for 2 years. Thanks for the updated versions!</p>

You&#39;ve legitimately made my day here. I really rarely hear from people who&#39;ve played these books outside of the playtesting I did. Glad you enjoyed them!</p>

        <p>This Vampire Killer class is great! I&#39;m actually considering trying to make one for the other three characters in Castlevania 3 and run my players through Drac&#39;s castle as a sort of dungeon crawl.</p>

Grant D&#39;nasty would probably fit ok into the rogue&#39;s playbook, and I&#39;m sure theres an Alucard style class out there somewhere<br />I&#39;m gearing up to run some kind of horrible video game mode game sometime soon with this and my other 3 books, maybe for Gencon</p>

The &quot;Fight Like A Pirate&quot; and &quot;Sea Legs&quot; moves both fit well with the video game version of Grant, but I&#39;d probably  need to make some adjustments in the advanced moves to better fit the campaign. <br /><br />Alucard is another matter all together. The video game character never drinks blood or does anything too vampire-y, so I wouldn&#39;t need moves for that. I&#39;d probably give him the Druid Shape Shift move for mist, wolf, and bat, and put a limitation on the things those transformations can do. I might give him that fireball spell from CV3, and put his damage at d6 or d8 for a sword or something. Afraid of going overboard with him and making the rest of the playbooks seem inferior. <br /><br />You&#39;ve done the work for the Vampire Hunter, and then I can just take a look at the wizard spells to make sure they line up with Sypha and we&#39;re off to the races.</p>
