<b>Campfire Stories</b><br /><br />When the party has made camp and they are in the quiet moments between finishing their meals and crawling into their bedrolls, one player may choose to tell a story about their past. For every party member the player has a Bond with, add +1.  This move can only be used once per Make Camp.<br /><br /><b>On a 12+</b>, you gain two hold. Your party is inspired by your candor, and they gain one hold. <br /><b>On a 10+</b>, you&#39;re centered and are reminded of who you truly are, and you gain two hold. <br /><b>On a 7-9</b>, your party gains one hold, and discuss how your teammates misinterpret the point of your story, or how you&#39;ve accidentally revealed a secret or scandal...!<br /><br />- You have a moment of self-revelation - explain the relevance of the story to your situation. Gain one experience point.<br />- The story reminds the party of what they&#39;re fighting for. Every party member that pledges something to you gains a dice bump on their next move.<br />- You&#39;ve bared your soul to those you trust. Every party member that asks a clarifying question gains a dice bump (7-9 = 10+, miss = 7-9) the next time they Defend you.<br />- You&#39;ve revealed your true nature and it surprises your comrades. Each party member that tells you how their idea of you has changed may resolve or write a new Bond with you.<br />- One party member waxes nostalgic over something in your story: a shared friend, a common goal, or that they were there with you that day. The two of you take +1 continuing when acting <i>together</i> for the rest of the session.

        <p>The Defend option seems like the weakest of the bunch. Maybe &quot;the next ally to Defend you, does so as if they rolled a 10+&quot;</p>

        <p>Yeah, tweak it a little, but this is gold.</p>

        <p>I like this a lot. What about &quot;baring your soul to them&quot; giving the other characters XP rather than the Defend buff? Or instead of directly giving them XP it offers them a chance to resolve a bond (and get XP at End of Session) or change a bond with you (because no-one has found a way to resolve a particular bond).<br /><br />But if you didn&#39;t want to do that, I like the way Aaron revised the Defend Buff!</p>

        <p>Like the &quot;resolve bond&quot; idea by Brian.<br /><br />As for &quot;Automatic 10+&quot;. Never been a fan. I do like the &quot;bump up to the next success&quot; in otherwords 6- are treated like 7-9, and 7-9 as 10+.</p>

        <p>I&#39;ve edited the move to reflect some of the suggested changes!  Really love everyone&#39;s feedback.  Thanks so much!</p>

        <p>I don&#39;t understand how they roll +Bonds with the whole party: how do you know what the modifier is? Would make more sense to use +CHA.</p>
