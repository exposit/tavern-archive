Just random thought. What if instead of the usual 10+ result on hack and slash it &quot;activates&quot; one of your weapon tag? That would imply they don&#39;t appear &quot;under the camera&quot; all the time, on in these awesome 10+ moments.

        <p>But your tags <i>should</i> be active all the time, taken into consideration whenever they&#39;re relevant.</p>

        <p>This is the kind of thing you could really highlight on a 10+, but it doesn&#39;t need to replace or change anything else about the move to do so.</p>

        <p>It&#39;s because we mostly forgot to use them plus it&#39;s a pain if you have to narrate each forceful or messy hit</p>

        <p>Get some notecards and tent-fold them in front of everyone. Write on the front the tags your most commonly used weapons have -- stuff you pick up will be memorable because it&#39;s an exception, so you shouldn&#39;t need to worry. The GM, and the players, can now at a glance see what fictional positioning should be taken into consideration when it comes time to knock skulls.</p>

        <p>I try to use the standard weapon tags (and monster attack tags) whenever they would naturally be relevant. But I <i>do</i> like mechanics that randomly trigger special effects. I would absolutely steal this idea to trigger magical effects or non-standard tags.<br /><br /><b>The Infernal Flamberge of Flaming Fire</b><br /><br />When you <b>roll a 12+ on any roll while wielding this Flamberge in battle</b>, it bursts into flame for the rest of the conflict. Just so you know, the fire is from the Place of Torment, so don&#39;t get any on you.</p>

        <p>Weapon tags have always felt to me kinda like a dangling idea, not well-integrated with the rest of the rules, so I think prompts to use them are pretty cool.</p>

        <p>I&#39;m with <span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink" href="https://plus.google.com/113677679278469240206" oid="113677679278469240206">John Aegard</a></span> on this one.  Almost everything in Dungeon World basically says &#39;do what makes sense in the fiction&#39;. Weapon tags on the other hand feel very mechanical and &#39;game-y&#39;. <br /><br />They seem transported from D&amp;D and there they make complete sense as it is a rather mechanical game when it comes to combat. In DW they don&#39;t really serve a clear purpose. Many people seem to simply forget about them, while others (mostly the D&amp;D folks) seem to expect them to trigger on EVERY attack, where they can easily get in the way of the fiction.<br /><br />Personally, I would say simply ignore them, but highlight attacks if it fits the description of the players&#39; attack on succesful rolls  and reward those successes accordingly. If anything, it will probably encourage them to give more rich descriptions of their attacks.<br /><br />If you do feel you need a move or mechanic to back it up, your suggestion would work pretty decently to do that I think.<br /><br /></p>

        <p>Weapon tags make sense to me, and not because I have any attachment to any form of D&amp;D that uses them. If the players forget what <i>reach</i> weapons let them do, have some NPCs with reach attacks, and they won&#39;t forget again, right? Or just remind themâ€¦</p>
