In preparation for a &quot;spooky&quot; DW game tomorrow, I&#39;m building a custom 0-level playbook based on &quot;The Commoner&quot;. I decided to expand on the &quot;Cower&quot; move as follows, and would love your thoughts.<br /><br />Original: <br /><b>Cower</b><br />When you drop any weapons you hold and beg for<br />mercy, opponents ignore you in favor of other targets.<br /><br />NEW: (edited)<br /><b>Cower</b><br />When you drop any weapons you hold and beg for mercy from an <i>intelligent</i> opponent, Roll + Str.<br />On a 10+, your opponent recognizes the threat you still pose, and attacks without mercy.<br />On a 7-9, your opponent will spare you, but with a cost...<br />On a 6-, your opponent ignores you in favor of other targets. <i>Do not</i> mark XP.<br /><br />It&#39;s a flip of the stat usage, with the intention that it&#39;s easier for a weaker character to appear non-threatening.<br />

        <p>Except in this case, you probably want +STR. Since, 10+ is a miss...</p>

        <p>By that logic it seems like you should get the xp on a 10+ for failing to be a coward. I mean at its heart this is basically Defy Danger flipped on its head, so...</p>

Should the PC try to retreat, though...</p>

        <p>Dude. This is awesome. I would probably give XP on the +10, but I really appreciate your courage to twist the system like this. Congrats.</p>

        <p>Why not roll with minus STR? Then you don&#39;t have to flip the fundamental logic on it&#39;s head.</p>

        <p>Getting the xp still seems like the way to go. You&#39;re already going against most players&#39; instinct  (to play heroic, competent characters). The double win of a hit and xp would at least make me more likely to use it. <br />The Take A Powerful Blow move in Masks is set up similarly and gives you the xp on a &quot;miss&quot; too.</p>

        <p>Update: The game went well, but nobody died. They came really close, though. The Cower move never came up.</p>
