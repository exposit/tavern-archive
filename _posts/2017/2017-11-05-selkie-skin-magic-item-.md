<b>Selkie Skin Magic item - roll or not roll?</b><br /><br />Recently my players visited the Shrine of the sea goddess ( <a href="https://plus.google.com/101199869016634749008/posts/QVJZPv58n85" class="ot-anchor">https://plus.google.com/101199869016634749008/posts/QVJZPv58n85</a> ), and  stared into the deep abyss. A lot of GM hold was gained. (Se the custom move in link)<br /><br />As a concequence the halfling thief Thalda was compelled by the abyss to steal the shrine-keeper Sigyn Volvas seal skin cloak. This is a magic item inspired by &quot;Billy Bones and his nautical nonpareils&quot;, a selkie skin. We ended the session as they were about to be attacked by sea serpents, and I might invoke one hold to get the thief to wrap the cloak around her and dive into the water - placing her in a dangerous position but also revealing the cloaks power to turn you into a seal.<br /><br />This is a potentially quite powerful magic item, and as described it just turns you into a seal: &quot;When you <b>wrap yourself in the selkie skin</b>, you turn<br />into a seal for as long as you stay in salt water.&quot; <br /><br />Is this fine, or should I make a custom move with a roll, with 7-9 being something like &quot;it only lasts a little while&quot; or &quot;you embrace your new form a little too much&quot;?<br /><br />Current gut feeling: save those for the inevitable Defy Dangers involved in misusing this item in creative ways.

        <p>I wouldn’t have a roll as part of the move, but I would add that they gain the instinct of a seal, and might have to defy danger to act against it.</p>

        <p>I like moves without rolls, they make the character seem powerful and reliable, but I&#39;m aware that going overboard with them can mess with the tempo of the game - after all, if there&#39;s no rolls, there&#39;s no 6-, and that&#39;s 1/3 of GM move territory gone. A good middle ground might be as <span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink" href="https://plus.google.com/102595580176380683252" oid="102595580176380683252">Jeremy Strandberg</a></span> said, to add a possible danger to the move, allowing you to fall back on and leverage the existing Defy Danger move.</p>

        <p>Or, for a magic item, of course, give it the &quot;dangerous&quot; tag.</p>
