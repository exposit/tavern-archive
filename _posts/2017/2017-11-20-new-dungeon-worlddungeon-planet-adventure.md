New Dungeon World/Dungeon Planet Adventure Conversion: In the Moon Bog<br /><br />&quot;Some time ago, the Screeching Comet shattered the night skies and crashed into the Moon Bog. Since then, a creeping doom has slowly warped the flora and fauna of the area. Those spending too much time in the bog are overcome by an alien sickness. Recently, mutant man-frogs have been encountered and villagers have gone missing. What horror resides in the Moon Bog?&quot;<br /><br /> One Page Dungeon: <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1zbDFaBoF3GEYJP3COibdoNL9aAyGMTOW" class="ot-anchor">https://drive.google.com/open?id=1zbDFaBoF3GEYJP3COibdoNL9aAyGMTOW</a><br /><br />My conversion notes: <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1NPUj_1Nzu1VCYFGLHhWQ6HBAdc_VElQP" class="ot-anchor">https://drive.google.com/open?id=1NPUj_1Nzu1VCYFGLHhWQ6HBAdc_VElQP</a><br /><br />Once again trapped in a hospital waiting room, when I should be writing something else I end up with writer&#39;s block that results into my converting this one page dungeon gem homage to Dave Arneson&#39;s classic The Temple of the Frog. If your idea of Thanksgiving fun isn&#39;t battling mutant frogs and giant hairy space aliens how do you spend your holidays??<br /><br />As always feedback of any type,comments, general observations, lavish undeserved praise, war stories, etc. are most welcome!
