I've been sick, so this is my fifth #Inktober drawing of a #DungeonWorld monster, or gear, or magical item. Just twenty six to go.

This is a quick take on the gelatinous cube. I have always loved this monster. It's like a slime mold that only comes into being as, a byproduct cold wet dark places that have magic energies emminating from the magical artifacts and the spells being cast within. I included one in the encounter table</a>
