I am surprised (and impressed) that on the Roll20 quarterly blog, Dungeon World  just barely got more games played than Savage Worlds.  <br /><br />Congrats!  (And Roll20 is awesome, I&#39;ve used to run FATE fantasy and hopefully I will be in a Champions game with all my old friends, who are scattered across the country, soon).  <br /><br />Link to report:  <a href="http://blog.roll20.net/post/156907010215/the-orr-group-industry-report-q4-2016" class="ot-anchor">http://blog.roll20.net/post/156907010215/the-orr-group-industry-report-q4-2016</a><br />

        <p>Wow, I just realized my weekly roll20 game has been running since September; where did all that time go?  One thing I&#39;ve liked with roll20 is that it makes it really easy to accommodate the inevitable player turnover that happens if you run a game for any significant length of time.  We&#39;ve had two player changes over the campaign and it never took more than a few days to find a new player.</p>

        <p>Yeah we are like Roll20&#39;s Dungeon World Rep. This is my 4th DW ran game on Roll20. I have been consecutively running games since 2015 with a month or so inbetween my new games. So its kinda like I&#39;ve been running it for 2 and a half years nearly with life hiccups here and there.</p>

        <p>Going a bit off topic, its kinda interesting to see that Pathfinder and 3.5E have more players per game than 5E. I believe that happens maybe because there are more new RPG players in 5E, as it is the newer version of the most famous RPG out there, while on the other hand, most 3.5/PF players are problably veterans.<br /><br />PS.: Happy to contribute with Dungeon World by running two weekly games : )</p>
