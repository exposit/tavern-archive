Hello,<br /><br />I joined this community a bit ago, but it has taken this long to get a campaign going. <br />A few posts tonight, starting with a rules clarification:<br />Animal companions. Let&#39;s say my Ranger, Robyn, has a wolf with scouting.  They are poking around a forest together and we decide Discern Realities gets activated. The Ranger has a wis of +2, and the wolf has a cunning of +2. Do we add 4 to the roll? In the moment I handled it as &quot;you can add your bonus, or the wolf&#39;s, but not both&quot;. If I allow both, the only way they fail that roll is if the dice show a 2. What is correct?

        <p>If you&#39;re working with your animal companion in something it si trained in, add its cunning to your roll. If you think the wolf&#39;s training in scouting helps here, add the +2, for a total of +4.</p>

        <p>I&#39;d be very shy about handing out a +4 to any roll. That said, be a fan of the characters and let them have an &quot;I got this&quot; moment when the fiction and the moves come together.<br /><br />I design playbooks to build in those moments, so I&#39;m not gonna say you&#39;re doing it wrong if someone manages to wring a +4 out of their moves.</p>

        <p>As <span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink" href="https://plus.google.com/113692337653837882568" oid="113692337653837882568">Peter J</a></span>​ said, whenever the Ranger works with their animal companion in something its trained in, you get both bonuses. So in this case, yes. The Ranger gets to roll with a +4 bonus.<br /><br />Also, remember that a 6- is not a failure. It&#39;s a miss. It doesn&#39;t necessarily mean the Ranger didn&#39;t succeed at what they were attempting. It just means you, the GM have to make a GM move.</p>
