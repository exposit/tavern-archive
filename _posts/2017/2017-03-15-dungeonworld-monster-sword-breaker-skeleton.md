Those that hear tales of them laughably call them Pincushions. Only fools that have never encountered one would make such a stupid analogy. Sword breakers are singular in their pursuit and are surprisingly strong and quick. Many have dozens of sharp surfaces protruding from their being and more than a few display the rotting remains of their last adversaries upon those jutting points.<br /><br /><b>Moves:</b><br />Impale its adversary<br />Charge into a group<br />Trap a weapon in its body

        <p>Swordbreaker doesn&#39;t make sense if it wants to collect them. &quot;Swordbarer&quot; Would work better.</p>

        <p>I still like sword breaker as a name and, as fleshed out in the comments, it would be easy to add the sword breaker flavor into it.</p>
