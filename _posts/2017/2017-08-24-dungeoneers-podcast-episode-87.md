Our heroes brave their way upstairs in the Crimson Croc manor, will they have what it takes to best Solbek and the rest of his menacing forces or will they shout encouragement from the lobby? Perhaps a little of column A, little of column B. Starring Mike(Big Boss Dungeoneer), Jeffrey(Luddy Von Sampsonite), Verge(Kadian), Brandt(Stink-eye) and Craig(Tomas). dungeoneerspodcast.com | facebook.com/dungeoneerspodcast | @dungeoneerspod
