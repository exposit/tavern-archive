<br />Vampiric Revenant	(Group, Magical, Terrifying)<br />Bite (d6 damage 1 piercing)	13 HP	1 armor<br />Close<br />Special Qualities: Undead<br /><br />A revenant in folklore is an animated corpse that is believed to have revived from death to haunt the living.The word revenant is derived from the Latin word reveniens, &quot;returning&quot; (see also the related French verb revenir, meaning &quot;to come back&quot;). <br /><br />Medieval European stories of revenants have some common features. Those who revive from the dead are typically wrongdoers in their lifetime, often described as wicked, vain, or unbelievers. Often the revenants are associated with the spreading of disease among the living. The appropriate response is usually exhumation, followed by some form of decapitation, and burning or removal of the heart. Several stories state that revenants drink blood.Revenants are therefore another example of the widespread historical belief in vampires. <br /><br />Many stories were documented by English historians in the Middle Ages. William of Newburgh wrote during the 1190s, &quot;It would not be easy to believe that the corpses of the dead should sally (I know not by what agency) from their graves, and should wander about to the terror or destruction of the living, and again return to the tomb, which of its own accord spontaneously opened to receive them, did not frequent examples, occurring in our own times, suffice to establish this fact, to the truth of which there is abundant testimony.&quot; <br /><br />Instinct: Drains blood<br /><br />Preys on the living<br />Can breathe a plague infected mist
