Working on <i>The Djinni</i> (<i>Dungeon World</i> monster class), and in terms of djinn types we&#39;re wondering if people would prefer us to stick to what mythological bits we can dig up, or just go with the D&amp;D elemental-type treatment.<br /><br />The current types are:<br /><br /><b>Ifrit:</b> Stronger and tougher than the rest.<br /><br /><b>Marid:</b> Starts with a ritual magic-type move (all djinni can learn to change their shape and use illusions, so this is an exclusive thing for them).<br /><br /><b>Si&#39;lat:</b> Can choose more options when they change their shape, and they suffer less penalties after reverting to their normal shape.<br /><br />If we were to go the D&amp;D route, ifrit would be fire-oriented, marid water-oriented, and we&#39;d swap out si&#39;lat for I guess djinni and rename the class to genie (since that&#39;s what D&amp;D does).<br /><br />Whatever the majority prefers, we&#39;d include the other in the back as an alternative option.

        <p>I definitely like the current. Elemental seems watered down compared to mythological weirdness.</p>

        <p>Real-world mythological Djinns are much more interesting than the fantasy elementals. In the Islamic traditions, some of them are Muslim, and some aren&#39;t, which puts them in a fascinating place relative to humans and Allah.</p>
