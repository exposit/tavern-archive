Question for y&#39;all<br />The Wizard and Cleric&#39;s &quot;Cast Spell&quot; move has no description of what happens on a hard fail - theres 10+ and 7-9 effects but nothing on 6-<br />(not that i&#39;m asking because in the space of last nights game, my son managed to roll a 5 - including +2 Int and +1 spent Hold - He was casting Light on a stone to throw down a dark tunnel)<br />I had a combination of all three choices - he &quot;lost&quot; the spell, took the strain and the spell just went haywire, like a flashbang, blinding the whole party for a few moments.<br />(unfortunately they were in a mine that had been cleared as there were vilstrak in it, kidnapping miners. and their Hired NPC guide got nabbed whilst they were blinded. fun times!)

        <p>On a 6-, the GM gets to make a hard move. So just about anything bad can happen, even above and beyond the listed 7-9 bad options. The light reveals that the tunnel is chock-full of bugbears, or it&#39;s actually the mouth of a purple worm, or maybe the enemy god notices the divine flicker in their hallowed territory.</p>

        <p>Usually if a move does not list a 6- clause, the GM gets to make a move. <span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink" href="https://plus.google.com/102973141371346364848" oid="102973141371346364848">Craig Judd</a></span> listed some good ones, but blinding everyone and having an important NOC get nabbed is a fine move. :D</p>

        <p>What <span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink" href="https://plus.google.com/102973141371346364848" oid="102973141371346364848">Craig Judd</a></span> said, but with one caveat: On a 6-, the GM makes a move.  It&#39;s not defined if it&#39;s a hard or soft move. That is at your discretion as long as you continue to meet the GM principles and agenda.<br /><br />On pretty much any 6- roll in the game you make any move you would like as long as it meets the GM principles and agenda. There is a list of GM moves in the rule book. A few player moves define the 6- result, which overrides this, but generally, following the resolution of the defined 6- result the players will &quot;look to you to find out what happens&quot; at which time you also make a GM move as well.<br /><br />Hope it helps!  Sounds like you&#39;re having a great time with the the game.</p>

        <p>Thanks all. <br />Glad I took the route I did. <br />Also, very heartening to see that my lad was happy to fail as he thought the outcome was fun, and glad for the XP for failing.</p>

        <p>Just for clarity - rolling a 6- does not necessarily mean that the original action fails, or even suffers any of the consequences of a 7-9.  The GM can totally say &quot;you cast your spell just fine, but...&quot; (GM move).</p>

        <p>Yeah, what <span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink" href="https://plus.google.com/109791996665503926061" oid="109791996665503926061">Robert Rendell</a></span>​ said. A 6- result doesn&#39;t have to be a failed attempt. One of my favorite things to do as GM is have the character succeed, but in a way that makes the situation much, much worse. :D</p>
