Has anyone seen a list of plots/goals for more interesting combats? I know I&#39;ve seen a really good list of ideas, so that fights aren&#39;t just &#39;combat ends when you kill that last guy&#39;<br /><br />Or if you can think of a one sentence pitch, we can start a list here.

        <p>Not sure if this is actually helpful, but your post triggered some neurons in my brain about a rather good script writing advice post I read some years ago:<br /><br /><a href="http://kfmonkey.blogspot.com.au/2005/12/writing-action-scenes.html" class="ot-anchor">http://kfmonkey.blogspot.com.au/2005/12/writing-action-scenes.html</a><br /><br />His conclusion for movies is: Don&#39;t write action scenes. Write suspense scenes that require action to resolve.<br /><br />... which is I guess what you&#39;re doing here.  The stakes of a combat shouldn&#39;t generally be &quot;do the PCs survive&quot;, but rather &quot;will the PCs manage to achieve this additional goal during this combat, as well as surviving?&quot;<br /><br /><br /></p>

        <p>Less about goals but It&#39;s always good to remember that enemies are usually intelligent, or have hunting instincts if they are monsters. <br /><br />Enemies will set up ambushes, cover, and use distance and ranged weapons to keep players at bay, etc. because they actively don&#39;t want to die. Just by making your enemies smart it forces the players to act smart, and combat gets way more interesting and intense.</p>

        <p>Hold the line while the innocents escape. Throw in a quick risk/reward mechanic, like making them flee over a river, where directing them to take the bridge means taking time for maneuvering to it but swimming means accepting a certain number of drowned people.<br /><br />A body-jumping possession means either killing an ally or taking sub lethal damage while trying to figure out the rules/mechanics of the possession.<br /><br />A verbal parry-reposse while in a one on one noble/sports duel with a respected law abiding antagonist, before an audience whose option/alliance is important.</p>
