Saw a random shield somewhere and got inspired to create the final magic item for my Into the Heart of the Dragon campaign (or at least the item discovered when the party escapes the dragon)<br /><br /><b>World Eater Scale Shield</b>					<i>Close, +2 Armor, 2 Weight</i><br />This massive dragonâ€™s scale had all the dermis and blood scraped off and some leather strapping woven on (nobody&#39;s found out how to rivet the thing). When you Defy Danger against elemental attacks, or Hack and Slash by a Shield Bash, Treat a 6- as 7-9, a 7-9 as 10+, and if applicable, a 10+ as 12+.<br />

        <p>How about something like:<br /><br />When you <b><i>Defend with this shield</i></b>, you can spend 1 hold to intercept and negate any elemental attack. When you <b><i>bash someone with this shield</i></b>, the damage is +<i>forceful</i>.</p>

        <p>I like that. It&#39;s far less complicated, but I also think I want to add the effects of Staunch Defender. (you always get +1 hold, even on a 6-)<br /></p>
