Hey friends! <br /><br />Has anyone ever created custom moves/rules for fantasy sports games? My players have expressed a wish to engage in some sort of sports game (e.g. Blood Bowl, Quidditch, etc) within our DW campaign, and I thought I&#39;d see if there was any existing material out there!<br /><br />I&#39;m particularly interested in ideas that work for a range of character types (i.e. not every player is physically competent)...

        <p>How about drag racing in hell? I&#39;ve got a draft of a mini-game called &quot;Car Fightin&#39; Hell Beasts&quot; I&#39;d be happy to share. I&#39;ve no idea how you might integrate it into an existing campaign tho. But it might give you some ideas.</p>

        <p>Unless you want to gloss over the details, the Basic Moves seem like a good fit. Sports like Quidditch and Ice Hockey are <i>really</i> dangerous, so let them defy some danger. If they want to find the Snitch or figure out which teammate is open or which adversary is vulnerable, let them discern some realities. If someone calls out code and they need to consult knowledge to remember plays or special tricks, let them spout some lore. And in a sport with Beaters (or hockey players), Hack &amp; Slash is a definite possibility.<br /><br />And so on. :)</p>

        <p>Make 6 love letters, each one a game, for a 5-game series. Each time they play, have then draw a love letter at random. Each love letter asks describes a highlight for each character and asks a loaded question or has a custom move with some fictional outcomes that result from the game -- injuries, medals, notice from important people, fandom, etc. Half of the letters also result in their team winning. Then publish them for the rest of us to use. :-)</p>

        <p>Thanks for the awesome ideas! I hadn&#39;t considered that the basic moves were simple enough to support this sort of play, and also I&#39;m into the idea of love letters as a way of keeping the sport aspect going as part of a larger adventure. Cheers!</p>
