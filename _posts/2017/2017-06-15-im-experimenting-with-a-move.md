I&#39;m experimenting with a move for a spellcaster that specializes in divination, but I wanted to do it differently than just the standard cast a spell. Here&#39;s the two moves I came up with, but I don&#39;t know if this is a good idea. What do you think?<br /><br />Read the Fates<br />When you spend some time consulting the fates, roll 2d6 and place them on this move. When you make another move, you may use one of these dice in place of either of the dice rolled for that move. You cannot use this move again until you have used both of the dice on this move.<br /><br />When you cast a divination spell, discard a die on Read the Fates, then cast a spell from your list with a level less than the value of the die you discarded. (wherein your spell list has spells of levels 1 through 5)

        <p>That&#39;s a really neat core system! What kind of divination spells were you thinking of including?</p>

        <p>I really like where the first one is headed.  I&#39;d recommend ending the move with some fiction though.  Good fictional trigger but then it&#39;s just a roll.  I would do something like:<br /><br />Read the Fates<br />When you spend some time consulting the fates, roll 2d6 + WIS.  On a 10+, describe the symbols the fates have awarded you and place both dice on this move.  On a 7-9, same as above, but place the greater of the dice on this move.  On a 6-, you are presented disturbing or unclear visions of the future place the lower of the dice on this move, in addition to any GM move.  You may only have a maximum of two dice on Read the Fates at anytime.<br /><br />Write the Fates<br />When you make another move, or trigger aid/interfere, you may replace a rolled die for your move, or for the move in which you aided/interfered, with a die placed on Read the Fates.  If you do this, describe how you realized the symbols and visions you previously saw gave you the foresight to act accordingly.  <br /><br />I would probably drop the 2nd move.  There is a problem in that it takes away any risk at the moment of casting as there is no chance to roll a 7-9 or 6-.  I also have a hard time with the link of casting a spell with divination abilities.  They already get an advantage to the &quot;cast a spell&quot; move through Read the Fates.</p>

        <p>Good point on &quot;starting from the fiction&quot;. I&#39;ll keep that in mind. Though I still want the dice to be some kind of useful resource that can be played with besides swapping them.<br /><br />I&#39;ll probably use the existing divination spells from DW, and maybe poach one or two from Class Warfare. It&#39;ll be a small list, just two at each level.<br /></p>

        <p>Cool.  I would just incorporate the resource into a rolled move then.  I think moves with auto success should be avoided as it takes away the tension of a potential GM move. You want to maintain that tension as it keeps the moment to moment fiction interesting and engaging for everyone at the table. <br /><br />Maybe have the number on the die be the modifier they get on the cast a spell roll (1-2 = +1; 3-4 =+2, 5-6 = +3). Or use the number of dice, or number on the die used, to increase or decrease the magnitude of the spells effect. Under one of these approaches you have a resource to spend, but maintain risk vs reward. <br /><br /></p>

        <p>I&#39;m still debating what I want magic to look like, but here&#39;s what I have now:<br /><br />When you <b>take a few hours to consult your oracle</b>, roll a d6 and place it on this move. This is your Prophecy Die. Additionally, the GM will also tell you of grim portentâ€”a bleak event that will come to pass without your intervention. You cannot use this move until that grim portent occurs, or when you intervene to prevent it from occurring.<br /><br />When you <b>get a brief glimpse of the future while making another move</b>, you may exchange one of the dice rolled for that move with your Prophecy Die.</p>

I like that it ties into the fronts system, and lets the player &quot;peek behind the screen&quot; so to speak. Should the player be allowed to specify a grim portent that pertains to a specific individual, item, place, etc?</p>

        <p>I find it a bit weird using singular dice, it doesn&#39;t happen anywhere else in the game so it&#39;s not mechanically consistent. If this is like Divination in D&amp;D then what&#39;s wrong with rolling 2D6 at the beginning of the session and then you can trade the result with ANY 2D6 roll that is made later on (by anyone)?</p>

        <p>Instead of holding/swapping one (or both) of the action d6s, seems to me one could also hold a class die instead.</p>

        <p>I like the Read The Fates move.  I would dictate that it was something that could be done during Make Camp and require some kind of divination tool (of player&#39;s choice) like tea leaves, animal carcass (augury), fortune telling cards, etc.,.  <br /><br />I would also tie it into unveiling information about a grim portent in ways that reflect Discern Reality roles, with a 6- including the effect that you&#39;d no longer be able to successfully Read The Fates on this particular Danger again until the next Grim Portent comes to pass.</p>
