So... Inglorious.  For those of you who have seen it, what did you think of it?  Did it live up to your expectations?  <br /><br />I think I was looking for an extension of the steadings and into warfare in more of a story mode than a wargamey mode and I felt a bit turned back from it.   Am I the only one?  If not, have you tackled war and domain management in your DW games at all?  What did you do?  How did it work?  <br /><br />I keep wanting to &quot;fill this gap&quot; with some ideas, but rather than rush forward (as I&#39;m often apt to do), I thought I&#39;d start by seeing if anyone else is interested in this?  If so, do you have any do&#39;s and don&#39;ts?<br />

        <p>I don&#39;t know that it&#39;s been released beyond backers yet.  If I hear differently I&#39;ll happily post it. <br /></p>

        <p>From the DW KS comments on the last update, 13 June 2016:<br /><br />&quot;Is this ever coming out?&quot; 30 December<br /><br />&quot;Eric: yep, it will. We&#39;ve incorporated all Inglorious changes and are just in the laborious process of production. We work mostly with part-time artists so we try to be respectful of their schedules and let them do things on their own time. Once we have everything we&#39;ll send it out.&quot; 3 January</p>

        <p>I covered a war with Fronts, and Threats as normal. I haven&#39;t checked out <b>Inglorious</b> in detail yet.</p>
