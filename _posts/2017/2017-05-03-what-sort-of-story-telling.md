What sort of story telling techniques do you guys implement when running Dungeon World so that you don&#39;t get bogged down in NPC interaction? <br /><br />Despite having ran various games in various systems over the years, I still feel like a fairly inexperienced GM when it comes to mastery of pacing/nuance. I know from experience in our campaign that DW really sings when you&#39;re dungeon crawling or fighting off monsters, but a lot of what we&#39;ve done in this campaign so far has revolved around cities, and cities equal people, and people equal conversation. I feel fine when it comes to roleplaying NPCs, so I don&#39;t think the quality of my NPCs is in question, but I need to find a way to minimize the need for NPCs and maximize the action while still telling an interesting story. <br /><br />I&#39;m fairly certain the answer to my question is to take the adventure away from the cities if I&#39;m feeling that our sessions has too much NPC interaction, but maybe there&#39;s a way to run DW in an urban setting where social interaction is a thing while still managing to give the players things to fight.<br /><br />Any suggestions?

        <p>Depends on your players. Do they enjoy mingling in towns? If they do there are plenty of adventures to have in town ( gangs, politics, rival brew masters). If the players are bored there are hundreds of ways to get them back to dungeon crawling.</p>

Last night&#39;s game took them to an island off the coast with an evil subterranean temple build beneath a church devoted to a goddess of healing and light, and there&#39;s nothing but monsters as far as the eye can see. <br /><br />I think I&#39;m just feeling out of touch with where we&#39;ve been lately in our campaign and my natural instinct is to populate the game with all of these interesting NPCs, but that&#39;s not what DW is about (imo).</p>

        <p>You feel they have too much interaction, and you say that your campaign songs during battle. What isn&#39;t allowing you do do both? Are all mobs dumb trolls? Preludes and consequences to battle aren&#39;t threats and death, there should be something more at stake than life during battle in a world of adventurers, they know they might die at any moment.</p>

        <p>Ok so my notes on pacing and NPC interaction and all that... this is a bit of a brain dump about pacing and scene framing in general.<br /><br />A scene is a unit of play that has characters in a place doing a thing. Scenes can start when the characters arrive in a place, and end when the leave it. This is the traditional model - go to a tavern, haggle with the barkeep, drink, leave.<br /><br />But I find scenes more exciting if we cut either of those short. Instead of starting when players enter the tavern you start &quot;sitting at a table in The Powder Cask, drinking your ale that you&#39;re pretty sure the barkeep watered down just for you&quot;. Instead of ending when they leave, end on a moment of tension like maybe &quot;as you guys laugh the night away, the stranger in the corner keeps watch on you the entire night.... the next morning, you awaken in your beds a bit worse for wear&quot; (this actually closes one scene and frames the next).<br /><br />And DW allows this inherently. <b>Put them in a spot</b> is a scene framing move. Maybe someone rolls a 4 while fleeing in some dark alley - put them in a spot and say &quot;Everything goes black. You wake all up in a dark warehouse, a strange oily powder stuck to your clothes. It smells like the sea. How long were you out for...?&quot;<br /><br />Strong scene framing will keep the pace up. It&#39;s hard to do right and certainly requires trust. If you&#39;re going to switch to this mode, I&#39;d have a talk with your players first.<br /><br />&quot;Ok guys, I&#39;m going to try this thing called &#39;hard scene framing&#39; where I basically play with where you are and who&#39;s there at a time. We will fill in blanks as we go - that&#39;s part of the fun - but if you&#39;re resistant to it, it can falter. If I say Carl and Steve are in the tavern, instead of saying oh Steve wouldn&#39;t go to the tavern or Carl wanted to go shopping, I invite you to roll with it and fill in the blanks as part of play. Steve wouldn&#39;t go to the tavern? Then why is he here right now? Is he looking after Carl? Did Carl ask him to come along? Roll with it, and it will be fun&quot;.</p>

That&#39;s one of the story telling techniques I&#39;ve been missing in my tool chest. Normally, my brain just goes step by step. That&#39;s fine and all, but the downside to getting stuck in that frame of mind is that you end up dragging your feet through minutiae, and that&#39;s no fun for anyone. I&#39;m definitely going to give this a shot!</p>

That&#39;s why it&#39;s important to talk to players about it.<br /><br />Scene framing doesn&#39;t get discussed a lot outside of some more esoteric indie games. Smallville has some great advice for when you know to end a scene. Primetime Adventures is built on scene framing.<br /><br />The skill and technique is knowing when to start a scene, what components to mix in, and how to end it. It&#39;s also important to know how to jump between two scenes so players share the spotlight. Example:<br /><br />GM: &quot;Ok so Steve you&#39;re in the alley staking out the cobbler&#39;s shop, right? You hear movement behind you. A couple of street urchins are there. Kids, really. One has a dagger and is sneering at you. What do you do?&quot;<br />P: &quot;Well I&#39;m gonna beat their asses and take that dagger from the punks. Think they can mess with me... Shit, I rolled a 5&quot;<br />GM: &quot;That&#39;s probably gonna hurt. We&#39;ll come back to that. While Steve is getting his ass beat, how&#39;s Carl doing in this arm wrestling tournament at the bar?&quot;<br /><br /></p>

        <p>I like what <span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink" href="https://plus.google.com/103667855585775066713" oid="103667855585775066713">Aaron Griffin</a></span> said. I would also add that DW is particularly good at dealing with this kind of issue. If you see something getting bogged down in one session, you can write a move to make that same situation more abstract for the next session. <br /><br />If they&#39;re spending a lot of time looking for someone, turn it into a move. If they&#39;re getting stuck in city politics make a move for it. Make sure to throw in some hard choices and player-directed scene-building so they don&#39;t feel the dice taking everything out of their control.</p>

        <p>&quot;what are you trying to get out of this conversation&quot; and I take the discussion meta.  Because sometimes players are looking for clues or the feeling of something is important in a scene... and I&#39;ve moved on in my mind.  I&#39;m quite willing to say, &quot;hey, I don&#39;t have anything super important for this scene, it can just be color... unless you want to do something specific, I&quot;m perfectly happy to move on&quot;.  I put the onerous on myself.  &quot;I&#39;m perfectly happy to move on&quot; and that lets the players off the hook.  They didn&#39;t miss something.  <br /></p>

        <p>There&#39;s a mantra in script writing(?) about how scenes should always start late and end early. If people are asking questions and wondering things, that&#39;s good!</p>

The players are looking at them to see what happens when they speak to an NPC, after all.<br /><br />So, when the Cleric drops in on the town&#39;s temple and says hello to the high priest, the priest doesn&#39;t respond &quot;Ah, greetings Piotr, good to see you!&quot; and proceed to an unstructured conversation.  You instead put them on the spot (the temple&#39;s Inquisitor approaches while you&#39;re speaking with the priest... &quot;Piotr - I noticed you weren&#39;t at the prayer vigil for our holiest day last week.&quot;) or show signs of an approaching threat (the priest appears distracted and upset - you notice he&#39;s holding a letter crumpled in his hand) or gives an opportunity that fits a class ability (&quot;Piotr, thank Grum!  There&#39;s something I need you to do!&quot;) or suchlike.<br /><br />It would probably get farcical if every person they said &quot;hello&quot; to triggered a GM move, not to mention frustrating if the players have something specific they&#39;re trying to get out of the conversation.  But you can certainly look at the moves if you find that a conversation is flagging and pick one to propel the story into action again.</p>

        <p>I ran a great city based campaign, so I don&#39;t think the setting is the problem. Remember that part of your <b>Agenda</b> is to <i>Fill the Characters&#39; Lives with Adventure</i>.<br /><br />Look over the game&#39;s <b>Principles</b> again. <i>Ask Questions</i> to find out why the characters are talking with NPCs, and <i>Think Dangerous</i>.<br /><br />Don&#39;t forget to make <b>Moves</b>  whenever everyone looks to you to see what happens next. The GM Moves ensure that&#39;ll you&#39;ll find action.<br /><br />Also Advance your <b>Fronts</b>. Use them to put pressure on the characters.<br /><br />Reread the section on <i>When to Make a Move</i>. Use Soft Moves at first, but remember that if ignored, that&#39;s a golden opportunity for a Hard Move.<br /><br />Now that you know how scene framing works, the game&#39;s basic tool kit should provide all you need to get the desired action-packed play.</p>
