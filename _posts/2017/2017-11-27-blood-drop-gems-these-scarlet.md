<b>*Blood Drop Gems*</b><br /><br />These scarlet gems are shaped as water drops and infused with the concentrated blood of many beings.  <br /> <br />Each gem contains d6 HPs and vary in size from a dime to a grapefruit depending on how many HP they contain. <br /> <br /><b>*When you are reduced to 0 HPs*</b> any Blood Drop Gems on your person will crumble to powder and grant you that many HP.  <br /> <br /><b>*When your life is preserved by a Blood Drop Gem*</b> you must permanently change something about your character to reflect the creature who&#39;s blood has become part of you. It might be a bond, flag, a look, or some other quirk.

        <p>This is really awesome for my campaign because I had the players start off inside a dragon that was large enough to swallow villages whole (in just such a village I called Gullet). The dragon had most of its biological systems composed of either gemstones or mineral deposits.<br /></p>

        <p><b>When you use a blood drop gem to cure yourself</b>, while still standing on your feet, gain that many HPs, and randomly change your alignment, or a bond, or your goal, until the end of your next session.</p>
