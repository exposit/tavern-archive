This zine!  Seriously. It has some rough edges and a few choices made me scratch my head, but forget that. There are so many fantastic nuggets in here! I&#39;m only halfway through looking it over, but I had to stop and post. It&#39;s pay what you want. It&#39;s Dungeon World. It&#39;s Necromunda+DarkSun-ish. I wish I had thought it up! It&#39;s really inspiring.

Get it now.

        <p>Yeah. I should have left out that first line about scratching my head. It sounds ominous but it&#39;s minor stuff. Stuff you expect in a zine really. And it is very much overshadowed by the good stuff. I&#39;ll make notes of the things I really dig and post a review here and on RPGDriveThru.</p>

        <p>That&#39;s really kind of you. I realized after three rounds of NaNoWriMo<br />(National Novel Writing Month) that I am a lot better at moving forward<br />when I have momentum. The editing part is where I drift away from my<br />projects. I thought about those old punk zines I used to look through and<br />realized there was a way for me to share my ideas. I can express my love<br />for Dungeon World and storytelling in a wave of excitement and let it go<br />before I start worrying over the details too much. That doesn&#39;t mean I<br />don&#39;t care about making it better. It just means momentum is more important<br />to my process than polish because I probably wouldn&#39;t complete a single<br />issue if I felt like it had to be perfect.<br /><br />I welcome any suggestions and guidance you have to offer. I really respect<br />your work.</p>

        <p>Exactly. I think yours have way more &#39;zine spirit&#39; than mine do. I polish mine a lot, which is cool but it means I am much slower from start to finish and, yeah, I risk losing energy. I kind of like revising, editing, and tightening the text up though.</p>
