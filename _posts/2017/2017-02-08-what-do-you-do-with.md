What do you do with the Fighter&#39;s &quot;Signature Weapon&quot; should they fall?<br /><br />Assuming the party can &quot;loot&quot; it off their corpse of course. It&#39;s not relevant to any of the games I&#39;m part of or running, just a curiosity.

        <p>Huh. Well, assuming there isn&#39;t something magical, spiritual, or supernatural imbued in the blade, I would say anyone could use it. But, I wouldn&#39;t give the character the actual <b>Signature Weapon</b> move until they took it with mutli-class advancement.</p>

        <p>i mean, theoretically it&#39;s just like any other weapon. But it&#39;s not. What&#39;s the point of having a fighter if their weapon is just another weapon? Their weapon allows them to call aid from their ancestors, they have enchanted their own weapon with their own hands. Plus, look at the Signature Weapon move itself: &quot;Your weapon, without you, is useless. Without your weapon, you are useless.&quot;<br />The fighter&#39;s weapon is unique and bonded to them through ways nobody can quite understand.<br />Make that known through the fiction.</p>

        <p>Just to add to the consensus but I&#39;d say that in the hands of anybody else it&#39;s just a regular weapon or completely inert due to the inherent magic / supernatural nature etc.<br /><br />I would add though that should the fighter fall and the party recover the weapon they&#39;ve just handed you a great opening for the fiction. Maybe they need to see it passed to the fighters heir before their soul will rest. Or maybe they need to find somebody worthy of taking up the mantle it represents.</p>

I thought that would be pretty entertaining.</p>
