The party gets some disappointing news before heading out into the desert with a horse with no name. But will Stink-eye's "navigation" to his home town be a shortcut or put the party into danger? Starring Mike(Big Boss Dungeoneer), Jeffrey(Luddy), Verge(Kadrian), Brandt(Stink-eye) and Craig(Tomas). dungeoneerspodcast.com | facebook.com/dungeoneerspodcast | @dungeoneerspod
