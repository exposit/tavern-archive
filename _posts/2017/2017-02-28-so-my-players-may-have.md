So, my players may have killed a usurping goddess, suckered the original god before he could reclaim his deific status. To be fair, the usurper was planning to masacre the players home country (and probably kill several other gods) and the original god was a god of treachery (Though, for the record, I was going to have him not betray them, just to mess with their heads). The players gave the godhood to one of their hirelings (who was almost dead from the fighting.)<br /><br />The hireling in question was an aspiring bard, so I figure she will become a goddess of stories and songs. aside from the obvious upsets of a new goddess, and the loss of one of the &quot;Evil&quot; gods, I am trying to think of some small move to give the party, to represent their personal relationship with one of the gods<br /><br /><b>The Bard Queen&#39;s Favour</b><br />When you Share stories or songs with another person, roll +Cha. On a 10+, choose 2, on a 7-9, choose 1. <br />You find comfort in them, heal 1d6 damage. <br />You find inspiration in them, Take +1 forward <br />You reflect on you expiriences, Mark xp <br />They open up to you. ask one question from Charming and Open list.<br /><br />Any opinions on this?

        <p>Very cool.<br /><br />One thing i would add is make the move flavor relate closer to the new goddess. As its read now, i don&#39;t get the vibe the goddess is the one providing the blessing.<br /><br />Example: (nowhere near perfect)<br />&gt; The goddess finds your stories delightful and blesses you with her grace. Heal 1d6.<br />&gt; The stories are inspiring, with the goddess&#39;s strength reverberating within you, you can use this information in your endeavors. +1 forward.</p>
