Ideas for contests? My players came up with a fun sect. War like halflings that they have to get some information from. What I am looking for is ideas for contests. A combat contest would be good of course, what other fun custom moves or ideas do you have?

        <p>If they are like Hobbits:<br /><br />Cloud watching. Each must participate in the telling of a story as to what is happening amongst the clouds and gauge it on its popularity by the onlookers.<br /><br />Roll + the following<br />&gt; +1 if the villian has an unsuspected misfortune<br />&gt; +1 if the hero finds trouble<br />&gt; +1 if love is found or lost<br /><br />10+ gain 1 point and continue your story.<br />7-9 gain 1 point, and pass the story telling to another to continue.<br />6- loose a point and pass the story to another to continue. They receive +1 to their next roll.<br /><br />First to 5 points wins.<br /><br />Its a group story telling game for the entire table and some NPCs</p>

First contest is jump over it, which seems super easy. Next contest limbo against a halfling</p>
