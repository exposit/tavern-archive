I was fiddling around with Freebooters on the Frontier Spell Names list and rolled a couple interesting ones. I like what I&#39;m seeing in FotF, but am really just looking for some interesting ideas for spells that my son&#39;s DW wizard might find in a forgotten library.  <br /><br />Remiry&#39;s Oozing Cosmos (3rd level?)<br />Describe an object that you would probably carry but don&#39;t have with you. Multiple realities bubble and coalesce around you and the object you described oozes out of a parallel universe, landing within reach.<br /><br />Hazdok&#39;s Incredible Avarice (5th, maybe 7th?)<br />Objects of great value call out to you to be found. The GM will tell you the approximate distance and direction to some valuable treasure. <br /><br />How can I improve these please? <br />

        <p>How do you want to improve them? What are they lacking for your game?</p>

        <p>I guess I could have spelled it out a little better lol... I mean based on the spell names I rolled up can I get some help with the descriptions / effects? This was just a first pass at them.  </p>

        <p>And I really like the idea of making Remiry&#39;s spell a move. A fail consequence could be &quot;an item you usually carry disappears into another reality&quot;.</p>
