Vilstrak (Marl Muggers)<br />Humanoid insect, subterranean,<br />4hp 4ap<br />Clubbing fists, b(2d4)+1<br />*meld into stone<br />*steal interlopers<br />Instincts: protect the queen. Travel in threes.<br />Alien insectile and stony, unknowable and silent, Vilstrak have little drive save to dig, expand the hive, and devour gems and minerals.<br />Attacking with mantis like rock hard arms, Vilstrak often use guerilla hit-and-phase out tactics making use of their warrens of tunnels and sealed chambers. Adapted to darkness they use Ultravision and sonar to navigate.<br />Inside their stomachs can usually be found craw-polished gem stones and the odd nugget of unusual indigestible metals.
