<b>Reaction Check</b><br />When you <b><i>approach a wary or hostile NPC and try to communicate</i></b>, roll +CHA: <b>on a 10+</b>, they&#39;ll hear you out and choose 2; <b>on a 7-9</b>, they&#39;ll hear you out and choose 1.<br />• They are impressed, intrigued, or amused by you, as the GM sees fit <i>(otherwise, they remain wary or hostile)</i><br />• You&#39;ve got their complete attention, for now at least <i>(otherwise, they remain alert)</i><br />• You glean a valuable insight; ask a question from the Discern Realities list at take +1 forward to act on the answer<br />

        <p>I love this. Cha based uses are rare in DW, This is golden.</p>

        <p>Reaction rolls are way underused in DW. I&#39;d like to see somethig like this incorporated into the PW style Danger encounters</p>

It&#39;s just &quot;a Danger is there, GM decides what&#39;s up&quot;.</p>

        <p>I love the implications of the second choice - something you&#39;d only choose if you were trying to pull a swift one on them (&quot;While you talk with them and get their attention, I&#39;ll sneak around and...&quot;)<br /><br />The trigger could occur even during a fight though.  I&#39;m not sure how I feel about that.  On the one hand, it would be very useful as a way to try to stop a conflict that had already broken out.  On the other, I feel that it might be a bit too easy to trigger - like, if you&#39;d already started talking with them, then your companions back-stabbed them and a fight broke out, you shouldn&#39;t be able to try talking again.<br /><br />Although perhaps it&#39;s just a case of GM judgement, like whether attacking a dragon using a mundane sword triggers Hack and Slash.<br /></p>

The tables for creatures all indicate that you should roll on both the Activity and Disposition tables, and the Disposition table is exactly the kind of thing you&#39;re describing (1: Attacking; 2-4: Hostile/Aggressive; 5-6 cautious/doubtful, etc.).<br /><br />This move would then give you a way to resolve a playing trying to get a hostile/wary creature to talk to you.</p>

Glad it came across!  <br /><br />Regarding the move triggering during a fight... I think it&#39;s fine. There&#39;s definitely a moment of judgement, like whether H&amp;S triggers.  And if you <i>do</i> manage to get it to work during a fight, the 10+ means they&#39;ll hear you out. It doesn&#39;t mean the fight is over... just maybe that it&#39;s on pause while you have some dialogue.  It&#39;s tense and everyone&#39;s jockying for position and the bloodshed could resume any moment!</p>

        <p>Could you tell us more about the niche that this would fill? Where in between Parley and Defy Danger with Charisma does this move lie?<br /><br />When I mentally compare this to Defy Danger, it seems powerful. Maybe as an advanced move, I would keep it as-is, but as a basic move, it needs to be trimmed back.</p>

        <p><span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink" href="https://plus.google.com/113692337653837882568" oid="113692337653837882568">Peter J</a></span> as far the niche this fills:<br />1) It&#39;s a callback to old school play<br />2) It encourages a sort of fairy tale/fantastic setting where high Charisma is universally appealing, regardless of species/cultural norm.  Which is both a hugely problematic but hugely interesting trope.  <br />3) It&#39;s an encouragement to &quot;try talking first&quot; instead of reacting to hostility with hostility<br /><br />That #2 is why I want it to be better than Defy Danger.  Defy Danger is pretty much the worst move you can make as a player (only RAW Aid is worse).  It forms the baseline, sure, but Defend, Discern Realities, Spout Lore, and Volley are all considerably <i>better</i> moves to make from a risk/benefit standpoint.<br /><br />However!  I agree that this is <i>too</i> good as written.  Mostly because on a 7-9, you can get the benefit of a 7-9 Discern Realities <i>and</i> you get them to hear you out.<br /><br />So... possible rewrites would be:<br /><br />option a) On a 10+, they hear you out and choose 1; on a 7-9, they hear you out.<br /><br />option b) as-is, but add a complication on the 7-9 result (either freeform or from a list?)<br /><br />option c) as option a, but let them choose 1 extra option if they accept a complication.<br /><br /><br />...and of those, option A seems the right one to me.</p>

        <p>I agree, I think that A is the best option of the three. <br /><br />I&#39;m naturally wary of moves that can be exploited as &quot;Parley without leverage&quot;, but I don&#39;t think this will cross that line. It can improve the subject&#39;s disposition to you, but they&#39;re still not going to do something they normally wouldn&#39;t without leverage. <br /><br />That being said, maybe tweak the trigger a little? If the NPC isn&#39;t interested in talking, this shouldn&#39;t be an out to get them to stop hitting you simply because you pushed the right button and rolled high enough.</p>

Maybe if it was something like &quot;When you approach a wary NPC and try to act friendly&quot; it would seem more like a reaction roll (instead of something you can try to do with every enemy, even in combat).<br /><br />Having said that, option A is the best, and I also think that this type of move could have something like &quot;on a 6-, the GM chooses 1 option.&quot;</p>
