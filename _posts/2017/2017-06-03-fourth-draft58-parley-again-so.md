<b>Fourth Draft: Parley (again)</b><br />So, I said I was done with this and I even changed my moves sheet to use a boring old crib on AW 2e&#39;s Seduce/Manipulate.  But then this happened.<br /><br />It&#39;s actually much closer to the root inspiration (Freebooting Venus&#39;s <b>Demand Something</b> move, as described <span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink" href="https://plus.google.com/113864117304127544117" oid="113864117304127544117">Johnstone Metzger</a></span>) than any of the previous drafts. And it gives up on the Petitioner/Granter framework I was going for.<br /><br />In the Demand Something move, the trigger is easily met (&quot;When you demand something of someone&quot;) and doesn&#39;t require any leverage. The result then determines if there&#39;s 1 requirement (on a 10+) or 2 (on a 7-9).  But what goes unstated in the move is that the requirements can have already been met in the triggering of the move.  So on a 10+, the GM could decide that they&#39;ll do it if you have and apply leverage over them but you already did that, so whatever, they do it.<br /><br />In this version, I tried to make that an explicit choice for the GM on a 10+. And on a 7-9, there will always be at least 1 requirement, no matter how well positioned you were before hand.  <br /><br />So, we keep the open trigger (&quot;press or entice someone into a course of action&quot;) without requiring the &quot;do you have leverage&quot; conversation, but keep the move from being mind control by allowing the GM to decide on a requirement on a 10+.  And while there&#39;s overlap in the 10+ and 7-9 results (e.g. in both cases, the GM could choose 1 requirement), I <i>think</i> this frames the decision for the GM in such a way that the results will feel different.<br /><br />As always:  feedback and questions appreciated!
