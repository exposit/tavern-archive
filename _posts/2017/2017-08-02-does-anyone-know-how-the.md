Does anyone know how the Compendium Classes (Blob, Bearer, Dragonslayer etc.) are meant to be used, they don&#39;t seem to be full classes like the standard ones in the rules. Thanks.

        <p>This should be addressed in whatever document you found them in, but:<br /><br />Compendium classes are basically like prestige classes in Dungeons and Dragons 3.5. You start out as some other, fully fleshed out, class. Once you meet the requirements for the compendium class, you can take its first move the next time you level up. After you&#39;ve done this, the rest of the compendium class&#39;s moves are treated as playbook moves for you, meaning that you can select them when you gain a level as if they were on your playbook sheet.</p>

        <p>See page 349: &quot;A compendium class is a class only available to higher level characters who meet specific requirements. Theyâ€™re called compendium classes because they first appeared in the Compendiums for Dungeon World Basic. A compendium class is the way to go for a concept that can be layered onto multiple other classes.&quot;<br /><a href="http://www.book.dwgazetteer.com/advanced_delving.html" data-embed="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" data-attachment-render-hint="1" class="ot-anchor">http://www.book.dwgazetteer.com/advanced_delving.html</a></p>
