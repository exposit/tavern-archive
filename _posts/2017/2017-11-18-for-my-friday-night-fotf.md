For my Friday night FotF group, I&#39;ve re-written the Dungeon World move &quot;Turn Undead&quot; as follows. We play with 2d12s, so scale move results accordingly.<br /><br />TURN==============<br />Each time you take this move, choose a specific type of creature or and enemy of your faith that you can turn: <br />o Undead<br />o Demons/Devils<br />o Lycanthropes<br />o Elementals<br />o Paladins/Clerics of opposed alignment<br />o Heretics <i>____________</i><br />o Followers of the Deity <i>__________________</i><br /><br />When you hold your Diety’s symbol aloft and call upon Divine power to turn, roll +WIS: <br /><br />24+ : Hold 5<br />20+ : Hold 3;  <br />13–19 : Hold 1<br />12– : Mark XP; The GM makes a move. You may not attempt to turn this individual or group again until you level up.<br />2– : As above, but expect the worst.<br /><br />Spend hold as follows:<br />1h:	The turning is successful with duration 1.<br />1h:	Increase duration by 1.<br />1h:	Among those turned, the intelligent are momentarily dazed; the mindless flee.<br />1h:	One intelligent or LEVEL mindless turned creatures are dealt damage equal to your current favor. Any creature that would be destroyed by this damage may instead be compelled by the cleric.<br /><br />So long as you continue turning,  no turned creature may come within reach of you. The turned may find ways to harry you from afar.<br /><br />If you succeed with a split (13) or better, you may make this move again against the same opponent(s).
