I&#39;m looking for players for a series of  <b>Powered by the Apocalypse</b> mini-campaigns! <br /><br />I have been itching to play the PbtA games I have accumulated for a while now. I would like to get a semi-regular group going on Fridays after 8pm to 11pm-12am EST( GMT -5). I&#39;m thinking we could do 1-3 months (4 to 16 sessions)  campaigns of a series of different games with one-shots in between if we are missing a player or if we have someone jumping in. <br /><br />I&#39;m looking for 3-4 players who can commit for most Friday nights and who are exited to play Powered by the Apocalypse games. I would GM most of the time but I wouldn&#39;t mind being a player every once in a while too.  I plan on using Roll20 + Skype (voice and camera) with an option to switch to Discord when they offer a video option. <br /><br />Here&#39;s a non-restrictive list of the games I would like to try: <br /><br />-Dungeon World<br />-The Sprawl<br />-Uncharted World<br />-Urban Shadows<br />-Apocalypse World<br />-The Veil<br />-A super exclusive unreleased Johnstone Metzger game of Not-Game of thrones. <br />-Impulse Drive<br />-The Regiment <br />-Worlds in peril<br />and many more

        <p>I might be interested. It&#39;s perhaps asking a bit much for up to a 3 month commitment but something more like 1 month I could realistically manage. I&#39;ll keep an ear out and see what comes of this.</p>

I&#39;m pretty sure we will play a particular game for 3 to 6 sessions in reality.</p>
