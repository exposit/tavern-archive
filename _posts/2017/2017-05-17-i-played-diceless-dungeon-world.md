I played diceless Dungeon World with some children at work lately. Some important realisations were had...

This blog has been fairly quiet of late, because for the last month and a half or so the only RPG-related stuff Iâ€™ve been doing has been at work (or working on a game for an upcoming convention, but I'll talk about that later...

        <p>That&#39;s really interesting!  Also really encouraging, that you saw a good number of failures and partial successes when they were just deciding what they rolled rather than actually rolling.<br /><br />Were they earning XP on a 6- as well?  Or was that part of the mechanics that you were glossing over?<br /><br />Out of interest, was there much social pressure happening with how they decided they rolled?  Like, if one particular kid repeatedly said they rolled a 10+, did the other kids start to make &quot;really?&quot; noises?</p>

Not at all at first, but once we got to like the last day of the program and everyone knew the score there were a couple of &quot;hmmmm&quot; noises. <br /><br />Though that was less at kids repeatedly 10+ing (I can&#39;t think of anyone who did at that point, actually), and more at kids who were like &quot;9, wait, no, 10!&quot; and pushed themselves up that next margin of success.</p>
