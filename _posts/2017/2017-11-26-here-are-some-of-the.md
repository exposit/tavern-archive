Here are some of the latest moves for our practically GM-less FotF campaign. <br /><br />WORLDBUILDING MOVES============<br /><br />HAND OF THE CREATOR<br />When you Level Up, take a turn at the Microscope game that interacts with our campaign world. You may create a period, event, or scene. Every five levels, you get a double turn, as if you were the &quot;lens&quot;, and every other player at the table gets to follow you with a turn of their own. <br /> <br />A FANTASTIC WORLD <br />When you want to establish something about the game world that&#39;s at a macro-level—something that your character should be able to establish or perceive—say what it is and then roll +nothing: <br />(+) It&#39;s true and then some. Establish 2 or 3 facts/details about the subject.<br />(=) What you say is true. Establish 1 fact/detail about the subject.<br />(–) It isn&#39;t true. <br /><br />
