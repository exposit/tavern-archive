Out of curiosity,  does anyone know of one or more (preferrably several) playbooks that would work really well to emulate fighting game characters?

        <p>Depends on the game. We talking Darkstalkers, Mortal Combat, Street Fighter, Marvel v. Capcom? If you need a bunch of all new playbooks you might check out Class Warfare.</p>

        <p>Does it strictly speaking, have to depend on the game?  I already have Class Warfare (and have already come to the conclusion that Wielder will work for part of a Soul Calibur character), but I&#39;d prefer to minimize delving into it by going the existing playbook route.</p>

        <p>Or perhaps playbooks for several (maybe 10) broad types, like the one Eddy Gordo might use could be called a Dancer, where the one that Steve Fox might use could be called a Boxer, etc. Just, ya know, a variety.</p>

        <p>What precise aspect of fighting game characters are you looking to emulate? In general, fighting games are focused on tactics and precision, which isn&#39;t really the focus of Dungeon World. If that&#39;s what you&#39;re after, you might be better served by, for example, <i>Fight! The Fighting Game RPG.</i><br /><br />If you just want to capture certain aesthetics, fighting game characters are crazy diverse, which is why it depends on the game and the specific characters.</p>

        <p>What I&#39;m trying to tell you is that I want literally all of it, or as much of it as possible. If you can&#39;t give me broad strokes, you can&#39;t help me.</p>

        <p>You&#39;re not wrong about Fight! The Fighting Game RPG though. I&#39;m basically looking for a number of pre-made playbooks that when compiled together will basically make FTFGRPG into a DW hack whenever you add in some moves specific to fighting games. I&#39;ll come up with those as inspiration strikes. I&#39;m looking for a springboard for the inspiration.<br /></p>

        <p>Not exactly what you are looking for but I know there&#39;s a vampire hunter playbook which emulates Belmont from Castlevania out there.</p>

        <p>that&#39;s (probably) a start. Do you know if it&#39;s one for sale, or from someone&#39;s personal dropbox?</p>

        <p>I&#39;ve long wanted to play a game in the vein of fighting games, but I have to say I&#39;m not sure there&#39;s enough of a difference between Eddy Gordo, Terry Bogart, Scorpion, etc to make individual playbooks out of them.<br /><br />Are you familiar with the Battle mind? It covers martial arts in an interesting way.<br /><br /><a href="http://apocalypse-world.com/forums/index.php?topic=2987.0" class="ot-anchor">http://apocalypse-world.com/forums/index.php?topic=2987.0</a></p>

        <p>How do you envision this game going? Like I said, I&#39;ve long wanted to do a fighting game RPG, but I&#39;ve never really had a clear vision for how to make it work. <br /><br />Also, I assume you are familiar with the Street Fighter RPG?<br /><br /><a href="https://rpggeek.com/rpg/488/street-fighter-storytelling-game" class="ot-anchor">https://rpggeek.com/rpg/488/street-fighter-storytelling-game</a></p>

        <p>I had a couple ideas. One would involve players fighting earth gods across various mythologies, and the other would be a Soul Calibur reboot where Zasalamel&#39;s ending in SCIV comes to pass and the players are all modern day characters. Not sure I want to do the second one as it&#39;s a bit of a contrivance why modern characters have to use archaic weapons. It has the advantage of being less divisive by not incorporating real world myths (I use the academic/archaeological meaning of myth, not the parlance meaning). Probably will run it on my discord if possible.</p>

        <p>Also, maybe but if I ever obtained it, it would have been years ago, and I never got into ST games.</p>

        <p>Ahhh, okay so you&#39;re thinking more of the standard band of heroes against a big bad rather than the PvP style play of your standard fighting game. Interesting. Not what I envisioned, but interesting. So, what were you looking for in playbooks that said &quot; fighting game character&quot; to you? Most of the Soul Calibur cast could be handled by DW fighter, I would think.</p>

        <p>Since I asked this question, I found Cursed Knight, (something that looks a bit like Nightmare from SC) Gladiator, (which doesn&#39;t quite look like the sword and shield females from the same series, but was an interesting pick up) Initiate (which fits several ideas), a different kind of Monk, (which fits the same ideas differently) Mentor, (which fits some characters from some games that are very old) Brute and Wrestler. (which fit bar brawler types, and luchadores) Dancer, (which doesn&#39;t quite match fighting game characters whose style mimics dancing but is close) Ninja and Samurai.<br /><br />On the subject of Soul Calibur characters, they don&#39;t even need the full fighter class, they could just add the Class Warfare Wielder, which is something I&#39;ve already been thinking about. <br /><br />On the subject of game themes, one of them would be co-op (unless particular players decided they identified with some of the gods and tag teamed against the rest of the players with the god) while the other would depend on the specific scenario.</p>
