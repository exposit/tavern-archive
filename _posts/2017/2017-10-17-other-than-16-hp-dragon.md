Other than 16 hp dragon, which other examples capture the dungeon world concepts.  <br /><br />I&#39;m working on my own take 16hp dragon for  why zombies are a threat in dw and looking for additional inspiration <br />

        <p>I was thinking about some kind of &#39;mob&#39; tag. Every zombie after the first in close gives -1 forward to players. <br /><br />Or <br /><br />whenever taking damage from zombies. +1 damage for every other zombie in close. <br /><br />Something that keeps players from wading into them and encourage either bottle necking tactics. Or at least making getting over run more dangerous.</p>

        <p>The genie doesn&#39;t have any health. You can&#39;t hurt a god like being with near unlimited power over the cosmos... A solid wack from a hammer will break his lamp for sure though.</p>

The moves snowballed as they closed in, they closed to &quot;hand&quot; range, and tried to grab her by a limb. She got a 7â€“9 on Defy Danger and they ripped her backpack open and she lost her supplies, and hands were still grabbing and clawing from every direction.<br /><br />A few beats later, she had taken a bad bite to her shoulder, and she decided to fight them off gripping arrows from her quiver as daggers. But she rolled poorly on H&amp;S. At that point, the hard move was brutal: With zombies clutching her limbs, there was a snap and they tore her arm off at the wounded shoulder.<br /><br />Her wolf intervened, creating a distraction, and she was able to get away, while a few zombies struggled to claim the abandoned arm.<br /><br />I can&#39;t even remember if we did the +1 damage per additional zombie, but the player was not complaining that the zombies fell down too easily.<br /><br />She was hardcore though, and she became the type of Ranger who still gets off perfect shots by drawing the bow with her teeth.</p>

        <p>I find it pretty amusing that the 16HP dragon is such a part of the philosophy that &#39;dangerous enemy&#39; now seems inevitably defined as &#39;lost arm.&#39; :P</p>

Yes?<br /><br />And that you are intending to write a similar article, but about a zombie horde. Yes?</p>

        <p>Jeremy, that is correct just looking for other actual play write ups with big bads that show the mechanics.   Just for extra inspiration.   Nothing more.</p>
