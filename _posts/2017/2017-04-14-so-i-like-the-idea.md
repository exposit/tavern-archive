So I like the idea of dungeon starters. I haven&#39;t seen one that was just a map. I did this afternoon with a bit of free time. I used generic names but tried to put enough there to spark the imagination. <br /><br />From here looking at the map you could use for a first session. What questions naturally come up when you see this map? Then you can make it less generic and start filling in some details during character creation. <br /><br />You can put some themes that you may want in the game by your initial questions. I may come up with three different sets of questions to go with this map for different kind of campaigns. Example: if the first question you have to a player is &quot;which one of the vassal baronies have you come from, why are you loyal to the rebellious Baron. Name him.&quot; is a very different question from &quot;why has the High King summoned you to his court from the vassal baronies. Which loyal Baron are you representing, and why is the call so urgent?&quot; .<br /><br />I am not saying this is a very good map, there are plenty out there on the internet but I made this one specifically for dungeon world, and I give permission for any and all to use for any use they want (just keep the signature on it). I did it pencil with calligraphy pen. It is obviously a throwback to medieval europe with some Alberta Badlands thrown in.

        <p>Neat!  I&#39;ve thought about doing something similar. I think I <i>would</i> put specific names on the map, mostly because I think they spur a lot of creativity at the table.  Plus, it lets you set a cultural tone.<br /><br />(Also: I suck at making up good names on the fly.)</p>

        <p>I would put more than place names, I would put &quot;impressions&quot; and neat phrases on the map.<br /><br />Harden&#39;s Reach<br />- Only the bold survive<br />- The High Path<br /><br />Inglor Swamp<br />- Like the smell of a dying beast<br />- Those below grasp for more</p>

        <p>Yeah I thought about that. But at the same time I wanted this to be reusable or useable for many. Usually for me I have lots of ideas but take a long time to get a good map, so I wanted this to be generic. I do like the idea of putting names and impressions on them. I might do that now that I have the map scanned. I invite others to take the map and make names and impressions on like Aaron suggested.</p>
