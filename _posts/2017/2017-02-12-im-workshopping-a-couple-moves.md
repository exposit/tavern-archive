I&#39;m workshopping a couple moves.<br /><br />a bit of backstory: My players are about to assault  a goddesses keep, and I want a way to deal with an opponent so superior to them, that going toe to toe with them is functionally suicide. To this end, I designed two custom moves for fighting her.<br /><br /><b>*Invincible*</b><br /><br />When you deal damage to Einora without an opening, the damage is negated, and she instead turns her wrath upon you.<br /><br /><b>*Wrath of the goddess*</b><br />When you  face the full wrath of Einora, roll + Dex (If dancing away and evading) or +Str (if blocking, parrying and otherwise goign toe to toe with her). On a 10+, choose 2, on a 7-9, choose 1:<br />*You evade or endure her onslaught<br />*You create an opening for an ally (Name who)<br />* You land a blow on her<br /><br />can I get some feedback?

        <p>Is the first move meant to represent her unassailable skill at arms? Or the fact that she&#39;s, like, literally invulnerable to their attacks.<br /><br />Assuming it&#39;s the former, I&#39;d make the trigger  the <i>attack</i> and not the damage. I&#39;d probably also crank up the language to pretty epic levels.  Something like...<br /><br /><b>Invincible</b><br />When you are so foolish as to attack Einora directly, without taking advantage of an established opening, she deftly counters your feeble efforts and... (GM picks 1)<br />* Launches a lethal counterattack, what do you do?<br />* Dances past/around/away from/over to you, faster than you can blink<br />*  Flicks your weapon from your grasp, sends you tumbling, stuns you, and/or otherwise shows her disdain for the inconsequential threat you pose<br /><br /><br />As for <b>Wrath of the Goddess</b>, I wouldn&#39;t bother. It&#39;s actually <i>super forgiving</i>, significantly better than simply Defying Danger.  It also takes away player agency, because they don&#39;t get to choose how to respond.<br /><br />You don&#39;t need it to establish &quot;openings,&quot; because there are already plenty of ways to do that, both mechanically and fictionally.  A PC might Defend against her and spend 1 hold to give an ally an opening. Or they might Discern Realities and look for something useful to them, or something that isn&#39;t what it seems.  Or move into flanking position (probably Defying Danger to do so) and then Aid their ally.  Or, like, collapse the building on her and while she&#39;s dodging that put an arrow in her side.</p>

        <p>I don&#39;t really think you even need moves for this. (Which is not to say <span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink" href="https://plus.google.com/102595580176380683252" oid="102595580176380683252">Jeremy Strandberg</a></span>&#39;s moves don&#39;t work, because they&#39;re awesome.) What I&#39;m saying is that fiction alone should work here.<br /><br />The character&#39;s opponent is a <i>goddess</i>. What weapons do they have that could mar her divine flesh? What magic can they throw at her that she could not undo with a snap of her fingers? How could they hope to deceive an omniscient being?<br /><br />If you really want the characters to go up against a foe so vastly superior to them it&#39;s suicide, you could just narrate things appropriately,</p>

        <p>Oh, yeah, what <span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink" href="https://plus.google.com/108053817066303198241" oid="108053817066303198241">Chris Stone-Bush</a></span> says is totally true. I read the <i>intent</i> of your moves more as &quot;this should be a really, really hard fight&quot; but not <i>impossible</i>, like going up against Wonder Woman as opposed to, like, fighting Superman without any kryptonite. <br /><br />Even so, you could technically get that with just a monster move or two, like &quot;Counter all but the most inspired of attacks.&quot;<br /><br />I do like having it written as a player-facing move, though. Not so much because I&#39;d show it to the players, but rather to give myself permission to do that stuff in the heat of the moment.</p>

        <p>I too am a little unsure if this is meant to be a fight that&#39;s impossible to win, or just really unlikely.<br /><br />I do agree with <span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink" href="https://plus.google.com/102595580176380683252" oid="102595580176380683252">Jeremy Strandberg</a></span>&#39;s reason for writing down the move. Writing out custom moves has reminded me that I have permission to do really nasty stuff. :D</p>

        <p>it is more of a wonder-woman fight. this goddess is still corporeal, without a heavenly/infernal realm (She recently stole divinity from another god, who is currently travelling with the party).<br /><br />she is vulnerable to divine weapons (weapons forged of divine ore, which is basically concentrated godly will. ) she is also moderately vulbnerable to magic (It takes a lot to hurt her) and the fighter&#39;s weaon is infused wih the will of a demon lord (long story) so it will wound, but not kill, her.</p>

        <p>I, for one, would <i>love</i> to hear how this fight goes.</p>

        <p>I would do something similar to what&#39;s already been suggested then.<br /><br />An alternative is to write these out as monster moves and give the goddess truly formidable stats.</p>

        <p>If the players don&#39;t already know her power, it may be a good idea to make sure to show it first. Have some monster/NPC make an attack at her that she effortlessly deflects, and show her force as a counter attack. Unless you&#39;re specifically planning for a player to have their opening attack utterly fail.</p>

        <p>As Jeremy wanted an update, I&#39;ll say that, as of right now, the party is within the goddess&#39;  stronghold, and are 3 misses away from The Lady of Treason&#39;s army descending upon them, and 5 away from Einora herself appearing.<br /><br />the Battlemaster and Fighter are engaged with the honour guard, the channeler&#39;s arm was just turned to stone,  the Cleric is surrounded, and The Templar  is dangling from the top of the wall, and under fire.<br /><br />things are going well</p>
