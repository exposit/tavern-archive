One of my groups just wrapped up a Dungeon World campaign, so we&#39;re planning to play a few one-shots from various systems while we prep for our next campaign.  I&#39;ve taken on running a one-shot in Apocalypse World, which is a game I&#39;ve always wanted to try.  Up to now, my only experience has been running Dungeon World; Apocalypse World looks very similar, mechanically, but with less focus on heroics and nods to D&amp;D mechanics and more possibilities for inter-character conflicts, as well as interesting principles like &quot;Respond with fuckery and intermittent rewards.&quot;<br /><br />For those of you who&#39;ve run both systems, what do you wish you&#39;d known going in the first time you ran Apocalypse World?

        <p>Ok, so I haven&#39;t run both. But I&#39;ve run lots of DW, and just played in my first AW game (which was excellent). I think the player conflict (PvP) part would come up more, and so understanding how to deal with that. <br /><br />I&#39;m also curious what split of people just define the Holding in game but assume a setting with the flavor of the rules (mad max-ish?), versus do a full on &quot;what&#39;s the world like&quot; type roundtable, where you end up with any sort of crazy (waterworld, alien invader apocalypse, etc.)</p>

        <p>It&#39;s hard to do true one-shots with PbtA games because charactr creation takes up quite a bit of the first session.<br /><br />The most important thing, IMO, about taking DW players (or more traditional RPG players) into Apocalypse World or Urban Shadows or similar is that <b>you&#39;re not a party</b>. Everyone is capable and sufficient on their own, and don&#39;t rely on the others simply to get through some dungeon. You might need assistance from others sometimes, but those favors shouldn&#39;t be given just because everyone is a PC.</p>

        <p>Just as an FYI, my understanding is that Apocalypse World doesn&#39;t really &#39;get going&#39; until the third or fourth sessions. Something to be aware of heading into a one shot scenario might be that it&#39;s not going to really shine without that backlog of events/story defined by the first pair of or few sessions.</p>

Stoke those conflicts, but also find out where they have had common ground. They aren&#39;t a party, but the story will be about how they interact (for good or ill)<br /></p>

I&#39;ve only had the fortune to play in one very brief AW game, and never at a con unfortunately, but I&#39;m primed for another opportunity. I think one of my goals this year is to run a game of 2nd Edition.<br /><br />Thanks for tips!</p>

        <p>I have mixed feelings about one-shots.  The trouble is that when you have a good one-shot, you can develop some really cool characters and settings in just that short period.  But then, it&#39;s like a promising new TV show that gets cancelled right after the pilot.  I want to find out what happens!  You play just long enough to get a taste for how the characters tick and the kinds of things that might develop.  It&#39;s still a lot of fun and it&#39;s great experience to explore a range of different characters, but there&#39;s almost always a part of me that wishes it could&#39;ve gone just a little bit longer.  Those momentary fragments of ephemeral experience vanish so quickly and mysteriously that it&#39;s almost as if they left before they even had a chance to arrive.  But I suppose that&#39;s as good a reason as any to come back to the table. :)</p>
