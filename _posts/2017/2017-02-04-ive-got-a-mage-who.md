I&#39;ve got a Mage who suggested a clever idea.<br /><br />What about a move where a non-Vancian wizard (like the Mage, but others too) could write spells into a spellbook, then incant those spells to repeat the magic?<br /><br />As in, they have their &quot;do magic&quot; move, but if they take time (maybe via ritual, or in a place of power) to reflect on some magic they&#39;ve performed, or witnessed, they can write the spell into a book -- a literal book, such that the player would keep their own unique log.<br /><br />Then, instead of doing the magic move, which can often have terrible effects, they could recite an incantation to achieve more reliable effects?<br /><br />The real question, I suppose, is what incentive there would be to doing magic once you&#39;d built up enough good spells -- or what downsides there would be to the spellbook.

        <p>Would they have to get the book out and actually reference it to cast the &quot;safer&quot; version? Cuz if so, that&#39;s the downside right there. Think of how much you can F with a mate trying to read a spell from their book in the middle of a fight.</p>

        <p>Yeah, the &#39;terrible effects&#39; of Cast a Spell have got nothing on the full list of GM Moves you open yourself up to when you don&#39;t have the narrative control that the dice grant you.<br /><br />(Though, The Mage&#39;s horribly written version doesn&#39;t really give you much narrative control anyway, so bleh.)</p>

        <p>Sounds like if you used Ritual to put your spells down on a scroll, which requires it&#39;s own costs. A scroll would be one use and of course, fragile/flammable. So it becomes a piece of equipment at that point, which unless it&#39;s a class given item we all know it&#39;s fair game for GM moves lol</p>

        <p>I think Scott is on point. Make scrolls. Or a book containing what are essentially scrolls. Ritually made, one time use scrolls. The parchment contains powerful magic that costs allot upfront, but little when casting.<br /><br />To that end, i don&#39;t require my players to roll to cast scrolls most of the time. Unless the situation is dangerous, in which case i require a DD</p>
