It's been five years. What a surprise.

        <p>I used to think about all the ways I would change my favorite RPGs to make them fit my play style. Then I ran into Dungeon World. I never feel the need to change what you&#39;ve done. Dungeon World is my role playing home. Thank you.</p>

        <p>Dungeon World is exactly what I wish D&amp;D had been all those decades ago when I discovered it.</p>

        <p>I don&#39;t think we&#39;ve ever gone below 2k in a run, though IIRC some were larger. And the BWHQ runs may also be larger.</p>

        <p>I have certainly enjoyed playing and running it (even if I did it wrong :) ). Thank you for DW.</p>

        <p>Dungeon world was not only my gateway back into playing and gaming RPGs, but also in to designing them.</p>

        <p>Well, thank you guys, had many unforgettable moments with your little big game. You know, i used to toss those big rolemaster tomes aside in the early &#39;90, just improvised along with maybe some notes quickly jotted down (Well, those tomes only came out for critical hits, which were actually fun). I was pretty amazed when i realized that your game - decades later - not only supported this style, but had nifty rules for it. So, kudos!</p>

        <p>DW was key to me as well. I remember reading it, running one game, and then feverishly writing Servants of the Cinder Queen over the course of 3 days. Thank you Sage and Adam (and <span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink" href="https://plus.google.com/107209917417545853482" oid="107209917417545853482">tony dowler</a></span> and Vincent and Meg) for getting me even more excited about RPGs than I was At the age of 10 in 1977.</p>

        <p>Outstanding work on this game. I remember coming across a blog post (or something, maybe it was just a character sheet) about character bonds that sat at the back of my mind while we finished our time with D&amp;D4th. When the time came to wrap that one up, I thought &quot;what was the game with that bonds stuff in it called...&quot; and BOOM here we are.</p>
