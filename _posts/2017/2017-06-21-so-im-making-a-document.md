So I&#39;m making a document, mainly for myself but I will put it up on drive thru for others to use, of 200+ magic items converted from D&amp;D to use for Dungeon World, complete with random treasure tables to roll on. I am making a couple different &quot;_<i>____</i> Slayer&quot; items that are meant to deal with certain kinds of creatures. My question to the group is, would the weapon dealing more damage to that certain creature be appropriate? Or would something else be better? I thought maybe just ignoring any defenses of the creature would be good, but then I thought of giants wearing armor and it not making sense for a weapon to ignore their armor. Right now I just have them dealing 2d6 additional damage, but I thought that may be boring. <br /><br />I also considered something like this:<br /><br />When you <b>strike a creature this weapon was made to kill</b>, on a hit (7+) you deal an additional 1d6 damage. On a 7-9, the creature also realizes the nature of the weapon and acts accordingly. On a 12+ the creature is instantly slain.<br /><br />Is killing the creature outright on a 12+ too powerful? Say for like, a dragon or something similar. Let me know what you all think!

        <p>I have nothing to add other than that I will absolutely buy this when it comes out.</p>

        <p>I think it makes sense, you would just need to make &quot;dragon slaying&quot; weapons extremely rare, but &quot;orc slaying&quot; weapons might be more common.</p>

I would basically make a mini table you would roll on to see the creature type the slaying weapon gets when you find it. Dragon would definitely be a rare one :)</p>

        <p>I hadn&#39;t really thought of adventurers finding it, I rarely roll for loot though. In my mind it would be something that would be forged from some rare component of the target species... or a single use alchemical treatment for a weapon.  &quot;dragonsbane&quot; or something, &quot;apply to weapon to gain the following move for this encounter...&quot;</p>

My group loooooves random magic items lol. Of course, you can air drop in any of the items as your heart sees fit, without them being random.</p>

        <p>I would maybe throw some appropriate fiction in on 10+ rolls: <br /><br />on a 10+ you hamstring the giant<br />on a 10+ you clip the wing of the dragon <br />on a 10+ you poke the dragon in just the spot preventing belching flame for few moments<br />on a 10+ you take a limb off the troll, causing the troll to conserve as it regenerates the limb<br />on a 10+ you poke one of the roc&#39;s eyes out giving it a blind side for the rest of the fight<br /><br />I really like fictional elements. There can still be damage, and perhaps some other abilities (based on the weapon) like tags of messy, forceful, etc., but adding a special bit of fiction specific to the species the weapon is named slayer off would add uniqueness.</p>

        <p>I think I&#39;d make ~3 &quot;classes&quot; of slaying weapons, each with options for customization. The more powerful the weapon, the more specific the creature. Something like:<br /><br />*__* Bane:  GM, when you introduce this weapon, choose a general type of creature or monster, like &quot;orc,&quot; &quot;goblin,&quot; &quot;spirit,&quot; or &quot;dragon.&quot; Choose 2 properties from the following list:<br />* Against the named creatures, it deals +1d4 damage<br />* Against the named creatures, it is messy and forceful<br />* Against the named creatures, it ignores armor<br />* It fills the named creatures with fear; the craven among them will flee or grovel before it <br />* It glows in the presence of the named creatures<br />* It can harm named creatures as if they were mortal beings of flesh and blood<br /><br />Regardless, the named creatures can sense the power of the bane weapon when it is drawn, and respect it accordingly.<br /><br /><br /><br />* __* <b>Slayer</b>: GM, when you introduce this weapon, choose a specific type of creature or monster, like &quot;priests of Gruumsh,&quot; &quot;red dragons,&quot; &quot;spirits of darkness,&quot; or &quot;golems.&quot; Against the named creatures, it ignores armor and can harm them as if they were mortal beings of flesh and blood.<br /><br />Also, choose 2 properties from the following list:<br />* Against the named creatures, it deals +1d8 damage<br />* When you roll 12+ to Hack and Slash or otherwise attack the named creature, they are killed/destroyed/banished outright<br />* It fills the named creatures with dread and terror; all but the bravest will flee, and even they will hesitate<br />* It flares brilliantly in the presence of such creatures, making the avert their eyes (others are unaffected)<br /><br />The named creatures sense the power of the weapon, even when sheathed or hidden, and respect it accordingly.<br /><br /><br /><br />* __* <b>&#39;s Ruin</b>: GM, when you introduce this weapon, name a notable individual creature such as &quot;Duke Blackheart,&quot; &quot;Averoxinis the Dragon,&quot; or &quot;Orcus, Demon Prince of Death.&quot;  Against the named creature, it ignores armor and harms them as if they were mortal flesh and blood. <br /><br />Also, choose 1 property from the following list:<br />* The named creature cannot sense the weapon&#39;s power until it has been wounded by it<br />* When drawn in the named creature&#39;s presence, all of the creature&#39;s magical powers are negated<br />* When it deals 6 or more damage to the creature in a single blow, that creature is killed/destroyed/banished outright</p>
