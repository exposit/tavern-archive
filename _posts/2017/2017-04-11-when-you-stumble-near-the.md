When you stumble near the abyss of fire, roll 2d6+Dex.  10+ you regain balance and are fine.  7-9 you regain balance but choose one:. You lose something to the flames; Or you take  - 1 ongoing till you make camp. 6 or less means You have stumbled into into the abyss of fire.  No spell can protect you.  You will burn forever and ever in eternal torment.  You are no more.  <br /><br />When you reach the Deepest Dungeon roll 2d6+nothing.  7-9 You become Lord of the little people (gain 2d10 halfling followers) but the treasure is only within your sight, power beyond imagination for the winner, to wield for all eternity. (you must roll another 7+ to get it.) 10+ get both immediately.  Describe.  6- Fate turns against you, the dragon has you in its mouth, the dragon slowly closes it&#39;s mouth. <br /><br /> Choose 1.  Sacrifice the blood of one of the little people instead of yours to satisfy the Dragon.  Or lose all, die a horrible death, and lose THE POWER﻿

"Dungeons and Dragons, Satan's Game..." Ever wonder where the Dead Alewives probably got their inspiration for their D&D clip? Probably from this video. This...

        <p>Too simple or too complicated?  Better idea?  Please share.  <br /><br />(This clip comes from the 700 Club video called Lost without a Compass).  It&#39;s hilarious.</p>

        <p>For the first one, wouldn&#39;t this just fall under &quot;Defy Danger&quot; + DEX?</p>

It&#39;s a pretty hardcore hazard.  Thx for input.</p>

        <p>Is the fire &quot;magical&quot;? If not, a salamander Immolator would be immune to that damage. They&#39;re cozy in a pool of lava, so what makes the &quot;abyss of fire&quot; more threatening than any other non-magical (if extreme, like lava) fire damage?</p>

        <p>I don&#39;t create many custom moves because A) I&#39;m no good at it and B) More often than naught I end up just using DD instead. So what I normally do is create a hazard that is very similar mechanically to a monster: name, tags, damage (sometimes), description and moves. So my version of The Abyss of Fire would look like this:<br /><br /><b>The Abyss of Fire</b> <i>Magical</i><br /><b>(d6 damage, ignores armor, near)</b><br />Descriptiony goodness, including the bit about spells not being able to save you, plus anything else about it that&#39;s interesting and/or useful.<br />*<i>Kiss with flame</i><br />*<i>Utterly Consume</i><br /><br />So now it&#39;s an asset that characters can Discern Realities or Spout Lore about and you have the answers in the description, and you can say characters must Defy Danger just to walk near it. 10+ all is good, 7-9 they stumble (or flinch or or hesitate) and you can offer a worse outcome, hard bargain or ugly choice. 6- doesn&#39;t automatically mean death in this case (although you&#39;re obviously free to use Utterly Consume here)<br /><br />Kiss with flame is your &quot;lose something, fear, deal a little damage (which is why I included the damage above)&quot; move.<br /><br />Later if you decide it would be cool if it could do more stuff, you can add a little bit about it in the description and add another move. For example, it also prevents magic items from working in it&#39;s presence. Add something about that to the description and put *<i>Negate Magic Items</i> on the move list.<br /><br />Now when someone uses their Thing of Whatever and looks to you to see what happens you (EDIT <del>describe how</del>) can use the <i>Negate Magic Item</i> move and describe that their Thing of Whatever isn&#39;t doing what it&#39;s supposed to do.<br /><br />Certainly that&#39;s not to everyone&#39;s liking, but I do this way more times than I successfully create a custom move lol.</p>

Since there is no protection against it, I believe it will hurt even salamanders.</p>

That&#39;s why no spell or armor or racial trait can save you if you fall.  Magic works around the abyss, but not if you fall in.</p>

        <p>It sounds cool. I&#39;ll probably use it myself at some point.</p>
