Version 1.4 of <i>Fourth World</i>, my hack of <a rel="nofollow" class="ot-hashtag" href="https://plus.google.com/s/%23DungeonWorld/posts">#DungeonWorld</a> to support the setting of <a rel="nofollow" class="ot-hashtag" href="https://plus.google.com/s/%23Earthdawn/posts">#Earthdawn</a> is finally done. Details at  the link.<br /><br />These revisions started to feel suspiciously like work, so took way longer than necessary.﻿

Almost exactly a year ago, when I published “probably the last revision I'll do” of this hack of Dungeon World to the Earthdawn setting, I really thought I was done.

        <p>This made my day as a gamer! I always wanted to get back into ED again, but dreaded having to get others to read the books or to deal with interacting with the system again!<br /><br />Thank you so very much for all the hard work!</p>

The layout sources are included in the links on the page.<br /><br />Personally, I find the layout to work great for me. I bring up a PDF reader and put it in full screen mode. The landscape format works great on laptop screens. The format is also intended to fit each discipline on two pages, so you can print pseudo-sheets for each on the front and back of one piece of paper.</p>

        <p>Interesting. What version of Earthdawn did you start with as your foundation? What drove the project - why the desire to replace the native mechanics?</p>

        <p>I only ever played the first edition, so most of my impressions are from there. I read the others (except the most recent, Kickstarted one, as it didn&#39;t exist when I first wrote this). If I had to do it all over again, instead of cannibalising the Dungeon World playbooks, I would have started from the discipline descriptions in the third edition <i>Players Companion</i> and built the moves to capture the feel described there. The result would have been a lot different, I think.<br /><br />As for why, well, because Earthdawn was fun in spite of its mechanics, not because of them. They were clunky and cumbersome, even in the early &#39;90s.<br /><br />One thing I&#39;ve noticed doing this is that Earthdawn players brought their own brand of narrative authority to the crunch of the official game. On more than one occasion, someone has asked &quot;why doesn&#39;t your hack of [discipline] include [signature move X]?&quot; and then, when you look up X, it is literally nothing but &quot;add a step to some skill&quot;, but has a name that gave the player some notion of it being &quot;signature&quot; to that discipline, and meaning something particular in the fiction. They were already playing Dungeon World, really, just without any help from the rules.</p>

        <p>Lester, if you come see us at a convention, you can get the entire set of the Pathfinder or Savage Worlds books for half off.</p>

        <p>is it possible that you could save the source files in a lower format? I do not have a new enough version of Indesign to even be able to open them!!!<br /></p>
