Can someone help me understand how to use the Paladin move &#39;I am the law&#39; <br />Why is it be 7+?<br />Why does the NPC choose their own reaction?<br />Is it not really a combat driven move?

        <p>Remember that the 10+ is an &quot;also&quot; effect. 7+ is an effect, but 10+ grants that plus a bonus when acting against them.<br /><br />I suspect the NPC chooses one because the move acts somewhat like an interrupt.  If they were about to attack you, and you invoke the move, it gives them pause. The GM considers how the NPC would react and chooses appropriately.<br /><br />It&#39;s not a combat-specific move, as it could be used to direct an NPC while out of combat. But it could certainly be used in combat.</p>

        <p>As <span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink" href="https://plus.google.com/107323876295285638890" oid="107323876295285638890">Benjamin Kramer</a></span> said, some moves are worded &quot;on a 7+, (something), and on a 10+, (something additional)&quot;. It&#39;s a way to give an additional effect on a 10+ without having to write out the whole 7-9 effect again.<br /><br />As for why the NPC gets to choose their reaction? The move is not mind control, and the NPC is still in control of their own actions.<br /><br />Lastly, if the Paladin uses this move in combat, then it&#39;s a combat move. If they use it out of combat, then it&#39;s a non-combat move.</p>
