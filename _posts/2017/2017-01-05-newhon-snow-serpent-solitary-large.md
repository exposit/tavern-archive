<br />Newhon Snow Serpent	(Solitary, Large)<br />Bite (d10 damage)	16 HP	(2 armor)<br /><br />A furred snow serpent is an immense snake covered in thick white fur. They range in length from 60 to 80 feet long, with a head sad to be “as big as an elk” or a horse. At one snow serpent skin was said to be as long as a ship’s mast was tall. They are hot blooded, mammals not reptiles. Snow serpents dwell in the frozen wastes of Nehwon. They also can be found on the higher altitudes of snow and ice-covered mountains peaks. There they feed on various specious of mountain goat and antelope (as well as any luckless travelers who happen to fall into their clutches).Snow serpents are ambush predators, counting on their coloration to render them effectively invisible amid the snow and ice of their home. They will often coil up into depressions or under overhangs, and then strike at any unwary prey that wanders into their range.Afterwards, the snow serpent will find some place secluded to sleep off and digest its meal. As prey is scarce in the mountains and icy wastes, snow snakes will try and take any likely prey item they encounter.<br /><br />Instinct: Consume prey
