<b>Royalty Free Assets for Content Creators</b><br /><br />The Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York has released over 375,000 images. A lot of them are high quality pics of old objects and artifacts, great for making Magic Items and use in Adventures. Would look great in some PDFs for people who make Adventure Fronts and other content.<br /><br /><a href="https://qz.com/904889/how-to-access-375000-beautiful-copyright-free-images-from-new-yorks-metropolitan-museum-of-art/" class="ot-anchor">https://qz.com/904889/how-to-access-375000-beautiful-copyright-free-images-from-new-yorks-metropolitan-museum-of-art/</a>
