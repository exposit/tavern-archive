Over the last year this community was a ton of help while I was trying to get the first group I was GMing for off the ground.  The one thing from our game that I think may be worth sharing is this compendium class for a Dragonkin metamorphoses.  The pdf is still geared toward the quest they were on and how I implemented it but feel free to steal liberally if any of it works for you.  The idea was to slowly give the player more power but at the cost of any interaction with npcs due to their appearance.  Only got to play test it half way through unfortunately but up to that point it wasn&#39;t game breaking at all.  The final step was meant to be a compendium for the retirement move for its character by allowing them to transforming fully into a dragon and then chose a dragon rider character at lvl.1.  The full dragon class had its own moves and basically became a difficult familiar to the dragon rider.  I know this may be a bit much for most peoples ongoing games (as it turned out to be with mine since we didn&#39;t get there) but if anyone were to use this compendium and get a character to the final stages I would be stoked.  Enjoy and thanks to all for the great advice and resources.
