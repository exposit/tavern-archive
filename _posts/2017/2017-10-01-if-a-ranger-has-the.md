If a Ranger has the Elf racial move, and they take Follow Me as an advanced move, do they both stack? Meaning, does the Ranger get an auto 10+ on both roles they choose for Undertake A Perilous Journey?

        <p>Hey Joe,<br /><br />pg 132 in the side bar, it says &quot;If you are an elf travelling through wilderness you automatically succeed at both rolls, as per your racial move.&quot;<br /><br />So you got it! If you are looking at the rules on the SRD, it may be missing the side part notations, which has some great tips for things like this.</p>
