I made this creature using the Mutant and Monstrosity Generator from <span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink" href="https://plus.google.com/117938653641565340771" oid="117938653641565340771">Logan Howard</a></span>&#39;s latest Sword Breaker zine: The Folded Lands. Although this is very tongue-in-cheek, I&#39;ve used the generator to make a few really cool, very usable creatures!<br /><br /><b>The Hunter</b>		<i>Solitary</i><br />8 HP, 0 Armor - Kick (1d10 damage, <i>Forceful</i>, <i>Close</i>)<br /><b>Special Quality:</b> Natural Camouflage<br /><br />The Hunter is a large spell-casting, nearly invisible turkey that preys upon humans one day out of every year. The Hunter will blend into its environment with a natural camouflage and wait until just the right moment to attack with fire spells to debilitate its prey, then move in for the kill with a swift kick. After eating some of the victim it will then cast a freezing spell to save the meat, eating the leftovers of several kills throughout the rest of the year.<br /><br /><i>Instinct</i>: To wait patiently for prey<br />     Leap out of harmâ€™s way<br />     Blend into the background<br />     Cast elemental spells<br /><br /><br />

        <p>I love it. I imagine it as an avatar of all the combined hate/resentment that turkeys feel. And I think it looks like a hybrid turkey-axebeak. :) And it casts spells by doing a fancy, ritualistic, mesmerizing dance (like a bird&#39;s courtship dance).</p>

        <p>Yay! Thanks for that Brian! I think I know which options got that result too. What a fun interpretation!</p>

        <p>I highly recommend this issue to anyone who hasn&#39;t already gotten it. As soon as I&#39;m done play testing the next issue of my own zine I&#39;m going to start a campaign in The Folded Lands. There&#39;s some really cool stuff going on there!</p>

A while back, there were a bunch of wild turkeys in our yard and they started doing some pretty amazing dances.</p>
