I haven&#39;t posted here in AAAGES but I had to share my excitement. My home group has taken a few months off and one player is on indeterminate hiatus, but the rest of us are getting together for session 17 (OMG). Anyway, that&#39;s 5 weeks away so I devised a travel montage with 5 scenes, and each week I present the scene in chat for a single character to use as their spotlight. They describe the challenge they face, then Defy Danger with custom outcomes of debility or debility and gear loss. A single roll will determine their disposition at the journey&#39;s end, based on what may have debilitated them during the scene. I might post screenshots of my favourite bits later but the first scene is a corker! <a rel="nofollow" class="ot-hashtag" href="https://plus.google.com/s/%23Engagement/posts">#Engagement</a>

        <p>Hehe, cool! I&#39;m applying your idea to my current game which is taking a few weeks break. We left last session on a cliff hanger with most of the party hiding in a small tunnel below a dragon&#39;s hoard. The barbarian (currently invisible) is standing right in the middle of the chamber as the irate dragon enters. I&#39;m going to put together a little montage of descriptions and rolls to see how they are preparing for what seems like the inevitable confrontation with the dragon... Looking forward to your highlights reel! L<br /></p>
