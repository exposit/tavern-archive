About to play my first DW game, and considering a gnome wizard. That is, the standard Wizard but using racial options for a gnome.  I feel like I saw some a while back, and that DW gnomes are size Tiny instead of Small (?), but I don&#39;t know where.  Any help?

        <p>Gnomes can be whatever size you want in your Dungeon World. <br /><br />There is no canon gnome. There is no canon anything really.</p>

        <p>I would talk to your GM.  One thing you will notice is that each of the classes have different racial benefits for the same race.  So be prepared to answer: What makes a Gnome Wizard different from a Human or Eleven or other wizard?  What are they good at.  Size does not have much of a crunchy game effect in DW.  It is the roleplaying that you need to think in terms of.  In any event you and your GM can customize things for lots of fun and make what you both want.  Also, if your GM is doing things right then the players come up with much of the content of the game as the GM does.  Don&#39;t think in game terms first.  Think in roleplaying terms and then build the moves from there.  Ultimately, DW is meant for the GM and the Players to come up with 1/2 of the rules and all of the background together.  It is a system that harkens back to pure narrative and pure roleplaying and the simple system makes it so you can have anything and so that roleplaying (Fiction First) is what is first considered before the rules come into play.<br /></p>

        <p>Fighter: Gnomish warriors are masters of camouflage. When you have time and have the right materials, conceal yourself and take +1 forward.<br /><br />Ranger: Your people have domesticated those beasts who make their lives underground. You can take a dog sized mole or badger as an animal companion, which has burrow as a free training. <br /><br />Druid: The depths of the earth is always considered your land, in addition to any others. <br /><br />Bard:  Add the following effect to the list of things you can do with Arcane Art: perform minor acts of illusion, as the wizard spell Prestidigitation<br /><br />Wizard: Take +1 ongoing to any attempt to cast an illusion spell.</p>

        <p>You could take the illusionist trope for gnomes and follow the elven racial move:<br /><br />&quot;You come from a people of illusion. Invisibility is a cantrip for you.&quot;<br /><br />Another way to take it would be:<br /><br />&quot;Your people are masters of illusion. The illusions you create with Prestidigitation are masterwork and will fool creatures into believing they are real, at least for a time.&quot;</p>

        <p>My Archmage class, while utilizing my own magic resource system, has a gnome racial option. Their racial ability basically translates out to they prepare spells per day equal to their level +2 instead of level +1, because they take more to magical classes than physical ones because of their small size. You could also make it where any illusion spells you prepare are treated as being one level lower. That&#39;s a bigger benefit, but more specific to classic views of gnomes in D&amp;D type games.</p>
