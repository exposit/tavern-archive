I need some help with some custom moves.<br /><br />This first one is for a Fey. Originally I was just going to use to use &quot;Grant a wish, with a twist&quot; as a monster move but I was wondering if you guys could help me come up with a custom to replace it. Maybe something like<br /><br />When you ask a Fey to grant a wish, Roll+Cha. On a 10+, your wish is granted. On a 7-9, you wish is granted but with an unforseen twist. <br /><br />Second one is for traveling through a forest where Fey trick travelers. <br /><br />When you travel through Fey infested forests, roll+Int. On a 10+, you find it with little issue. On a 7-9, choose 1<br />-You finally made but the journey left exhausted. Take -1 ongoing until you make camp<br />- The Fey led you into the path of a hostile creature or into an environmental hazard.<br /><br />Another one I was work on was a custom move for a Dryad. This is what I have currently but it seems uninteresting.<br /><br /> When you look upon a Dryad’s beauty, roll+Wis. On a 10+, you steel yourself and manage not to fall in love with her. On a 7-9, you manage you resist her partially but you&#39;re still bedazzled. Take -1 ongoing as long as you&#39;re in her presence<br /><br />Any ideas on how I can improve these?

        <p>Granting a wish is pretty big I&#39;d assume.  These Fey aren&#39;t easy to find are they?<br /><br />I&#39;d maybe use the Parley move</p>

Since a wish is potentially so powerful, It might be better to keep as a monster move so the wish always had a downside as a way of balancing out.</p>

        <p><b>When you ask a Fey to grant a wish,</b> Roll+Cha. On a 7+, your wish is granted, but with an unforeseen twist. On a 10+, the twist is avoidable if you&#39;re smart or lucky enough.</p>

        <p>I&#39;m not a big fan of the roll for the wish. What happens on a failure? Plus, isn&#39;t the fae &quot;granting a wish&quot; and not &quot;a 70% chance of granting you wish if you talk nice?<br /><br />A while back, for my <i>deck of many things</i> alike for DW, I wrote a more generic &quot;grant a wish&quot; move. It may be too D&amp;D-like for your purposes, but might be of use to you. One thing that it does is stipulate that the more litigious and pedantic the request is, the less likely the deck will give you what you actually want.<br /><br /><a href="http://rpg.divnull.com/wiki/index.php/Whispering_Deck#Granted_a_Boon" class="ot-anchor">http://rpg.divnull.com/wiki/index.php/Whispering_Deck#Granted_a_Boon</a></p>

The Monkey&#39;s Paw short story was what I was attempting to draw inspiration from for this move.</p>

        <p>If you are going for a Monkey Paw. Maybe only a 12+ gives you EXACTLY what you want.</p>

I&#39;m not sure how to distinguish the 7-9 and 10+ results though. <br /><br />When you ask a Fey to grant a wish, roll+Cha. On a 12+, your wish is granted exactly as you envisioned it. On a hit, your wish is granted but with an unforseen twist.</p>

        <p>On a 10+, you could give the player/character some hint about what that twist will be. Or allow them to ask a question about it.</p>

        <p>Could use &quot;ranges&quot; of effect.<br /><br />For example:<br />10-11 you get your wish, but something imidiate and minor goes wrong.<br />7-9 youre wish is granted, but unwanted events will come to pass.<br />6- the Fey do not find you worthy and decide to use your life in their games. You won&#39;t like what happens next.</p>
