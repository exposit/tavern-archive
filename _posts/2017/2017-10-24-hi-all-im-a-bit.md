Hi all, I&#39;m a bit of a noob at dungeon world and have only played one session. I have a question:<br />When do the players consume rations?<br />Thanks!

        <p>Whenever they eat. At least once a day to stay healthy, twice at least if they want to stay in good condition for adventuring. Typically when a party isn&#39;t actually off in a dungeon, it&#39;s best to have them eat proper food, at an inn or tavern. Dungeon rations should only be eaten while in a dungeon or food is otherwise unattainable.</p>

        <p>The Make Camp move requires that you consume a ration. I don&#39;t think it says what happens if you don&#39;t have any though.<br />Rations can also be good leverage to parlay with some monsters, and as a GM they&#39;re a great target for a hard move: food can get spoiled, stolen, poisoned, infested with face eater worms...</p>

        <p>Consuming a ration is a condition of the Make Camp move. No ration to consume then you&#39;re not really making the Make Camp move so you don&#39;t get the benefits of it</p>
