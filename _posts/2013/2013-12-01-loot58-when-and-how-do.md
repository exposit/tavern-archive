Loot: When and how do you implement it into your games? Often I&#39;ve found that my players aren&#39;t very much interested in it, but as a player I find it to be very rewarding. <br /><br />Thoughts?

        <p>Oh i like looting enemies and then rolling on the loot table. If you like this kind of stuff you should bring it up in the first session. </p>

        <p>My son GMd his first game last night. Everytime we killed something there was a shower of loot. Then I realized he had watched Scott Pilgrim a few times too many...</p>

        <p>Considering a good event may cost a player resources, even finding a few coins after an encounter is important.<br /><br />Player rolls 7 while stabbing with a knife, the &quot;monster&quot; can take the slash but smack their knife away. Turn it into a 6 and much worse can happen from that.</p>

        <p>When I remember to do so (or my players have time/inclination to loot the bodies and remind me) I roll the biggest damage dice out of whatever they just fought and give them either something relevant to their current adventure, or greater or lesser usefulness depending on the roll, or a coin equivalent.<br /><br />Really good loot tends to come out of the fiction, so I don&#39;t push it. (The druid helped out the frog tribes of the Bufo-bufo, and they craft an aurochs-horn staff for him in his honour.) But I probably should push it more, because it&#39;s one of the key questions at the end.</p>

If they don&#39;t look to loot, they won&#39;t get anything, but if you&#39;re following the gm moves, taking their resources should be high on the list. Making them look more for things to replace that.<br /><br />One session, player lost primary weapon twice, first knocked out of reach and last shattering it trying to hold open a magic door. (Maces - not the best door stoppers)</p>

        <p>I dunno, the older I get the less I want bag junk.. The intangibles get better and better.  Like the undying support of the gate guards.</p>

        <p>I think the game won&#39;t break if you roll treasure for every monster you kill, and then just kind of hide some of it away for the PCs to find later if the monster was not of the sort inclined to carry anything. <br /><br />They&#39;ve got to actually carry all that money around and there&#39;s not a lot to buy without obvious downsides except for:<br /><br />Bandages (easy fix: bandages only work once. Once you bandage your wounds you have to get hurt again before you can bandage more.)<br /><br />Healing Potions (healing potions are never in common supply, always roll Supply)<br /><br />Generally I let a single Supply roll get people 200 coin in healing potions or 100-200 coin consumable items (I have a deck of random potion effects from Toolcards, it works great) or a single 300-700 coin magic item.<br /><br />When my players buy or find a magic item, I always ask: what can this item do that&#39;s worth losing it forever?</p>

But looting also gives those wonderful plot hook moments. Best example I can think of is the doll in the comic Goblins. It was what dropped when the girl was hurt. It lead to a story arch.<br /><br />It doesn&#39;t have to be important, but sometimes the fiction of how the item dropped is what&#39;s important</p>
