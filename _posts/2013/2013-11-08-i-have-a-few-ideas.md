I have a few ideas I want to try out for a project I&#39;m working on, and I need a pair of willing experimental subjects! My free time is during my day, so:<br /><br />What I need: 2-3 players<br />When I need them: Monday, 11 November, 1630-1900 UTC (1130-1400 EST)<br />What you need: No Dungeon World experience is necessary, but I am trying to evoke the specific feel of Fritz Leiber&#39;s fantasy, so familiarity with the subgenre is a plus.

        <p>Thank you gentlemen! If you&#39;d be so kind as to make sure I&#39;m in one of your circles, more information will be forthcoming over the weekend.</p>
