Worlds in Peril -  Supers hack for DW/AW<br /><br />Due to some of the difference in emulating the genre I&#39;ve changed a lot of things up. If anyone is interested, I&#39;d love to get some more experienced eyes on it and to hear what you think. I hope to playtest it soon as well so we&#39;ll see how much survives gameplay.<br /><br />I ended up changing stats to verbs, using Paul T&#39;s harm moves, and messed with damage a bit. Using some moves from AW/ DW, making up a list of +1 Traits to check off each session for encouraging certain behaviors and traits players take, XP traits they can check off for XP (based off milestones in MHR). Added countdowns for grim portents. <br /><br />The moves are something I&#39;ll have to keep working on and will have a better grasp of once we play and work out balance with damage and the like.
