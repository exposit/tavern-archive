This Sunday, we will play our second Microscope session, and our &quot;points of light&quot; inspired setting will then begin come new year.<br /><br />I&#39;m so excited! Currently, I &quot;persuading&quot; the other players that the game will be far more interesting if I&#39;m mean when making hard moves.<br /><br />So far they&#39;re taking the bait. Especially one of them, who usually doesn&#39;t like that kind of &quot;consequence play&quot; as he calls it. He consider it a kind of &quot;gotcha&quot; type play.<br /><br />He was easily convinced, when I said that <i>earning</i> your loot (and continued existence) was much more satisfying than the adventure being a &quot;cake walk&quot;.<br /><br />I can&#39;t wait to finally getting started on this game. An actual campaign. :)

        <p>You only go &quot;gotcha&quot; when they give you a golden opportunity. Otherwise it is just the result of a failed roll, there is no gotcha moment ere.</p>

        <p>This. So much this. Players don&#39;t realize how much more fun the game is when they earn it.</p>

        <p>The only time I am aggravated with a challenge is when I am hoping for a light relaxed tone, DW presents some tension on failure &amp; hard moves, but that is a feature in sword &amp; sorcery style fantasy.   I think you have done the right thing in letting them know.  If your beloved hometown goes down in flames that can be jarring if you are expecting a slice of life game, but completely in tone for high adventure.</p>
