You know, you can reskin the Inverse World&#39;s Captain playbook to play a dragon-rider very easily. Playing a dragon may not be much harder. I should write that up.

        <p>The difference is that a dragon has a mind of its own, an airship is just a thing. That&#39;s a huge difference. If you don&#39;t think of a Tremaire like scenario then the other players lack stuff to do in the <del>airship</del> dragon. There are a lot of problems you need to think about.</p>

        <p>An airship also has a crew.<br /><br />If you really want to have it as a dragon, just integrate it into your ship. The crew needs to feed the dragon coal mid flight, have to ensure it&#39;s under control. Airship malfunctions can be replaced by random acts of Dragon.</p>

        <p>I would totally give my Airship the &quot;Intelligent&quot; tag.</p>
