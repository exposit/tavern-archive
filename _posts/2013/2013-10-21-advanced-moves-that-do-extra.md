Advanced Moves that do extra damage, like Smite or Merciless...these apply to dealing damage via the Defend move as well, correct?

        <p>&quot;When you deal damage...&quot;<br /><br />I can only assume it does :-)</p>

        <p>Defending, Hacking and Slashing, Volley. Stabbing someone in the butt when they&#39;re not looking, dropping a bag of hammers from a sixth-story window, suplexing them through a plate glass window.  Whatever you&#39;ve got.</p>

        <p>For a high level character with the right advanced moves, do you do more average damage when defending than during H&amp;S?</p>

        <p>You&#39;d need to be above [0.5 class damage] for that.  So a level 6 Paladin.  And this ain&#39;t DnD 4 or anything; &quot;average&quot; isn&#39;t as big of a deal when nothing has 100+ HP.</p>

        <p>Does this become a problem? I mean, does Defending become tactically superior to H&amp;S at some point, so players will just constantly Defend?</p>

        <p>I don&#39;t think it is a <i>problem</i> because when you <i>defend</i>, then you usually do that in lieu of something else.<br /><br />A Wizard that doesn&#39;t cast spells isn&#39;t a very fictionally efficient Wizard, and the wizard is the only one to have a d4 for damage.<br /><br />The Cleric follows the same logic, Bards can&#39;t defend themselves and boost his allies at the same time, and the Druid either defends or spends his hold. Either way, all classes that has a d6 or worse can usually do <i>better</i> than deal [level] damage.<br /><br />That&#39;s how I see it at least.</p>

        <p>well a singing bard might be able to defend and sing at the same time. <br /> <a rel="nofollow" class="ot-hashtag" href="https://plus.google.com/s/%23bardweek/posts">#bardweek</a>  </p>

Don&#39;t punish them for using the abilities that make their characters cool :)<br /><br />EDIT: Made a &quot;there they&#39;re their&quot; mistake!</p>
