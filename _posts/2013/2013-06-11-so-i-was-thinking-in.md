So I was thinking in less fighty games do you call for defy danger Cha or int or wis for social settings. I am thinking like you have a elf noble who is distrustful of you giving you the third degree when you crash the elf party of of some elfy dudes and chicks dancing and some stuff. You don&#39;t have leverage so there is no parley perse. I was thinking of ways to bring more moves into the game. I think if the player is fast talking his way into why his group of murder hobos fit right in this shindig that would be a defy danger either int or Cha depending on whether he is fast talking or charming him up on how nice his cravat is. <br /><br />How do others handle social situations and debates without leverage? I like BW social confirmation mechanic but BW has always been beyond my kin while DW is right there in the sweet spot. <br /><br />So how do you handle social confrentations or encounters where leverage is not at hand but you don&#39;t want to play lets pretend and have a conversation. I was thinking a lot of spout lore, discern realties (which might get you some leverage) and defy danger (with the latter on a 10+ might give you some leverage). Or do I need a custom move. I think the wifey might want more talkin&#39; and less fightin&#39; in the current family game. She seemed to like char gen more than fighting the dragon. <br /><br />Also cogutating on my shadows of the spider moon hack I am working on. <br />As always thanks in advance for the active community and help. <br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" class="ot-hashtag" href="https://plus.google.com/s/%23spelljammer/posts">#spelljammer</a>

        <p>Parley is when you want something and you have leverage to get it. Defy Danger with CHA is when they have something and you really, really don&#39;t want it :p</p>
