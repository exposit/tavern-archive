Shining Moments from today&#39;s session:<br />Dinosaur mating call attracting some tyrannosauri.<br />Turning back time to undue the Druid&#39;s certain death.<br />The lesser diety of cheese; Lactose.<br /><br />I will say that GMing DungeonWorld is very exhausting. After 4 hours I don&#39;t think I could handle any more. Truly a mental workout.<br /><br />A takeaway that I&#39;ve been meaning to talk about:<br />Don&#39;t plan anything. Ask a player &quot;What about this world is so fantastically different from our own?&quot; and follow it up with a question to give direction to where the adventure starts.<br /><br />Whew, I need a nap.

        <p>Impressive improvisation, <span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink" href="https://plus.google.com/102405164977052627173" oid="102405164977052627173">Pete French</a></span>! Thanks for a great game. I really liked building the world through answering the questions you asked. And I liked how the various elements then played off each other organically. Lactose, the lesser god of Cheese, would have been a ridiculous element to insert into another game...but oddly enough his cheesy magnificence actually made sense today :)</p>

        <p>I think it was everyone else&#39;s creativity that was great. I tried to do my best to avoid creating any lore myself. All i did was motivate and make moves. It is way more rewarding as a GM to spur players into creativity than to bore them with your own machinations.</p>
