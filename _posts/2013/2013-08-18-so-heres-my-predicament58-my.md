So, here&#39;s my predicament:<br /><br />My Artificer wants to chop off his own leg a replace it with a mechanical/magical one. The twist is that he wants to teach the Templar to amputate it for him. Should I write a custom move? Should just use Defy Danger, maybe on both of their parts? <br /><br />I left the session on a cliffhanger as the two go off to find a spot to amputate and I&#39;m in need of some guidance.

        <p>Honestly, I&#39;d recommend just letting them do it. No rolls, just let the fiction dictate it.  Make a custom move for your Artificer for his new leg. Add &quot;messy&quot; as a tag for any bladed weapon your Templar wields. Toss in fiction during battle how he now slices the limbs off his enemies, etc. I would let the players have what they want as long as it adds to the fiction.</p>

        <p>+1ing this. Treat the mechanical leg as a new element to draw on when you make a move. &quot;Rolled a 7, huh ? Well you can escape the ogre. But only if you leave your leg behind.&quot;</p>

        <p>Surgically amputating someone&#39;s limb on an operating table doesn&#39;t have very much in common with de-limbing enemies in combat, so I don&#39;t see how that justifies handing the Templar a free Messy tag on all their attacks.<br /><br />But yes - just let it happen, no rolls involved. If the Artificer just wants the leg to be mechanical then that&#39;s fine, there&#39;s no need for anything else, it&#39;s just another fictional element for you to draw on like Eric pointed out. If it&#39;s going to have special properties or a custom move, make him pay money for it or take the move at next level up, respectively.</p>

        <p>For the amputation, I&#39;d go with a slighly more precise Defy Danger, something like &quot;roll +(whatever makes sense, I&#39;d say DEX or WIS). 10+ You do it clean and fast, 7-9 you choose : either you do it but your <del>victim</del> patient take a hard move (possibly damage) or you don&#39;t go through. 6- the patient takes a hard move and you don&#39;t go through.&quot; </p>

        <p>Amputating the leg of a willing subject: not that hard, right? The results of the leg grafting process strikes me as way more interesting.</p>

        <p>My first instinct was to just let it happen. However, these are not exactly the best conditions for an amputation. They&#39;re going out to the woods to find a &quot;safe place&quot; and the artificer procured a root that, when ground up into a paste, has numbing properties. On top of it all, the Templar is not exactly a trained surgeon, so all of these circumstances combined makes me feel like something could go horribly wrong.</p>

        <p>Well, make a move that follows. Identify what you see as plausible dangers, and ask questions! &quot;What are you looking for, when you say &#39;safe place&#39;? Okay, how much of this numbing paste are you using? You still have to be able to perform the grafting procedure, right? Templar, you ready for this? Are you sure? I mean, your last brother-in-arms who lost a leg, how long did it take him to bleed out and die? That&#39;s serious shit, right here.&quot;</p>
