Would you happen to have a good move when your party flee/pursue some monsters?<br /><br />It&#39;s the kind of things that can happen in a dungeon.

        <p>Probably Defy Danger, with the appropriate stat being related to how they are fleeing or pursuing. All out sprint? STR. Darting around obstacles? DEX. A long, grueling chase? CON.</p>

        <p>Or perilous journey. Depending on the head start. You block off the cave as you make your escape there&#39;s the belief you might be able to take a small rest</p>

        <p>You could make a specific move for a specific dungeon:<br /><br />When you throw caution to the wind and run like hells out of the Sleeping Queen&#39;s Tomb, roll + Wis:<br /><br />On a 10+ you get the hell out of there, though whatever you woke up might be following you.<br /><br />On a 7-9, you get right to one of the exits and something bars your way.<br /><br />On a miss, you make a mistake and go deeper into the tomb and you can hear the queen&#39;s hearts beating; she is awake.<br /><br />When you throw caution tot he wind and run like hells out of the Iron Liche&#39;s Tomb, roll + Wis:<br /><br />On a 10+ you get the hell out of there, though however you got in will be more difficult to traverse next time.<br /><br />On a 7-9, you get out by the klaxons are sounding and the steam ghouls are roused to hunt you down.<br /><br />On a miss, you are lost in the factory-tomb and the red-goggled eye of the Iron Liche is upon you.</p>

        <p>I think I&#39;ve come up with something a bit more generic than a dungeon move. To be used when your PCs decide to leg it and fight another day:<br /><br />When you flee from peril, roll 2D6+Str.<br />10+: You distance yourself from the said peril<br />7-9: You distance yourself but the GM chooses one:<br />- It costs you something<br />- The peril/opposition increases<br />- A new peril/obstacle arises</p>
