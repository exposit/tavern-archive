I&#39;ve been working on a Dungeon World hack set in a magical university and, as warm up for it, wrote out a new class. I&#39;d love some feedback on my in progress Illusionist, if anyone could give it a look.

        <p>Cursorily, there are some things I definitely like in here (like Well Traveled and Elaborate Illusion), but what I look for in classes is some real flavor that differentiates them from what&#39;s already available. What I&#39;m getting from the Illusionist is pretty much a Wizard with a different spell list. (I also personally am not a huge fan of spell lists.) <br /><br />Maybe there&#39;s a way to just come up with a &quot;POOF! You make an illusion!&quot; move? Tied into or expanded from Elaborate Illusion? It&#39;ll give greater versatility to the Illusionist than a spell list might, and I think it&#39;d be fun to also play up the performer side of things, although I guess that might similarly be verging on Bard territory. </p>

        <p>Yeah. I&#39;m trying to chart a path between the Bard and Wizard. It isn&#39;t a super wide one, I&#39;m finding. Elaborate Illusion is probably the part that could use the most polish. Getting it instead of Ritual is the big difference between Illusionist and Wizard, and Elaborate Illusion isn&#39;t really there yet.</p>

        <p>Maybe instead of Elaborate Illusion, something like Things are Not as They Seem: when you have a hour to meditate and prepare with you spell book, roll + Int: On a 10+ hold 3. On a 7-9, hold 1. On a miss, hold 1 anyway, but things will go wrong when you use it. Spend hold at any time to reveal that some aspect of the situation present when you prepared this effect is not as it seems. Negate or alter the effects of events to take this into account.</p>
