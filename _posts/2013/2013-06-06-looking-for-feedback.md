Looking for feedback.<br /><br />I&#39;m running  a new (read: first ever) DW adventure soon and wanted to include some custom moves.  The first leg of the journey is across a treacherous sea wherein the adventurers encounter more than one danger.  Since most of this session will take place on a ship I thought it right to add some ship related moves.  Below is an original move I made for the game plus a modified move from the DW Guide.<br /><br />1. Knife Slide Down A Sail<br />&quot;When you stab in to the sail and ride the tear to the deck like a grinning scoundrel, roll +Dex.&quot;<br />On a 10+<br /> - You land safely.  Add  +1 hold if you flourish.<br /> On a 7 - 9<br /> - You land, but amongst a cacophany of battle<br />On a miss,<br /> - You stop short in the sail.  Loose the knife to catch a rope(+Dex) or drop to the deck for1d4 damage.<br /><br />2. Swinging of the Rigging<br />&quot;When you swing on the rigging toward some scurvy bastard with a cutlass in your teeth, roll +Dex. <br />On a 10+<br /> - you knock them over and gain 1 hold.<br />On a 7-9<br /> - you are both knocked over and fall in to a tangled pile.<br />On a miss<br /> - you or your weapon is flung overboard.<br /><br />Would love some pointers as I&#39;m still learning the ropes (pun intended?) of Dungeon World.

        <p>hey, maybe I&#39;m missing the obvious, but: what do you spend those holds on?<br /><br />Also, how can you be so sure that the game will entirely take place on a boat?</p>

        <p>hmm, well I understand holds to be additions to the players next move.  The point was to give them an opportunity to get the jump on an enemy or situation. <br /><br />And the boat is just a part-time leg of the adventure. The game fiction will put them right on it and I have a few dangers I&#39;ll throw at them. I just wanted to give them the opportunity to be piratical with these moves.</p>

        <p>The Dungeon World Beginner&#39;s guide has a good section on how to write moves and a &quot;swinging from the rigging&quot; move in it and a discussion on what makes a good move. Check it out here:  <a href="http://www.mediafire.com/view/?ypk10uede2sgri6" class="ot-anchor">http://www.mediafire.com/view/?ypk10uede2sgri6</a><br /><br /><br />I can&#39;t recommend it enough!</p>

The rigging swing  move I did here is a modified version from the Guide.  I wanted to remake it to better understand how to design moves.  A trial by fire as it were.</p>

        <p>holds are move-specific resources spent within the move that generated them. See Defend for an example. What you are looking for is &quot;take +1 forward to do X&quot;, which means &quot;take +1 to your next roll to do X&quot;.<br /><br />I asked about the boat just because I don&#39;t understand how can you be so prepared in a first ever session!</p>

        <p>Yeah no offense man but doesn&#39;t it say in the book not to plan your first session?</p>

        <p>The book does not say &quot;no planning&quot; - just don&#39;t bring a planned story or plot.</p>

        <p>Exactly so! Don&#39;t plan a story or plot. Which is exactly what seems to be happening here.<br /><br />&quot;The first leg of the journey is across a treacherous sea wherein the adventurer a encounter more than one danger.&quot; Sounds like plot to me.</p>

        <p>&quot;If you like you can plan a little more. Maybe think of an evil plot and who’s behind it, or some monsters you’d like to use.&quot; Plot, right there is the rule book...ToMAYto...ToMAHto.. :)</p>

I&#39;m still working out the kinks with the terminology definitions.  Perhaps a better form of this instance, for example, could be &quot;take +1 to your next attack roll, or Hack&amp;Slash.&quot; Maybe I&#39;ll invent swashbuckling.</p>

        <p>@ everyone still, how does the balance look for the Move building on either?</p>
