Dungeon World beautifully captures a classic, high-adventure DnD aesthetic and leaves the calculus behind. Adam Koebel was generous enough to sit down with u...

        <p>Good interview!  I understand what you meant about &quot;If you have a game you&#39;ve been working on since the mid-90&#39;s, toss it out&quot;.  A lot has changed in &quot;state-of-the-art&quot; game design since then, and ideas that you once thought were cool and innovative are probably old now.  But I think if you remain up to date in reading and playing new games, you can find ways to merge new ideas (like from DW or Fate) with some of your own concepts and thus revitalize your ideas.  (Can you tell I&#39;ve been working on a game since the &#39;90&#39;s myself?  LOL.  But it has changed a great deal since the 1st versions long ago, it now uses a version of Fate as the base and builds from there)</p>

What&#39;s stopping you from publishing it, you know?  Is it because it needs more playtesting?  Playtest it!  Does it need more writing?  Why?  Do you need money?  Publish it as a PDF and Print-on-Demand product instead!<br /><br />Perfect is the enemy of done, and all that.</p>

        <p>Perfect sure is the enemy of done!  For a while it was finding a core resolution system that I really liked (It shifted between 3 main ones and numerous minor variations on them: a 2d10 system, a small d6 pool that never went above 5 dice, and a system that used a standard deck of playing cards.)  There were also several attempts to really make characters unique and have that matter in the game, which I never fully solved until I read SotC and discovered Aspects.  So I scrapped most of what I wrote and adapted the rest to Fate.  I released a small free version of that and it got great responses, so I set to work on taking more of my ideas (including using the deck of playing cards instead of fudge dice) and including my setting info, etc.  It&#39;s up to 120 pages now and still growing, at this point it&#39;s filling in details on the outlined parts that remain and fleshing out the setting further.  Not sure if I&#39;ll do a KS or what yet.<br /><br />DW has been very helpful too and the idea of &quot;pick what happens from a short list&quot; has been added to things like steamtech device malfunctions and spell failures, for example.</p>

        <p>I&#39;m pretty good at scrapping projects, but often that is because I find out that someone else did something similar. For example, my Random Dungeon Tiles, if anyone ever laid eyes on my blog. Someone posted a comment about Dungeon Morphs, and then it was just a redundant idea.<br /><br />Then I wanted to make an AW hack for a two-player horror game. <span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink" href="https://plus.google.com/118131565520525592332" oid="118131565520525592332">Vincent Baker</a></span> already did that, I was told, so I didn&#39;t bother working on it further.<br /><br />I&#39;ve learned to appreciate this, instead of being let down. I wanted to make these things so I could <i>use</i> it, not to earn money or anything else, after all. :) </p>

I was pleasantly surprised by the hosts as well, I&#39;ll have to look up some more of their stuff.</p>
