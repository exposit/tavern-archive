I&#39;m very new to Dungeon World but having a blast so far playing it. What I&#39;m coming to you all for is help in picking or perhaps designing a class for my character. We&#39;re playing in an unusual pseudo-modern homegrown setting and none of the default book classes work well for my concept. I&#39;d love to find a third party class that fits well, or pointing to good resources for designing one&#39;s own class.<br /><br />Here&#39;s the quick overview of the character: He&#39;s a modern-day human surrounded by elf-like non-tech-using culture. He&#39;s an inventor/engineer/technician that scavenges what modern tech is left in this world to create makeshift tools/gadgets/whatever for any situation. I REALLY like the adventurer&#39;s kit mechanic and thought it would be cool to have a core class mechanic that is similar in its &quot;always have the right tool for the situation&quot; feeling.<br /><br />Does anyone know of any classes out there that would at least be a good starting place for designing this class? Thanks!

        <p>Might want to look into Inverse World&#39;s The Collector or Dungeon Planet&#39;s The Earthling.</p>

        <p>Sounds like a wizard but you describe your magic as tech in the fiction.  Ritual is the right tool for the situation if there&#39;s an outlet to plug it into.</p>

        <p>I checked out Dungeon Planet&#39;s Earthling. It certainly fits thematically, but the mechanical effects of the class did not speak to me much other than the Deliberate Expedition move which is precisely what I was looking for more of.<br /><br />The Collector from Inverse World on the other hand looks VERY promising! I was only able to find the first page of the character sheet from the KickStarter page though - is the full version of that class out to backers? I like that this has mechanics that specifically interact with the adventurer&#39;s kit and is really themed around collecting and using <b>stuff</b>.<br /><br />(And since The Technician was mentioned: I originally planned on using this class and reskinning it to our world, but after a couple of sessions of trying that I gave up hence this thread; the technician is REALLY based around sci-fi tech that is a lot more powerful than I wanted my trinkets to be and I was having trouble reskinning them in a fun way)</p>

        <p>The makeshift gadgets sound a lot like the Artificer to me</p>

        <p>I&#39;ll add my vote for the Artificer.  Sounds pretty close to what you are looking for.</p>

        <p>Alright, here&#39;s the result for anyone curious! The Inverse World creator very graciously provided me the full version of The Collector, and I also snagged The Artificer.<br /><br />They are both really great for the concept, but overall The Collector is just too perfect. They both fit the &quot;gadget dude&quot; role, but the Artificer is more about having a few specific gadgets where the Collector is based around having lots of little things in his collection that can be useful in surprising ways.<br /><br />I would have been happy to go with either, but I&#39;ve chosen The Collector. Thank you everyone for the suggestions!</p>
