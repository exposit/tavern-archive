 <a rel="nofollow" class="ot-hashtag" href="https://plus.google.com/s/%23BardWeek/posts">#BardWeek</a>   <br /><br />Dwarfen Instruments <br /><br />Dwarfen instruments are made out of heavy metal alloys and are exhausting to play. Due to their sturdy nature they weight 1 (instead of 0) but can be used as a Close Weapon. <br />Any Bard playing a Dwarfen instrument can use CON instead of CHA for Arcane Arts. <br />Typical dwarfen instruments are <br />Bagpipes, trombones, cornettes, washboards and drums. <br /><br />Dwarfen Bard Racial Move: <br />When you use a Dwarfen Instrument for Arcane Arts and you grant an Ally extra damage, their next attack also gains the forceful tag. <br />(you may start the game with a dwarfen instrument. Tell us what it is and who made it for you)

        <p>It&#39;s way more than &quot;Weight 1&quot; but I see a crazy steam calliope, something like the Dwarven steamroller from &quot;Blood Bowl&quot; -- very forceful, and pretty messy too!</p>
