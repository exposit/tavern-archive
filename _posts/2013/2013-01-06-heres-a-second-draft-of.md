Here&#39;s a second draft of my mentalist class, renamed the Mindweaver. Much thanks to the folks who provided commentary and perspectives that led me to a better realization of just what it is I&#39;m trying to do here.

        <p>Really cool!  <br /><br />Pretty sure that &quot;Mentok&quot; needs to be on the human name list, if only so I can be THIS GUY:<br /><br /><a href="http://murlocparliament.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/mentok1.jpg" class="ot-anchor">http://murlocparliament.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/mentok1.jpg</a></p>

        <p>Nope. I couldn&#39;t pin down a satisfactory sense of which of those &quot;pick one of these&quot; options I thought fit better with which race. So I punted.</p>

        <p>Fair enough.<br /><br />I&#39;m not sure I get how <b>Mindtouch</b> works, though. So I can make a &quot;physical&quot; move at -1 forward, yes? I roll that move as normal, then I make a <i>second</i> move to see if what I pick? Or do I <b>project psychic force</b> first, <i>then</i> roll the other move? That seems to be the intention, given how one of the choices affects the physical move.<br /><br />Does the GM get to make a move between &quot;project psychic force&quot; and the physical move?</p>

        <p>Whoops, I meant to pull the extra-action option! Let me do so now. <i>yoink</i> There, it&#39;s gone. I had something in mind but it takes more work and another class. Now it&#39;s a roll to take a single physical action at a distance, with or without imagined cover.</p>

        <p>A few other things as I scan:<br /><br />I don&#39;t think you&#39;d really need any kind of roll for &quot;Mindspeak&quot;. I&#39;d just say &quot;you can mentally communicate with anyone you can see&quot;, and have a 2-5 advanced move to be able to communicate with them even if you can&#39;t see them. Otherwise it feels like unnecessary complication.<br /><br />Mindblight should say &quot;When you deal damage, the target gets -1 ongoing to damage rolls until it sleeps or you do, whichever comes first. This stacks, but only to a maximum of your INT.&quot; just to bring it in line with normal DW terminology. Also, I don&#39;t get what you mean by describing it as a debility.<br /><br />Mindbond looks pretty powerful for a 2-5 move; maybe make it a 6-10?<br /><br />Mindcloud and Unseen Adversary seem kinda redundant.</p>

        <p>Hmm! Good thoughts. I will ponder.</p>
