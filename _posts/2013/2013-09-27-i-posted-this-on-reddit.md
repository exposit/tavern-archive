I posted this on Reddit, but I thought it might get more discussion here:<br /><br /><b>&quot;Stun Damage&quot; and &quot;Debility: Stunned&quot;—connection or coincidence?</b><br /><br />The text of the &quot;Stun Damage&quot; section says anyone &quot;who takes stun damage is defying danger to do anything at all, the danger being &#39;you’re stunned.&#39;&quot; I&#39;ve always read that to mean the character can&#39;t take action if she fails to defy danger, for whatever reason. But The &quot;Debilities&quot; section uses the same term for temporary brain damage.<br /><br />Is there meant to be any connection between the conditions? Like if someone takes &quot;stun damage&quot; and fails to defy danger, does he suffer the &quot;Stunned&quot; debility? Or is it just a coincidence of language, with the conditions being independent? In the latter case, a character could be both &quot;stunned&quot; in the jaw-hanging-open sense and then be knocked in the head and suffer -1 INT too. Is that right?<br /><br />What kinds of attacks cause &quot;stun damage&quot; in your game? Would a blinding flash do it? A goblin suddenly dropping onto your helmet, making it get stuck over your eyes? Or is mainly for blackjacks and Vulcan nerve pinches?<br /><br />Can you think of examples of how you&#39;ve used &quot;stun damage&quot; and the &quot;Stunned&quot; debility? Thanks!

        <p>It&#39;s an unfortunate reuse. A lot of stun damage could totally make you Stunned, sure.</p>

        <p>Hmmm, during the Slave Pits of the Undercity module there&#39;s that big honking trap of a statue swinging a giant sword down on the unfortunate character triggering it. I pondered the failed defy danger move over that one and decided on the stunned debility as even though it is a great honking sword and all it&#39;s well, blunt rather than sharp and just seemed appropriate rather than just dealing damage.<br />I&#39;ve stunned a wizard on a spellcasting backlash as he had racked up so many -1&#39;s going forward cause he was having a bad spellcasting day and finally I stunned him and advised him that his brain was basically pudding and his nerves were shot from overextending himself.<br />I don&#39;t know how other game masters feel about debilities in regards to them being soft versus hard moves.</p>

        <p>I think debilities are a pretty hard move since they are difficult to remove and can potentially have a significant impact on the character&#39;s performance. Thrown about too freely, they can start to ruin the player&#39;s fun.<br /><br />That being said, they make a great hard move for those very reasons.</p>

        <p>HP come back pretty quick. If the fight is effectively already won and the party hasn&#39;t used enough resources I tend to throw a debility at the next opportunity, specifically <i>because</i> they hurt more.<br /><br />Usually they chug a potion, rather than wait three days. I&#39;m okay with that because those things are expensive.</p>
