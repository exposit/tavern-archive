Thank you to everyone that participated in  <a rel="nofollow" class="ot-hashtag" href="https://plus.google.com/s/%23DruidWeek/posts">#DruidWeek</a> . I can&#39;t really name specific people because i would forget half of you and that wouldn&#39;t be fair. Thanks to anyone that started discussions or joined in. Thanks to anyone that created content, posted stories or spread the word. Thanks to anyone that read and gave +1s. <br />Thanks to anyone who voted Druid during the kickstarter. <br /><br />I feel like Druid Week was an improvement over Fighter Week and we started really strong. There was so much discussion going on on monday. It&#39;s a bad sad we couldn&#39;t keep this level of engagement up over the whole week. I tried by starting discussions about the other Druid moves but that didn&#39;t really work out. It might say a thing or 2 about the Shapeshift move that a lot of questions were posted on that and not so much the other moves.<br /><br />I was really inspired by Druid Week. 4 of the CC i posted where directly inspired by the occasion, only the Druid of one form was planned beforehand. <br /><br />I think we need at least a 2 week breather before the next class week; if people still feel like it&#39;s a thing you want to do. We had a fighty and a magicy class now; i think the next one should be Thief.<br /><br />I am very open for any suggestions on how to improve the &quot;event&quot;, how to keep participation higher, what to aim for etc. <br /><br />Thanks again community.
