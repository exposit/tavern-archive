My players have started to run amok with the game and I&#39;m loving it, the only problem is I need help creating a move for a new magic item.<br /><br />My one player is a Charlatan, he&#39;s been using his cherry bombs almost exclusively in battle.  He wanted a way increase its distance and dmg output, so thanks to the help of the party Artificer and a LOT of gold he now has a Predator style  mounted cherry bomb launcher that&#39;s magically tied to his monocle and can retract into a backpack with 3 weight.<br /><br />.  We were using the volley rules at first but I think it deserves its own move, I just cant figure out what to do for 7-9 for failure it hits the nearest thing, probably an ally, on a 10 it hits no problem.  But I want a hard bargain for the 7-9.   I&#39;m stumped and could really use the communities help.<br /><br />So I&#39;m thinking When you target lock an enemy Roll+INT on a 10+ you are successful and lock on to the enemy  roll dmg. on a 7-9 Choose 1or 2?.  On a 6- it backfires and aims at the nearest creature/ally( haven&#39;t decided).<br />   Target lock takes longer to happen and you must put yourself in danger. ( I&#39;d like a more concrete action)<br />  ????

        <p>First, leave the 6- results undefined! Rolling a 6- means the GM gets to make a move, so you get a game with much more variety that way.</p>

        <p>Ideas for 7-9 results:<br />* it shoots something unintended (a bit broader than your nearest ally/enemy)<br />* it fires then jams. You&#39;ll have to spend a second fixing it before you can fire again.<br />* it ignites a second cherry bomb after firing! Resolve it as if you&#39;d shot yourself too.<br />* it shoots his monocle! Describe where it ends up, and who ends up wearing it.<br />* it leaves him in a spot (unoriginal, but still one of the best options out there)<br /><br />If you want a hard choice, something like:<br />The targetting software mucks up. Spend a moment fixing it, or your next shot will also hit your closest ally.<br /><br /><br />I would totally go for the monocle option.</p>

        <p>Its too late to make it a compendium class,  he already has it and I&#39;m not going to take one of his moves for it.</p>
