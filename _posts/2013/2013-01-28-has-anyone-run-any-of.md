Has anyone run any of the Dungeon Crawl Classics using Dungeon World? They&#39;re as easy to convert as any D&amp;D adventure, but I&#39;m curious how it panned out.

        <p>Honestly? They are super dull. The early adventures were full of secret doors that lead to nothing monsters that made no sense living near each other yet not interacting etc. <br /><br />We&#39;ve still had some great games despite this because our MC did really well. <br /><br /> Caveat: I am not a DnD person. I&#39;m a story gamer.<br /><br />Describing where you go/remembering to search for secret doors and traps = not fun IMHO.<br /><br />Poignant encounters as part of an emergent storyline that enables character conflicts and difficult moral choices = teh awesome!<br /><br />So...<br />I would suggest reading these old adventures, stealing the good bits, writing them into a dungeon starter and then playing to find out what happens.</p>

        <p>And Omg! I forgot. Making uninformed decisions on directs is not fun. It&#39;s super- not-fun when every third room is empty. Grr.</p>

        <p>Yeah, I was thinking in terms of anyone who had experience adapting them into dungeon fronts/starters.</p>
