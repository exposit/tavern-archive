We just started a new campaign of Adventures on Dungeon Planet and I was considering journaling the sessions and providing them in a public forum such as this one.<br /><br />Is this something that the members here would be interested in seeing? Is there a more appropriate forum that this one?<br /><br />Thanks!

        <p>I loved that book, but haven&#39;t had a chance to play or run it.  Seeing reports of someone else&#39;s game would be very cool.</p>

        <p>My group has an extremely intermittent Dungeon Planet game going.  Would love to read about another group in action :)</p>

        <p>For sure! The great thing about G+ ... if someone doesn&#39;t feel like reading it, they can just pass by the box.<br /><br />I love reading session journals.<br /><br />One of the more interesting things, when you can convince the players to do so, is to get IC Journals, it&#39;s wonderful to see things from not just a player, but often a character point of view, especially when different characters have different ideas how things went down.</p>

        <p>@ Doug I can certainly ask my players if they are interested. It is something I wouldn&#39;t mind seeing.</p>

        <p>Blog posts and forums threads are easier to find later than g+ posts are, I find, but you probably want to go with the format you&#39;re most comfortable with.</p>

        <p>I suppose I could use a blog of some kind and link it here on G+. Not being a blogger myself, can someone recommend one that&#39;s fairly user friendly?</p>

        <p>I&#39;d go with Blogger. I&#39;ve used in the past and it&#39;s very straightforward. Also, it&#39;s owned by Google, which would make it easy to share your posts here.</p>

        <p>Yeah a blog linked to regular G+ posts/updates is best IMO. As far as format, I really love what they do on Actual People Actual Play where the sessions are summarised in an exciting mini story. </p>
