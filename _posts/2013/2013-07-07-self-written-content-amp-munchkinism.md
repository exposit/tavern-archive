<b>Self Written Content &amp; Munchkinism</b><br /><br />I ran into a problem yesterday. I wanted to play a specific character with specific moves and realised i couldn&#39;t. A Wizard can&#39;t take a Druid Move at level 2. No multiclass move. <br />People like <span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink" href="https://plus.google.com/110625243561124101072" oid="110625243561124101072">Bernd Pressler</a></span> voiced the opinion that the Class System sometimes restrict you in the kind of character you want to play. You can&#39;t take a combination of certain moves, races and abilities. <br />For me this is okay, more often then not. Burning Wheel taught me that it is cool that you don&#39;t always get the character you want to play. <br />I later found out that i could create the character using the  <a rel="nofollow" class="ot-hashtag" href="https://plus.google.com/s/%23inverseworld/posts">#inverseworld</a>  Sky Dancer but it would take up to level 4 more or less. That is okay, you don&#39;t always get what you want immediately, sometimes you have to work on it. <br /><br /><span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink" href="https://plus.google.com/110937611143261107555" oid="110937611143261107555">Kasper Brohus</a></span> said i should just write a Compendium Class that would let me do what i wanted. For me that is cheating, what do you think? <br /><br />I guess it&#39;s one thing to write certain abilities into the game that didn&#39;t exist before. The Arcane Archer was written to have a magical/trick arrow archer in the game. I wrote it to have that potential option not to instantly play this gal. <br />Writing something just to get around the Class System is cheating however. You can write a CC that gives you exactly what you want and potentially with an easy trigger directly made for that character. <br />The answer to that problem: Make someone else write it. They will have another take on your concept and give you not exactly what you want but something that will push you into a new direction. <br /><br />The same goes for moves i think. Don&#39;t write a move because it would totally make sense for this one character you want to play. Write it because it makes sense for the whole class. <br /><br />I am not saying you can&#39;t write balanced and great stuff for yourself that won&#39;t hurt the game i just think it&#39;s a bit munchkiny. <br /><br />What do you think?

        <p>By the way, the easiest way to make my concept work is a magic item that would allow you to summon drakes. Just state that you are searching for that item in the first session when asked why you venture into the dungeon. <br />That is using the system for fun and profit. </p>

        <p>I&#39;m really not a fan of classes at all. I&#39;d rather start with only one move that sets me apart and then be able to freely multiclass. But, aren&#39;t we to follow the fiction? If your wizard encounters a primal spring and drinks waters that tap into the time before time when all things had no shape and could talk to each other without language, then I as the DM (with a consensus of the table) should offer you something akin to what you want. As far as writing a custom CC goes, again if the DM is on board and it makes sense in the fiction,  why not? Portray a fantastic world, anything can happen!</p>

        <p>Here&#39;s the thing. When I go out dancing, I can get on the dance floor, dance the way I want to, and instantly start having the exact type of fun I want to be having. When I decide to watch a DVD, nobody will say I&#39;m &quot;cheating&quot; if I stop watching a film I&#39;m not enjoying and pop in one I&#39;ll like better. <br /><br />So why shouldn&#39;t I be able to play the character I actually want to play, right from the beginning? Gaming is a leisure and entertainment activity, right? I don&#39;t have to &quot;earn&quot; my fun.</p>

        <p>But you don&#39;t go to a Salsa dancing event to dance Bourree right? When dance X is playing you dance a dance that is matching the music. <br /><br />When i want to play a group of princes in Princess drive why shouldn&#39;t i be able to play a group of boys from the beginning. <br /><br />There are certain restrictions in the game and they are there for a reason aren&#39;t they?</p>

        <p>But I can just as easily choose to go to a club where I can dance however the hell I want. Or do an &quot;80s Night&quot; where only the music is restricted. I should be able to choose the level and nature of restriction.</p>

        <p>Well, I&#39;m not going to send the Princess Police to your house to stop you. ;) it would make me wonder why you didn&#39;t pick a game more supportive of the themes you wanted to play with, though. <br /><br />That doesn&#39;t seem to be the case in your OP. it doesn&#39;t sound like you want a character that actually violates the expectations of DW, just one that would be hard to play as a beginning character without some custom content.</p>

        <p>Wouldn&#39;t it depend on your group, ultimately, to decide what is and isn&#39;t cheating? Different groups might have different opinions, of course. (To use your analogy, dance Bouree with your Bouree group and Salsa with a Salsa group.)</p>

        <p>BESM D20 worked out a point build system for d20. I imagine a similar system would work for DW. I&#39;ve started work on one but it needs fine tuning. As a base charge 1cp for a new feture on a move, 2 cp for a narrow new move and 4 cp for a broad one like spell casting. support moves are free. hp load &amp; damage die are a set. D4 (6hp, 4 load)is free, d6 is 1cp then double for each step. So d10 (12hp, 10 load) is 4cp. </p>

        <p>A lot of people houserule that all classes have multiclass dabbler, so long as you don&#39;t multiclass into classes someone else is playing.<br /><br />I don&#39;t think this is an unreasonable houserule. The limits on the multiclassing is really mostly a D&amp;D legacy mechanic. Feel free to dump it.</p>

        <p>This isn&#39;t really all that different from having a name that&#39;s not on the list. There are all sorts of strictures, and we chose which ones to apply to the gaming table. Some -- like class moves -- feel more sacred than others -- like Look -- but in the end, have the fun you want by telling the story you want with the character(s) you want to play. </p>
