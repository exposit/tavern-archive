I have a legitimate, 1st Edition e-copy of  <a rel="nofollow" class="ot-hashtag" href="https://plus.google.com/s/%23DungeonWorld/posts">#DungeonWorld</a>  sitting in my DropBox.  Paper copy on its way over the Atlantic. Can&#39;t wait to get reading!

        <p>Read over 50% of my <a rel="nofollow" class="ot-hashtag" href="https://plus.google.com/s/%23DungeonWorld/posts">#DungeonWorld</a> ebook last night, immediately before bed. Needless to say my dreams were callously invaded by orcs and goblins. But fear not! For my hand was true and my imaginary dream dice won through.<br /><br />As an added bonus, I awoke with some ideas.<br /><br />Bring on the impending doom!</p>
