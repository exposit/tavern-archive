So here&#39;s the setup I wrote for my players for tonight&#39;s session. (I used the formatting from World of Warcraft&#39;s patch notes, of all things, as a guide.) It was pretty fun to write, but time consuming!<br /><br /><i>As the ground continues to quake and ancient evils wake from old slumber, the factions vying for control of the Green Scar have been spurred into action. Tribesmen and civilisations alike make new preparations against the oncoming dangers. Meanwhile, a continent away, the &#39;true&#39; owners of the jungle may have already been decided...</i><br /><br /><b>I See You</b><br />For the first time in recorded history, the individual tribes of the jungle - the Bufo, the Vaagrim, the Ekek, and many more - will meet to discuss an alliance against the dangers that face them all. The Bloodcapes are willing to vouch for representatives from Brink - if they wish to join in the discussion and ensure the process goes smoothly. <br /><br /><b>Temples of Doom</b><br />Though it&#39;s rumoured death and desertion has led to a critical cut in funding, Professor Pontius Philiogus and his crack team of archaeologists are determined to lead one last expedition into the recently-uncovered depths to find the truth behind the ancient empire - and are asking for any able-bodied souls to join them.<br /><br /><b>You Can&#39;t Handle the Truth!</b><br />Before setting up above the canyon, the Brink family built a settlement in the jungle itself. The site was abandoned shortly after - no-one in the family has gone back since, claiming the entire area was &quot;haunted&quot;. With the threat of being legally - and forcibly - evicted from the Green Scar looming, the Brink family are looking for capable bodyguards to defend Chalcedon&#39;s foremost barrister, who has arrived at the Green Scar to ensure any lingering secrets at First Brink never see the light of day.
