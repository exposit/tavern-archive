Refraction.<br /><br /><b><i>Forbidden Magic.</i></b><br /><br />As dangerous as it is tantalizing. As tantalizing as it is dangerous.<br /><br />Let&#39;s discuss.<br /><br />Ideas for working within the system as is: When a wizard demonstrates mastery of forbidden magic, don&#39;t forget to roll Outstanding Warrants whenever they return to said steading. However, this also counts as a useful reputation towards recruiting hirelings, for certain definitions of &quot;useful&quot;. (Depends on the type of hireling you&#39;re trying to recruit, of course.)<br /><br />Also, Rituals can always include a &quot;You and your allies will risk the danger of anyone finding out that you&#39;re performing this sort of magic&quot; requirement at the GM&#39;s option, as an easy way to flag the fact that they&#39;re Dabbling In Things Of Which Their Peers Would Not Approve.<br /><br />And with that in mind, a miniCompendium Class to get the ball rolling:<br /><br />MASTER OF THE UNSPEAKABLE<br /><br />When you take up the practice of the forbidden arts, the following count as class moves for you:<br /><br />SINISTER MIEN: When you use the threat, or promise, of applying your forbidden magics as leverage to parley, roll with INT instead of CHA.<br /><br />SHORT CUTS: When you perform a ritual, you may replace any requirement with &quot;You and your allies will risk the danger of anyone finding out that you&#39;re performing this sort of magic.&quot; If you already have this requirement, you&#39;re compounding forbidden means onto forbidden ends, and are risking a very high chance of a very strong reaction indeed.<br /><br />FRIENDS IN LOW PLACES: When you use your reputation as a master of the forbidden arts to help recruit hirelings, Â you may automatically set their loyalty at +3 (fanatically loyal if a bit bumbling) or -2 (skilled but treacherous) before the GM sets their skills.
