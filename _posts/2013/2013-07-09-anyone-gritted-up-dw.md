Anyone gritted up DW?  I&#39;m not sure &#39;gritted&#39; is a word but that won&#39;t stop me.  The system is generally set up for fairly epic or high fantasy play, but our group is considering a darker and grittier world with few magic items, high deadliness, etc.  <br /><br />Anyone done a Warhammer-grit level game with DW?  Obviously the system is flexible but curious about actual play lessons.

        <p>Definitely.  All the time.  It&#39;s my default mode.</p>

        <p>I&#39;d actually argue that AW as-written is less gritty than Warhammer.  In AW you can be an ass-kicking badass.  In WHFRP you&#39;re almost always a piece of human garbage.  Or elven garbage, I guess.</p>

        <p>Ah! I was just about to say that I played a fair share of games with world of dungeons in a very gritty atmosphere (actually, there was more diablo than warhammer, but still).</p>

        <p>Not super familiar with WH or AW; what exactly do you mean by &#39;grit&#39;?</p>

        <p>Marienburg is cool and all, but it&#39;s still WoD based, so be ready to do a lot of on-the-fly work as the GM.</p>

        <p>By gritty I mean that combat is quite dangerous, the world is dark, oppressive, and grim, and the characters are underpowered compared to many threats. Running away is often very wise, unless you&#39;re strategic, sneaky and smart.  Not to say characters can&#39;t grow and become mighty, but it&#39;s a long road.<br /><br />In DW characters are pretty impressive compared to the average person from the start- a fighter can wallop half a dozen goblins no problem.  In my head, gritty means a level 1 fighter can wallop 2 goblins, no problem.  4 goblins is getting nasty, and you may lose a limb.  6 goblins means run, or have lots of oil and a torch.  Using harder moves is definitely part of the answer I think. <br /><br />Also, I should have said not quite as desperate a setting as Warhammer.  I don&#39;t want a party of cobblers and stable hand heading into the wilderness... or wait, maybe I do but not in this instance.  <br /><br />Lots of good advice, many thanks!  Not looking specifically for a skin of WH but will definitely check out Marienburg for some inspiration.</p>

        <p>If/when it comes out, tremulus might be something you could look into. Write up a dark fantasy playset, maybe re-skin a playbook or two and bam!</p>

        <p>The few games I have been in has been both gritty and heroic at the same time.</p>

        <p>I think a gritty level could just be achieved by doing more hard moves more often, and also giving the Messy tag to most weapons and monsters. Nobody will go happily into a fight against two goblins if they know that a lucky blow will result in a severed hand or their guts spilled in the dirt... </p>

        <p>In my games, &quot;a handful of goblins&quot; can be a life-or-death scenario. It&#39;s all about working together with the players to create a well-understood fictional positioning for everyone that says they aren&#39;t superheroes, but just some mere mortals with a sliver of power. As the GM, describe a 10+ as a lucky break or a moment of surety, and describe a 6- as the inevitable, awful reality coming to pass. Position every monster as though you were emulating the 16hp dragon, and the message you&#39;re looking for will come through. <br /><br />Just make sure your players are on-board, first.</p>
