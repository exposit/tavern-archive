I was trying to think of the right move for a player to roll when they attempt to taunt an NPC into taking an aggressive action. For example, insult the ogre so he charges you without noticing the pile of traps you’ve set for him. Parley doesn’t really seem to fit so I created the following custom move:<br /> <br />Taunt Into Action<br />When you attempt to persuade an NPC into a particular aggressive course of action via insulting taunts, roll +CHA. *On a 10+, both. *On a 7-9, choose one:<br />…They take the action you desired<br />…They do not discern your ulterior motives<br /><br />However, now I am thinking this might just be a specific example of the Defy Danger move. What do you think?

        <p>Why would he take the action you desired if he knew your ulterior motive?</p>

        <p>How about &quot;on a 7-9, the response is more enthusiastic than expected. The target&#39;s aggressive actions put you into a dangerous situation.&quot;?</p>

        <p>Hi Joel, if the player rolled a 7-9 and choose to have the Ogre charge him, the Ogre might sense something is amiss and take an indirect route or smash the trap on the way. If you were trying to distract the Ogre from a weakened companion, he might realize that your friend is important to you and drag him along while charging you.<br /><br />However, I think I like Colter&#39;s suggestion better since it is much cleaner.</p>

        <p>Well you could say you are defying Danger with +Cha. The danger beeing, that your companion get&#39;s attacked. </p>

        <p>You&#39;ve discovered the Dread Secret of Dungeon World!  <b>Everything</b> is just a specific example of Defy Danger.</p>

        <p>Agree with <span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink" href="https://plus.google.com/110330901807759406775" oid="110330901807759406775">Tim Franzke</a></span>. Unless the custom move is vital to portraying a particular way your campaign world works, you can usually get by with just Defy Danger.</p>

        <p>Thanks for the clarification. Using Defy Danger makes a lot more sense after hearing Tim&#39;s explaination.</p>

        <p>I would make the choices 10+ both, 7-9 one: <br />- it does not get +1 to acta against you<br />- you got it where you wanted</p>

        <p>Giving a monster +1 against you doesn&#39;t make any sense, as monsters do not roll dice.</p>
