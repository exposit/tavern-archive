So I&#39;m working on writing Eberron conversions for other classes, starting with the Mage. One of the potential changes I&#39;m offering is the dragonmarked mage, but I&#39;m having trouble making Spell Foci out of the Marks. Here&#39;s what I have so far:<br /><br /><b>Mark of Detection</b><br />Aligned: Foretell Destiny, Peel Back the Veil, Reveal Grim Portents<br />Opposed:<br /><br /><b>Mark of Finding</b><br />Aligned: Reveal the Way Forward, <br />Opposed: <br /><br /><b>Mark of Handling</b><br />Aligned: Rampant Growth, <br />Opposed: <br /><br /><b>Mark of Healing</b><br />Aligned: Healing and Mending, <br />Opposed: <br /><br /><b>Mark of Hospitality</b><br />Aligned: Purification, Providing the Comforts of Home, <br />Opposed: <br /><br /><b>Mark of Making</b><br />Aligned: Create the Artificial, Make Whole, Iron and Steel<br />Opposed: <br /><br /><b>Mark of Passage</b><br />Aligned: Grant Freedom or Movement, <br />Opposed: Forcing or Restricting Movement<br /><br /><b>Mark of Scribing</b><br />Aligned: <br />Opposed: Unmake Anything, Hiding the Truth<br /><br /><b>Mark of Sentinel</b><br />Aligned: Give Strength to the Weak, <br />Opposed: <br /><br /><b>Mark of Shadow</b><br />Aligned: Dance with Shadows, Incite Terror or Panic, Shroud the Truth<br />Opposed: Fire and Light, Being Loud or Obvious<br /><br /><b>Mark of Storm</b><br />Aligned: Fog and Lightning, Control Wind and Rain, Move like the Wind<br />Opposed: Stasis and Calm, Creating Anything Solid or Permanent<br /><br /><b>Mark of Warding</b><br />Aligned: <br />Opposed: <br /><br /><b>Aberrant Mark</b><br />Aligned: Conjure Horrors, Corrupt the Innocent, Transfigure Living Flesh<br />Opposed: Purification or Enhancement, Using Spells that Aren’t Horrifying<br /><br />Can anyone help me?

        <p>Thanks, <span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink" href="https://plus.google.com/105149460475600709454" oid="105149460475600709454">Hannah Forster</a></span>! That&#39;s exactly what I needed! I think that this is the only time I&#39;ll break from using races for Eberron (I&#39;m even doing races for Inverse World classes), instead opting for a power source type of thing.</p>
