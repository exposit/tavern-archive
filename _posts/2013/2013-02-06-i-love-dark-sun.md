I love Dark Sun. And I&#39;ve really been enjoying Dungeon World. Happily my players agree with both points, and after trying two Dungeon World one-shots we&#39;re going to be doing a campaign in a post-apocalyptic fantasy world named Lyth. To get the ones who don&#39;t know the post-apocalyptic fantasy genre onto the same page as everyone else, I made this small setting document that I figured I&#39;d also share with the community.<br /><br />My goal here was to get players up to speed enough to narrate elements of the ruined world themselves. It&#39;s still missing stuff -- more GM moves, principles, monsters and magic -- but given that I haven&#39;t yet played it myself I don&#39;t really know what moves I&#39;ll be making or what cool monsters we&#39;ll create. And I was hoping that the awesome community here would have some cool ideas I could incorporate!<br /><br />So without further ado, here&#39;s my take on Dark Sun, a la Dungeon World.

        <p>I&#39;m really curious about this... On the one hand, I think players appreciate some context.  On the other hand, I&#39;ve had someone far more familiar with DW than I am more or less tell me &quot;you&#39;re doing it wrong&quot;.  What are other people&#39;s opinions?   Is it okay to build a sketch of a setting with lots of blanks, or should we leave the page entirely devoid of content only to be filled after the first session?  What&#39;s the role of &quot;classic&quot; settings like FR, Greyhawk or even Eberron and Dark Sun in the world envisioned by DW? </p>

        <p>Personally, Dungeon World seems to come with certain setting assumptions attached: mechanically, regarding elements like magic and divine power, and thematically, with various classes and the moves they can make. &quot;Under a Sickened Sky&quot; grew out of my desire to alter these baseline assumptions. On top of that, many players and GMs also have a shared vision of a Greyhawk/FR world and the elements it contains, that I feel that Dungeon World implicitly encourages -- enchanted forests, planar monsters, undead tombs... Dark Sun is different enough, and DW gives players enough narrative control, that calling out generalized setting elements (a toxic jungle, a shattered land, a city of a Priest-King) helps get everyone on the same page for introducing thematically-linked elements, and ultimately create a cohesive story together.</p>

        <p>Ah, this is brilliant. Have you seen the Gladiator class written by GimpInBlack on the SA forums?<br /><br /><a href="http://www.mediafire.com/view/?ob8ewooe1g3lebc" class="ot-anchor">http://www.mediafire.com/view/?ob8ewooe1g3lebc</a></p>

        <p>It&#39;s a very different take on how to approach setting than the core DW / AW games tend to take.  <br /><br />That doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s bad!  I&#39;ll have to devote the time to read it word-for-word before I can say more!</p>

GimpInBlack is actively working on Dark Sun Dungeon World on SA.</p>

        <p>Jacob Randolph did the Artisan, Mage, Priest and Templar.  I highly recommend them.  They take a step away from the leveling baggage of D&amp;D: no more spell lists and the Templar allows for a knight of good, lawful and evil alignments, and really adds a lot to that niche. </p>
