A weird idea - has anyone considered taking some of Â the ideas in Adventures on the Dungeon Planet (Engine of Destruction, Mutant, Technician, android), possibly Metamorphica (Europa needs mutants!) for ideas to create a Girl Genius Dungeon World?

        <p>I can&#39;t believe this idea had never occurred to me, seeing as I had been tossing around a Girl Genius D&amp;D hack several years ago. You could create some pretty amazing playbooks for that world.</p>
