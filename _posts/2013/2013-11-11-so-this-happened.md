So this happened.  I put together what started as a conversion of Beguiler from 3.5 PHBII, ended up throwing out almost everything, and this is what I ended up with.  Its a little rough looking but the playtesters who&#39;ve played it thought it was pretty fun.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.mediafire.com/view/armlrbmnfzd608t/The_Beguiler.pdf" class="ot-anchor">http://www.mediafire.com/view/armlrbmnfzd608t/The_Beguiler.pdf</a><br /><br />Constructive criticism is always welcome.

        <p>1. I would make your choose 2 list under gear an advanced move.<br />2.Not a play book that you would ever use in a dungeon crawl but you knew that.<br />3, Of the base classes and IW classes only bard has a d6 or smaller damage dice without a move that gives them a bunch of different options( wizard-spells, Cleric-spells, Captain-Minions/Cannons, Druid-Animals)<br />4. Daggers behind smiles is the only &quot;gives you leverage&quot; move I&#39;ve ever seen that I like<br />5. Like the druid, beguilers cloak gives no time frame(which may or may not be a bad thing)<br />6. hypnotic command would be smoother if it were 10+ 1 simple command <br />7. props for making a CHA class<br />8. Both hypnotic command and beguilers cloak are powerful enough to be this class&#39;s signature move<br />9. all your weapon options have the precise tag(normally quite rare and valuable cos of the implied ability to dump STR)<br />10.Its 2am<br />11.Thoughtsend with little voices is absurdly powerful<br />12. Overall good but powerful<br />12.5 Personally I like IW&#39;s Worldly multiclass move(A move from any playbook not in use) but strictly defined good multiclass moves are all but impossible so meh</p>

I&#39;d thought about it, but I&#39;m really tight on space as it is and Beguiler is helped a lot by exotic, weird tools that add legitimacy to their acts.<br />2. I&#39;ve had a little success with them in dungeons but they&#39;re very much more about making openings and using lateral thinking.  Beguilers Cloak and Hypnotic Command come in handy but they aren&#39;t direct attacks.  Basically agreeing with you, though, in a straight up dungeon crawl don&#39;t bring a Beguiler unless you have a plan.<br />3.  I&#39;ll run a playtest with a d8 but the class already has a lot of options, especially with Cloak of Invisibility added into the mix.  You just have to get... creative.  D20 would never accommodate a class like this though, that&#39;s for damn sure.<br />4. Aw, shucks, thanks!  Daggers Behind Smiles was the original move that the class was built on.  A lot of heist movies have people who trust strong authority figures immediately, but there&#39;s no mechanic to make sure that can happen.  Daggers expedites that process.<br />5. Yeah, if it were d20 I would absolutely put a time limit on it.  DW tends to be a little more lenient about these things, though, and it allows you to run deep cover for days if you have to.  Hopefully you don&#39;t have to, but the option is always there.<br />6. Hypnotic Command is based on the first level d20 spell &quot;Command.&quot;  While I thought it&#39;d be cute to keep with the original Command mechanic, it may end up being too fidgety.  Your suggestion might be worth considering.  (It does obsolete the Mystic Cabal background which is a lot of fun though)<br />7. I like characters where you get to talk your way through problems.  Beguiler has some tools to talk your way through certain problems.  =3<br />8. Yeah those two are Beguiler&#39;s bread and butter.  Thoughtsend and Daggers Behind Smiles are really just cute tricks, Thoughtsend especially was a last minute addition that the playtesters really loved.<br />9. This is a really good point, actually.  There isn&#39;t really a +STR option, I can probably come up with something though.<br />10. Thank you for staying up and talking with me about my class, I really appreciate the feedback!<br />11. The combination is potent, certainly, but very, very narrowly focused.  I think its reasonable, especially because you&#39;re giving up other equally potent options.<br />12. Thank you!  Honest question, if a player asked if they could play this as-is in your game, would you let them?<br />12.5. Yeah I couldn&#39;t really think of anything really good in the way of multiclass moves.  I wanted to give it access to a little bit in the way of options, but nothing TOO special.  The original draft had One With Nothing at 6-10 which was another instance of the same thing.  I&#39;m glad that I somehow forgot to find room, because two multiclass moves on a class this powerful would be kind of irresponsible.</p>
