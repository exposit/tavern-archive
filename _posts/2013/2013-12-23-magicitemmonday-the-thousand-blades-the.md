 <a rel="nofollow" class="ot-hashtag" href="https://plus.google.com/s/%23MagicItemMonday/posts">#MagicItemMonday</a> <br /><br />The Thousand Blades<br /><br /><br />&quot;The officers surrounded the Shadow Thief, and his hands flew into the sleeves of his robe. As he extended his hands, it was as if a thousand blades sprung from his fingertips and into my men&#39;s armor, and they crumbled as wheat before the scythe...&quot;<br /><br /><br />This silk robe has long sleeves and many small pockets concealed within it. When worn for the first time, 3d6 magical throwing knives appear within the robe&#39;s sleeves and myriad pockets. These can be drawn and thrown only by the wearer. Additionally, the wearer may Blot Out the Sun with the throwing knives, as if he had the ranger move of the same name.<br /><br />When the wearer of the Thousand Blades steals a treasure from someone wealthy and gives away the profits to the poor, the robe recharges, and another 3d6 throwing knives may be drawn from it. Any leftover knives from the previous draw are lost, unless the number remaining is greater than the amount rolled on the new draw.
