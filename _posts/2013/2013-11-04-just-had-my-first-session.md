Just had my first session as a GM and the game freaking rocks! The only aspect I&#39;m not entirely sure&#39;s about the money, how much should I give to the pc? How much is too much and how much is too little? Thanks!

        <p>Glad you enjoyed it! And I think it all depends on how you want to play your sessions. I&#39;ll note that for me, gold is largely there, like most things, for its narrative element. A PC either has enough to stay in an inn, or not- enough to spend lavishly carousing the town, or not. So work out what flavour you want to add to your sessions (broke adventurers on the outskirts of town, or wealthy travelers shouting drinks for the townfolk) and then award accordingly! The default carouse move is 100 gold.<br /><br />Oh and another note, items with badass names and custom moves will always be way more exciting to receive at the end of an adventure than a chest full of gold. So if they deserve a reward, try looking in that direction!</p>

        <p>Money is a little fuzzy.  Forcing character to burn through equipment is one of the ways you, as a GM, have of influencing them in a desired way.  Money, of course, can replenish their &quot;stuff&quot;.  Tom much money, and they&#39;ll have too much stuff - unless you exert some other control on their replenishment (such as keeping them away from places to purchase stuff).  Where am I going with this?  I dunno.  You need to find that comfort spot for yourself based on the controls you have to make replenishment something the plays need to think about and plan for.</p>

        <p>Also, roll on that page <i>during</i> the game. Or even better, let the <i>players</i> roll on it. Their greedy little faces are priceless xD</p>

        <p>Yeah, there&#39;s no expected wealth level. It should just fit with the fiction. That said, most fighters and paladins would love to get a Full Plate at some point ;)</p>

        <p>If you start to feel like they have too much money/items/etc, then make your hard moves to take their stuff away harder.  They&#39;re doing fantastic deeds, which means high reward and high price.  Let them feel like they&#39;re set for a bit, and enjoy the wealth, then start taking it away.  </p>

        <p>Being rich can set you off on adventures like Tony Stark and Bruce Wayne. But being poor can do the same. So keep money consistent with the story.</p>
