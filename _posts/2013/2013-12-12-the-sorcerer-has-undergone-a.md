The Sorcerer has undergone a substantial rewrite, and a lot has been moved to the scrap heap. The new focus is on emotions, their link to Sorcery, and a touch of precognitive dreams. I&#39;m about 6 moves short though, so I&#39;m fishing for ideas.<br /><br />I added a section that suggests possible applications for talents related to certain emotions as a way of explaining the possible scope of the Sorcerer&#39;s magic, but I&#39;m not sure if it&#39;s too restrictive or provides direction and guidance.<br /><br />The Sorcerer has probably had the most change and iterative rewrites since I did the Spellslinger, which is interesting. I wonder if it&#39;s the nature of caster-types or if it&#39;s just taken me longer to pin down an archetype with these two classes than the Fae, Fool, and Giant.

        <p>I love the emotional focus, it totally rules. Should make for a really interesting character to play, too! I&#39;m out of time for DW stuff, but will hopefully have extensive criticism up tomorrow. Until then, love it :D</p>

        <p>Looks good to me so far. It&#39;s not just you who has trouble nailing down spellcasters; I&#39;m working on v.3 of my Artificer for my Eberron conversion, and I&#39;m running into the same problem of solidifying the concept.</p>

        <p>Does your Artificer have moves for creating technology or conveniences that change society or provide a steady income? Practical use for magical items seems like a fertile field for the class.</p>

        <p>I was actually approaching it more from the innovator angle. I think Keith Baker said it best when he said that magewrights were the electricians of Eberron, artificers were the Teslas and Edisons. But perhaps &quot;finding a practical use for a magic item&quot; could be the Lawful alignment move?</p>

        <p>This is a very cool take. I especially like the Wither mechanic giving the GM tools to balance risk/reward.Â </p>
