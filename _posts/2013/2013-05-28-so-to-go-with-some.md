So to go with some of the other pictures I uploaded and monsters, looking for a custom move. I know the folks here in the community are super helpful for making sure moves aren&#39;t flat or boring or uninteresting so helpful advice is welcome on this move.<br /><br />I like the idea of crowded tent markets like the one in the picture. At some point I could easily see there being a chase, such as when a lost one grabs something from the pcs. So here is my custom move for a chase through the crowded tent markets surrounding the ruins of Wang Fu.<br /><br />When you chase a dangerous person/thing through the crowded tent markets of Wang Fu roll + DEX: *on a 10+, choose 3 *on a 7-9,  choose 2<br />- You avoid crashing into someone&#39;s stall and knocking all of you over with a load crash that breaks several valuable things (implied you still &quot;catch&quot; them)<br />- You manage to catch them before they get to others who can help them<br />- You manage to catch them before the chase has gotten the attention of locals that are likely to surround a group causing trouble in the markets<br />- You manage to catch them, but you are winded taking -1 forward on your next STR, DEX, or CON move. <br /><br />Looking for any help in making this a better move.<br /><br /> <a rel="nofollow" class="ot-hashtag" href="https://plus.google.com/s/%23WangFu/posts">#WangFu</a>  <br />-

        <p>A lot of those options are very specific,like the &quot;gang of locals&quot; and crashing into stalls. Personally I like to paint broad with the move and let the fine details be filled in by the fiction that is currently going on in the game.<br /><br />Also your first 2 options are actually complete successes if you read them. Avoid breaking stuff and catch them (that&#39;s a 10) and catch them before they get to allies (that&#39;s a 10). The only &quot;partial success&quot; are the last 2 options where the players have actually consequences to the roll.<br /><br />I would write something broad that the GM can fit into their fiction like this for example:<br /><br />10 - You manage to catch them.<br /><br />7-9 Pick one:<br />--You catch them but there&#39;s a cost (You&#39;ve caused property damage, he got to his friends and they are ready to fight, the guards stop you both and your hauled away together, you twist your ankle chasing them, etc...)<br /><br />--You lose them but they&#39;ve left a clue (they dropped their package, an eyewitness can identify them, you saw what direction they were headed to and can track them, etc)<br /><br />That&#39;s my 2 cents hope it was helpful.</p>
