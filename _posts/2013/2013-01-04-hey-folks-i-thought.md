Hey folks - I thought I&#39;d post some of the stats I&#39;ve been using for running the old AD&amp;D module &quot;Steading of the Hill Giant Chief&quot; for Dungeon World up at my blog. This first lot is for the giants, in addition to the Hill Giant in the Dungeon World book; I&#39;ll post the hill giants&#39; minions and other critters next time. Hope you like them. :-)

It looks like we’ll be playing our third session of Dungeon World this weekend, adventuring through that hoary old AD&D classic, G1 – Steading of the Hill Giant Chief. I’ll wr...

        <p>Sarah, Those are frightening stats. Nosnra on his own could well be a match for the 16HP Dragon.</p>

        <p>Hi Declan, :-)<br /><br />Nosnra is certainly meant to be a badass - the big Boss Fight dude. I haven&#39;t actually played him through yet, though I don&#39;t think he has quite the kill potential of the dragon. But, sure, you don&#39;t want to be getting into Hack &amp; Slash with him unless you&#39;ve got some serious armour and damage potential yourself. I&#39;m imagining there&#39;ll be a lot of ducking behind giant furniture and tactical manoeuvres with him - and a strong chance the fight won&#39;t be conclusive. I&#39;m experimenting with gradations of lethality / competence with the DW stat blocks and rules - looking forwards to playing it. :-)</p>

        <p>If nothing else, the fact that he can&#39;t rain fire on you while hovering over the battlefield gives a SLIGHT edge to the dragon.</p>

        <p>Yeah, but Nosnra can fling boulders at that flying dragon with disturbing accuracy ;)</p>

        <p>I was thinking from the perspective of a party of adventurers deciding who they&#39;d dread more.<br /><br />They could probably have a pretty even fight.</p>
