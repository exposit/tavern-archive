So, I have tried to build up a new Knight playbook for a campaign I am porting to DW.<br /><br />Here you are<br /><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Z07C4Qh0hRZAS-7MatTSA5ZGYPdokfstyYNuvKX7Eo0/edit?usp=sharing" class="ot-anchor">https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Z07C4Qh0hRZAS-7MatTSA5ZGYPdokfstyYNuvKX7Eo0/edit?usp=sharing</a><br /><br />It is almost nothing my work, I just merged the Knight of wrl here <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XCbJg1MABqTfqaofvXs7SXbiRRwuzFJQQy85G7M3Fs4/edit?pli=1" class="ot-anchor">https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XCbJg1MABqTfqaofvXs7SXbiRRwuzFJQQy85G7M3Fs4/edit?pli=1</a><br />with the Knight of Solamnia of <span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink" href="https://plus.google.com/115186961903970956082" oid="115186961903970956082">Jeremie Wade</a></span> and the Paladin in order to be less focused on the mount and more on knightly duties and orders.<br /><br />It&#39;s a fast and furious wrap up, I have to play it tomorrow evening, and I need to work also on the wordig, but it is still something.

        <p>For the Human race move, I think you mean CHA, not CAR. Unless the Humans gain a bonus to their sweet ride. The whole move doesn&#39;t make much sense as written, however.<br /><br />The Evil alignment option and the Orders of the Temple and Rose have been removed. Why?</p>

        <p>I amended the CHA<br />I apologize, English is not my native language, the move is grammatically wrong or do you think it is not useful?<br /><br />I tried something more like a knight of the round table, so the Evil alignement do not fit with my idea<br /><br />The order of temple seems to me a copy of Paladin, while the order of the Rose did not inspire me as really knightly </p>
