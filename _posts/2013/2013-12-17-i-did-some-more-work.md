I did some more work on my alt chargen thing for DW.<br /><a href="http://redboxvancouver.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/class_warfare_20131216.pdf" class="ot-anchor">http://redboxvancouver.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/class_warfare_20131216.pdf</a><br />If you try it out, let me know how it goes.

        <p>Just at a glance, I&#39;d only read through the Disciples section so far:<br /><br />&quot;You may instead choose only two disciple specialties instead of three.&quot; (p.6).<br /><br />Can you take the same speciality multiple times? I think it would work better if you can&#39;t.<br /><br />Halfling Devoted&#39;s racial should probably just be &quot;choose one of your deity&#39;s domains; when you Spout Lore about that, +1,&quot; otherwise it has no effect if you don&#39;t choose an additional domain.<br /><br />Circle of Protection could probably do with being &quot;it keeps spirits&quot; instead of &quot;a spirit.&quot;<br /><br />Should the Martial Hero have a &quot;your body is a weapon&quot; move as a starting move? My gut feeling is yes.</p>

        <p>Yeah, good catches, I&#39;ll change those. Two specialties are for people who really, really like one specialty in particular and are probably going to max out on it anyway, so there&#39;s no point in making them take a third one. You can make characters like the IW Mechanic, for example, doing that, although choosing two specialties with not a lot of moves in them will kinda bite you I guess.</p>

        <p>I was specifically asking about e.g. taking the Crusader twice to boost your damage die to d10. I&#39;m guessing you&#39;re not supposed to (I get the rules for specifically only take two specialties and getting a free 2-5 advance instead of the extra starting moves).<br /><br />Either way, it&#39;s an interesting system - I&#39;ll go over the rest later tonight if I have the time.</p>

        <p>Wow, this looks really neat! a lot like more traditional character creation, where you pick your list of abilities. Similar to Legend. I&#39;ll try this out with my group, and we&#39;ll see how it goes.</p>

I&#39;ll add a note at some point specifically saying you can&#39;t take the same one twice, just to be clear.<br /><br /><span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink" href="https://plus.google.com/116124411286229550721" oid="116124411286229550721">David Schirduan</a></span>  Thanks! I&#39;m also hoping it will help people write new base classes, like if they have an idea for a compendium class and want to bump it up to a base class, or if they have a specific setting idea and want to make a set of classes (in whole or in part) that aren&#39;t ones already available.</p>

        <p>I love this stuff! Looks like alot has been added since the last playtest I looked at from November.  The Disciple section is interesting.  My favorite so far is the Impervious. I had a character back in the day that was the definition of Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken.  Nice work!<br />And really, who can resist a Game of Thrones reference in a DW move?</p>
