Has anyone ever tried to make a reluctant adventurer class ala Bilbo baggins from the hobbit? Or other fairy tails like stardust. Sort of a take on the modern mixing with the fantastic. Not sure it would be fun to play or not, but think that DW would be the game to do it.

        <p>Probably best as either a narrative or a Compendium Class. <b>When you are dragged reluctantly from your doorstep on an adventure of grandiose proportions,</b> you may take the following move instead of a class move when you advance.<br /><br />I don&#39;t know that the &quot;reluctant adventurer&quot; concept has enough &quot;oomph&quot; to necessitate a playbook. But I like the idea.</p>

        <p>Dungeon Planet&#39;s Earthling can be like that.</p>

        <p>I bet reluctant heroes are the ones that get invited in when you go to town, I bet you never see warrants out for them, I bet carousing is super safe for them on account of being overshadowed by&quot;real heroes&quot;.</p>

        <p>Definitely a Compendium Class.  The full classes are classes because they are the best at DOING something, not because of their attitude or objectives.  </p>

        <p>I wrote alternate playbooks for a Redwall hack once, and they included the Abbey-Dweller, &#39;cause in those books there&#39;s always some fat and jolly hedgehog or whatever that has to come along on the quest but just gets homesick. I&#39;m most proud of this advanced move:<br />Growing On You: name up to three of your companions. They each immediately get a new bond with you, choosing between the following:<br />– <i>____</i> never should have come with us<br />– I must see to <i>____</i>’s safe return<br />– I envy <i>____</i> for their peaceful life<br /><br />It has plenty of reluctant I think, and coming from a peaceful, civilised background. Maybe not modern so much, unless you mean wealthy and sheltered.<br /><br />The entire hack is here: <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/11hL4lEG_Qi1eiINCQGkDR32F8KNl4x_hCvHBp5-Wg7A/edit#" class="ot-anchor">https://docs.google.com/document/d/11hL4lEG_Qi1eiINCQGkDR32F8KNl4x_hCvHBp5-Wg7A/edit#</a></p>

        <p>But bilbo was really good at doing something. He was good at figuring things out that the others really couldn&#39;t - he wanted to be brave and figured out most the steps in the journey to get to the end of the story. He does most of the interesting things in the story. I will cogitate on this for a while, I think there is something there for the right kind of game.</p>

        <p>Maybe a playbook that all the other players share access to and can inhabit for a bit, once each session.</p>
