Hey! For  <a rel="nofollow" class="ot-hashtag" href="https://plus.google.com/s/%23wizardweek/posts">#wizardweek</a>  Â I&#39;m going to share a preview of my take on magic users: The Alchemist.<br />I&#39;ve been working on this class on-and-off for a few months now and it&#39;s just-about finished playtesting, almost ready for sale! The class is focused around brewing potions and then using them to do crazy things.<br /><br />It works via a tag system that lets players describe what effects the potions have. For example, a freezing potion used with Belch could create an ice-bridge, or used with Transform could make the alchemist undetectable to a heat-seeking monster or able to freeze creatures on touch, or might hold a far away enemy frozen in place with Voodoo.<br /><br />The (20+) advanced moves are mainly based around grabbing more tags (e.g. making potions from monster bits gives you one of the monster&#39;s tags) and using potions in increasingly crazy ways. E.g. Voodoo, where you down a potion, choose an enemy, and the effects hit them. And you too, if you&#39;re unlucky! Of course, no Alchemist is complete without the ability to transmute, fooling merchants with gold coins that revert back to copper or turning their enemies into lead statues .

        <p>Glad you like the sound of it! I&#39;m looking for ideas for more tags for potions: are there any anyone would paricularly like in the Alchemist&#39;s basic toolbox? My favourite defaults are probably:<br />freezing, flaming, electric, toxic, acidic. In other words, the elemental stuff</p>
