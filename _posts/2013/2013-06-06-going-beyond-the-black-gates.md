<b>Going beyond the Black Gates in Dungeon Planet</b><br /><br />Does this manifest the same in your Dungeon Planet games as it does in DW?  Is Death a chromed skeletal cyborg with a laser scythe?  Is Death anthropomorphized at all in your game? <br />I ask because I&#39;m breaking ground on Dungeon Planet this weekend and I want to be prepared for the <del>best</del> worst and I&#39;m interested to see how other people have repped the reaper in planetary romance.
