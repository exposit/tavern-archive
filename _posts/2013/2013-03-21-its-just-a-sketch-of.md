It&#39;s just a sketch of a move that came up giing to work.<br /><br />When you <b>fight in the Phersy Arena</b>, roll+STR.<br />On a hit, you manage to fight your way to the final round.<br />On a 10+, choose 3. On a 7-9, choose 1.<br />-you impress the audience fighting with great valor, many will remember your name for a long time.<br />-someone wealthy offers you a tempting job.<br />-you do not suffer heavy wounds.<br />-someone has bet on you and shares part of what he has won. You also share some common enmity.<br /><br />(Sorry for my english!)<br /><br />It&#39;s just a very rough sketch, but one can add different choices to make it fit in different campaign.. <br />Now I wonder:<br />-what or who do you fight with into the arena? Beasts? Inmates?<br />-is it against the law?<br />-what is the prize? Glory and honor? Titles? Freedom? <br />-the arena fights happen every week? Month? Year? On festivity?<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />
