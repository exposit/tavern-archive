So I&#39;m getting ready to run a game for my regular rp group and one of my players wants to play a horse warrior. Like a mongol or a dothraki. Do we already have a class that covers that? Or does it need building from scratch?

        <p>I&#39;ve made a class called the Cavalier. I&#39;ll link to it in a minute or two. It kind of also focuses on courtly stuff, so you may need to reflavor those moves.</p>

It is fantasy, after all) and bow at first level. Then let him choose Ranger moves with his multiclass for Animal Companion and Command.</p>

        <p>Sounds like a compendium class to me. I&#39;d rather not make it a separate base class because it would overlap significantly with the other front-line fighters and any time that you&#39;re without your horse, you lose a major functionality of the class. <br /><br />I&#39;ll get back to you tonight, see if I have any brainstorms.</p>

That being said I&#39;m still interested in seeing what you come up with. <br /><br /><span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink" href="https://plus.google.com/102768177673605279668" oid="102768177673605279668">Giovanni Lanza</a></span> that is a really neat concept. Personally I love the whole honor thing. It&#39;s not really what I&#39;m looking for but I like the idea of damage being increased while mounted. I&#39;m probably just gonna build a horse warrior class but I&#39;m stealing that idea from you for sure. <br /></p>

        <p>I had an idea of statting out Horses as weapons a while ago (e.g. Warhorse. close, reach, +2 damage, +1 armor, clumsy, 400 coins, load 12)... you could then let them use the base Fighter class with the option of selecting their Horse as their &quot;signature weapon&quot;... and then put a modified version of the Ranger Animal Companion as a 2-5 Move?<br />I can totally understand wanting to build a class from the ground up, though... sometimes it just fits better thematically.</p>

It&#39;s interesting that there are so many parallels between a knight and a samurai. I have to avoid the temptation to use Japanese terms in my writing.</p>
