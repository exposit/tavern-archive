Hey guys, <br /><br />perhaps ypi can help me out with two quick questions:<br /><br />- Is there a Pulp Hack for Dungeon World? Kinda Indiana Jones Style?<br />- Is there a hack out there that uses some kind of Bennies / Stylepoints / Fatepoints?<br /><br />Thx in advance!<br /><br />David

        <p>There is Whispering Willows. A *World hack that uses Bennies i think. </p>

        <p>Johnstone Metzger&#39;s <i>Adventures on Dungeon Planet</i> hits science fantasy pulp style - not Indiana Jones but you could definitely lift some bits of it.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.dungeon-world.com/adventures-on-dungeon-planet/" class="ot-anchor">http://www.dungeon-world.com/adventures-on-dungeon-planet/</a></p>

        <p>I&#39;m not clear on what you would want the fate points/bennies to actually do in DW, but whatever it is, all you would need to do is write a pair of moves (one for gaining them, one for spending them) to add it to DW.<br /><br />e; in fact, alignments - in play, at least for me - tend to end up being a lot like compelled Fate aspects in that the players land themselves in trouble chasing XP. If you want to do this, I&#39;d tie FP generation to alignment moves and write a move for spending them.</p>
