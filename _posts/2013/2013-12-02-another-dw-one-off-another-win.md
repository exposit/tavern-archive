Another DW one-off, another win! I&#39;m getting the feeling that DW is a near-perfect system for one-offs!<br /><br />This one began with something a little more complex than previous examples:<br /><br />BOOM! The deck of the sky-ship lurches as a huge flaming rock smashes into the hull, your ears ring and you grab for a handhold. A sailor is thrown overboard, falling to his likely doom.<br /><br />Questions:<br />Who is firing at you and why?<br />One of you is a stow-away, why?<br />There&#39;s an additional threat on the attacking force, what is it?<br /><br />The battle lasted about 2 hours and was a perfect introduction to the three players, all of whom were experienced role-players but none had played DW (preferring Shadowrun).

        <p>There are a couple of Shadowrun PbtA hacks floating around out there. One on the apocalypse world forums called &quot;The Sprawl&quot;, though that&#39;s more pure Cyberpunk, and I&#39;ve seen one called &quot;Sixth World&quot; that&#39;s more Shadowrunny.</p>

        <p>That sounds really cool. My players sadly didn&#39;t like answering questions, so unfortunately that aspect of DW didn&#39;t work for us :-(</p>
