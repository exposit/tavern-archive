My Caves of Chaos group is going through the Bloodstone dungeon after another band of players almost destroyed it. <br /><br />This is probably the most entertaining and dynamic dungeon crawl I&#39;ve seen in over 30 years of gaming. <br /><br />In three sessions, there has been several alliances and betrayals, a siege, a honour duel, kraken tentacles, an angelic intervention, an opening chasm, plots, religious conversions, flights, fights, secret doors, ghost librarians, negotiations, an abduction, a magic sacrifice, several mangled limbs, a drowning and a geyser of orc blood.<br /><br />I don&#39;t think I can top this, ever. I&#39;ll have to retire from GMing when it&#39;s over :D

        <p>The Bloodstone Idol I take it?<br />Mate, I&#39;ve played it more times than the &#39;sword&#39; for burning wheel and that&#39;s saying something. :)<br />I love that adventure.</p>

I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s these players, my improved grasp of the World Engine, or all the shit overflowing from the Caves of Chaos. Probably all three, really.</p>
