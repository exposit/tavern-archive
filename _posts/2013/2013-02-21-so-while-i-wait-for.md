So while I wait for my account to activate on the DW Forums I thought I&#39;d post this here.  I&#39;m slowly but surely working to convert the &quot;Lava with a cup of Java&quot; adventure (linked below) Phoenix Comicon adventure because I think it&#39;d be a really great introduction to DW and how it works.  I&#39;ve got most of the monsters done and have a few Fronts but I&#39;m not entirely sure I&#39;m doing it justice.  What kind of fronts would you use for the below adventure if you were using it for an introduction to DW and how much/little information would you include from the original document?
