Ran Dungeonworld last night over skype. Fun was had by all! All 3 of my regular players showed up, so we had Karl the wizard, Ted the rogue, and Astryr the ranger.<br /><br />Last time, they had killed a bunch of bandits; in the lair, hidden in a box in the floor, they found 3 bottles. One was brown glass, one was clear, partly filled with pink powder, and the third was red and gold glass, plainly valuable.<br /><br />The brown glass bottle turned out to contain a very strong emetic, 6 doses if used cautiously for medicinal treatment, or one dose if you want to render someone incapacitated for a few hours, and maybe risk killing them.<br /><br />The pink bottle smells strongly of cherries and oranges; the ranger associates the smell with a childhood remedy for lung disease that once attacked her village (I&#39;m thinking it is either a cure disease or healing potion, once water is added).<br /><br />And the red bottle contains a Genie. Ted is very upset that it won&#39;t LEAVE, giving him the 300+coin bottle to dispose of! The others keep trying to tell him the genie will grant wishes, but he hasn&#39;t decided that to his own satisfaction, yet, and the genie sure isn&#39;t going to say so without a direct question!<br /><br />They had a LOT of fun talking and negotiating with said genie, and next time we play, they are going to travel to Skalde-Hagen to do research on genies and satyrs (a problem still lingering from another session).
