So I&#39;ve been tinkering once more with my Dying Earth hack for Dungeon World. I&#39;d really love to hear what people think of it.<br /><br />Fat stack of Dying Earth playbooks:<br /><a href="https://docs.google.com/file/d/0BzodcvOSM5bDazJ5Ukw0dFFkZTg/" class="ot-anchor">https://docs.google.com/file/d/0BzodcvOSM5bDazJ5Ukw0dFFkZTg/</a><br /><br />Arch-Magician and Sandestin playbooks:<br /><a href="https://docs.google.com/file/d/0BzodcvOSM5bDNzl3dEU4WVJ1U00/" class="ot-anchor">https://docs.google.com/file/d/0BzodcvOSM5bDNzl3dEU4WVJ1U00/</a>

        <p>I&#39;m at work (and busy for once) but will check these out in detail tonight and post feedback.  I love what you&#39;ve done so far.</p>

        <p>Only had time to skim, but a couple of comments so far.  I find the name of the Thug playbook a bit, un-Vancey?  Maybe switch to something like &quot;The Brute&quot;?  Also, the Thug&#39;s &quot;My Way&quot; move uses +CHA to intimidate.  I might use +STR instead.  More feedback when I can read in more detail.  This is really tempting me to run a Dying World game.</p>

        <p>Mm, yeah, the Thug could certainly use a more evocative name. Although, as far as the STR vs CHA thing goes, I like having the choice (and that&#39;s what the &quot;Hulking Brute&quot; background is there for).</p>

        <p>How about these, upvanced names:<br />The Pedagogue (know-it-all)<br />The Toadying Syncophant <br />The Traveling Merchant of Means (Trader)<br />The Gentleman Without Means (Vagrant)<br />The Argumentative Ruffian (Thug)<br />The Innocent  (Gossip)<br />The Naif (Innocent)<br /><br />As for the gossip, he isn&#39;t really innocent, but naming him &#39;Seems to be Innocent&quot; or &quot;Claims to be Innocent&quot; doesn&#39;t really work.</p>

        <p>This has also got me thinking that I really don&#39;t like the name &quot;The Gossip.&quot; But &quot;The Munchausen&quot; doesn&#39;t work for the Dying Earth, and &quot;The Exaggerator&quot; or &quot;The Hyperbolist&quot; just sound silly. &quot;The Fabulist,&quot; perhaps?<br /><br />Or running with Gil&#39;s idea of going all-out Vance-verbose with the playbook names, the Gossip would become &quot;The Teller Of Tall Tales.&quot; (Also, I think &quot;The Gentleman Without Means&quot; and &quot;The Argumentative Ruffian&quot; are both quite lovely. And now I&#39;m imagining The Dying Earth as it might be narrated by Stephen Fry.)</p>

        <p>I don&#39;t know, I kind of like The Hyperbolist :)</p>
