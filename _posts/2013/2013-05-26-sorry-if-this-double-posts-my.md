Sorry if this double-posts-- my phone app hates me.<br /><br />Anyway, a quick question about spellcasting and rotes/cantrips. Do you really need to roll a Cast a Spell move to cast a rote? It seems harsh to get the same complication for &quot;light&quot; as for &quot;contagion&quot; (for example). <br /><br />I may be thinking about this the wrong way, in that a simple light spell, cast in the wrong time/way, can complicate things just as much as infecting someone with leprosy. I guess, for me, it&#39;s that the complications for casting a rote are both likely and frustrating-- a -1 (making it harder to cast another spell), or losing the spell (or the DM complication, which can be excellent in the hands of a creative DM, or not-so-excellent if your DM runs out of ideas).<br /><br />So: Do rotes and cantrips require you to roll the Cast a Spell move?

        <p>yes, they do. If you think it&#39; not <i>interesting,</i> make them work automatically. Mind, you, it&#39;s not about what&#39;s &quot;logic&quot; or &quot;realistic&quot;, it&#39;s about what&#39;s <i>interesting.</i> Casting &quot;light&quot; in a closed dark space undergroud potentially full with dark elves may draw unwelcome attention, regardless of how difficult is to cast it. I don&#39;t know if it makes any sense to you...</p>

        <p>I agree with <span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink" href="https://plus.google.com/103447617849846007337" oid="103447617849846007337">Nikitas Thlimmenos</a></span>. When in doubt, remember to <b>lead with the fiction.</b> It&#39;s so simple, but man if it isn&#39;t easy to forget sometimes.</p>
