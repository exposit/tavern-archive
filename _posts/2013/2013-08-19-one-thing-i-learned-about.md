One thing I learned about Dungeon World last time I GM&#39;ed: Crossbows are awesome loot.<br /><br />First of all, because they are <i>expensive</i>. 35 coins! Second, they are <i>useful</i>; some classes can&#39;t start with a ranged weapon or they have to choose them on the expense of something else.<br /><br />The party started out being attacked by a big log of an ogre and 4 human henchmen. The ogre had a big club and some chainmail, but the humans hard short swords (8 coins each) and crossbows (35 coins each), along with a bundle of arrows (1 coin each).<br /><br />They kept all the arrows, but they sold the 4 swords and two of the crossbows.Â For simplicity, I used a &quot;sell for half&quot; guideline, but they still crammed out 86 coins from looted equipment alone! I rolled random treasure for the ogre, and he yielded another hundred.<br /><br />In essence; suddenly everyone who wanted to now had longswords and shields. Now they&#39;re saving up for plate armor for the paladin and the fighter.<br /><br />Oh, and one thing I figured out during this game; when players search a body, asking if it has anything of value, telling them to roll a d10 while consulting the chart on page 228 will produce a resounding cheer. :)

        <p>All that gear survived the fight?</p>
