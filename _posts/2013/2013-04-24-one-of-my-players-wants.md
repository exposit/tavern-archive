One of my players wants to play a dark elf priest. Any idea for a racial move?

        <p>Animal companion - spider?  Base it off the ranger move.</p>

        <p>Hard to say. What does dark elf mean to you? Shadows? Corrupt? Racial profiling?</p>

        <p>The only <i>real</i> answer to this is to ask him what it <i>means</i> to be a Dark Elf Cleric (I assume you mean cleric).</p>

        <p>A fully Gygaxian dark elf priestess sounds like some sort of a compendium class that features Drider shapeshifting and maybe a special version of Orison that only functions at Places of Power. But I bet you could condense these features into a race specific for a cleric.<br /><br /><b>Dark Elf:</b> You are a child of the spider goddess. Your patron deity always has Petition: Offering. When you seek Divine Guidance by sacrificing something Elven, you may roll + WIS, and on a hit you gain a boon or useful knowledge, you may pick from the list below. On 10+ all apply, on 7-9 pick 2:<br />*Your received wisdom unleashes curses against your aggressors.<br />*Your received wisdom reveals uncomfortable lore relative to your situation.<br />*Your allies aren&#39;t covered with swarms of spiders by your received wisdom.</p>

        <p>Here we&#39;re all assuming that dark elves are, well, dark, evil, living in darkness, worshippers of spiders and matriarchal. Usually, in DW, there isn&#39;t all this assuming: the DM and the player should talk about it, asking and answering questions, and basically create a (possibly new and unexpected) dark elf culture and race.<br />Of course, if for the both of you the &quot;classic&quot; idea of dark elves works good enough, just go for it. But I suggest you take some time to discuss.</p>

        <p>The general consensus seems to be; Spiders should be involved.</p>

Spiders are totemic for Dark Elves. How you read into this totem is totally your call. <br /><br />Personally, I believe that the spider totem is a symbol of misunderstood nature. Dark Elves need to be sinister, even if they are actually complete sweethearts. Thus, my formula would be, Elves + Darkness (eldritch lore, violent rivalry, or literal darkness of the underworld) + Spiders = Dark Elves.</p>

        <p>DArk Elf Cleric/Priest : you can use Spirit Tongue like a Druid would but only with Spiders and other ARachnids.</p>

        <p>Depends.  What are dark elves about in your campaign?  From there, what&#39;re their clerics like that others are not.  Not just what gods they worship but HOW do they worship differently?</p>

        <p>Here&#39;s four possible Dark Elf Cleric racial moves for you:<br /><br />Unraveller<br />Your goddess is evil. Add petition: blood sacrifice. When you petition Her, for each Elven thing you destroy in sacrifice, She will grant you one giant spider.<br /><br />Blood Drinker<br />Your goddess is evil. Add petition: blood sacrifice. Instead of healing others, your spells cause damage. When you harm another creature with these spells, you heal 1d8 damage.<br /><br />Darkling<br />You are a creature of darkness. When you commune you are also granted a special version of Darkness as a rote which only works underground.<br /><br />Terrifyer<br />Your faith is terrifying. Cause Fear is a rote for you.<br /><br />(edit: added names)</p>
