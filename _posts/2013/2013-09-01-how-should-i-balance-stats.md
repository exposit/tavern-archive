How should I balance stats for a new class? I&#39;m tinkering with a ninja class and I&#39;m wondering how many moves should I devote to each stat. It seems to me that most classes focus on 1-2 max stats, notably the Wizard with just INT.<br />My actual writeup of the Ninja is based on WIS/DEX, since Ninjas powers come from their uncanny agility and hard mental training.<br />Should I broaden the stat usage?

        <p>Basic Moves mainly based on two stats are fine I guess. You could always write advanced Moves on other stats to make something diverse or inusual</p>

        <p>I used a wip ninja class I found online, I just changed a couple stats to better represent the way me and my player see a ninja. <br />So our basic move is like:<br /><br />Find Your Center<br />When you spend some time centering yourself, set your Ninjutsu to your Dex.<br /><br />Transformation Technique<br />When you disguise yourself as another person spend 1 Ninjutsu and roll +Wis and then disappear from play.  At any time, you may declare a minor NPC to actually be you. *On a 10+, explain what undercover deed you managed to accomplish while in disguise. *On a 7-9, your disguise was compromised at some point - the GM will tell you the consequences.</p>

        <p>It looks a lot like a Stunt in &quot;Spirit of The Century&quot;, I really like that and generally see nothing wrong in it. Obviously it should encourage the DM to use a lot of small NPCs, when used, but that&#39;s not a problem at all!</p>

        <p>2 main stats for a class is a good focus. You could have a third in advanced moves if you want, but it&#39;s not really necessary. <br /><br />Remember if you are going to have a move that swaps a stat for another on a basic move, give it a good fictional trigger</p>

        <p>No the only stat swap is in two advanced moves :) Thanks!</p>

        <p>You may want a quick focus advanced move, like roll WIS to gain 1d4 focus. On a 7-9, you gain the focus but choose 1: <br />-Gain the WIS debility (forgot the name). <br />-Lose a number of HP equal to twice the Focus gained. <br />-You draw unwanted attention to yourself.</p>

        <p>Nice! ﻿<br /><br />Maybe the hp loss is quite heavy, don&#39;t you think? Those two other options are pretty nice instead.</p>

        <p>it felt like not enough without the doubling. maybe deal your damage to yourself from the strain instead?</p>
