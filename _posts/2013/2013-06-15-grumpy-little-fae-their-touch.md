Grumpy little fae, their touch destroys man-made items, rending armor and shattering weapons, angered by the unnatural presence.

"Lumpkins? Aye is true,they're about in these woods. Ugly gnarled wooden root-men, bout my size. That's why I keep a sack 'o rocks on me mule." The small hobbit yanked on the worn beast's reins. "Wreck any blade and have a cart torn to pieces before you're able to bash their heads in!" He spat. "Hittin' em with a sack filled with rocks seems to work. Sump in' bout them bein' natural, I suppose." Instinct: Destroy man made items
