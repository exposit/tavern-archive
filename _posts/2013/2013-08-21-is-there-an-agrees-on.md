        <p>Substitute race move (or the other way around) doesn&#39;t sound catchy,</p>

        <p>Drive is generally used as a replacement for Alignment, from what I&#39;ve seen.  <br /><br />The most common replacement for Race I&#39;ve seen is Background.</p>

        <p>Background sounds good.</p>

        <p>I like &quot;Background&quot; , but I can&#39;t really comment on what has been put out there by the creative types.</p>

        <p>I&#39;ve also seen Heritage, Past, Training, Specialization, Predilections, and several other terms used.</p>

        <p>Which replacement terms you use depends on what flavour you&#39;re going for, really. &quot;Drive&quot; is the one <span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink" href="https://plus.google.com/105004837996196022135" oid="105004837996196022135">Jacob Randolph</a></span> came up with to replace Alignments, but he uses a different term per class for the Race replacements (the Captain has Background, the Skydancer has Means of Flight, etc.).<br /><br />I&#39;ve taken to using Background as the standardised one, but that does sort of constrain your options for racial moves since they have to be, specifically, character backgrounds (I had some difficulty finding three that fit for the City Thief, and I&#39;m still not 100% happy with them) - you can&#39;t have it be a special skill or a type of expertise, for example (Trustworthy isn&#39;t a background, but Grifter is).<br /><br />Basically, Drives to replace Alignments as a standard is fine, but I think you&#39;re better off with Jacob&#39;s method of finding a separate theme for each class to replace Races with. </p>

        <p>Of course they are seperate things and will be named according to what is best for the class. <br /><br />When we, as a comunity discuss these things however we can use &quot;Background&quot; as an umbrella term for all of them i think. This is what i was looking for.<br /><br />Thank you everyone. </p>

        <p>&quot;Backgrounds&quot; is not the catch-all term for them, it is Aspects. Which is says right in the Inverse World kickstarter, which started them as A Thing, and is what the section talking about them in the book will be labeled. I feel like Background must&#39;ve caught on because The Captain was the first class I previewed from Inverse World, and it was the first time anyone saw a playbook without the Race moves, so. It makes sense it caught on.<br /><br />Each playbook&#39;s Aspect gets named differently to suit the class - Background is the Captain&#39;s Aspect, not the name for all Aspects. Background doesn&#39;t even work for a lot of them, conceptually - a Golem&#39;s material they&#39;re made out of makes no sense being their &quot;background,&quot; for instance. To quote specifically from the Inverse World draft:<br /><br />&quot;      Aspects replace the traditional Dungeon World Race moves. While Race moves give you a move based on what sort of fantasy creature you are, Aspects give you a move based on WHO you are. Whether you are a Pirate Captain or a Merchant Captain is much more important to how you play than whether you are a Goblin Captain or a Merfolk Captain.<br /><br />      Mechanically, Aspects work identically to Race moves - you pick one during character creation, and that choice is locked in for your career. No one can take an Aspect move using a multiclass move - no matter how rough and tumble your Walker is, only The Captain can have the Pirate background. If you have alternate race moves available that you want to use (such as from Number Appearing), you can use them by replacing your Aspect move option. If you think your Troll Survivor&#39;s regeneration move is more important than the nature of the cataclysm he went through, well, that makes sense. Go right ahead.&quot;</p>
