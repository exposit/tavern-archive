Let&#39;s talk about Quest for <a rel="nofollow" class="ot-hashtag" href="https://plus.google.com/s/%23Paladinweek/posts">#Paladinweek</a>. I reckon it&#39;s simultaneously the best move outside of Ritual and criminally underrated (though I&#39;ve not discussed the Paladin here before!). <br /><br />The good:<br />I love that it&#39;s completely in the fiction, even the mechanical effects of the move are fictional boosts (e.g. invulnerability to <i>___</i>). Better yet is the actual vow, which seems to generally say &quot;my god totally wants me to murder this bad guy. I love that. Suddenly the evil dude goes from a campaign front to personally connected to the players via a vendetta, which opens up a whole world of awesome fictional possibilities. <br />The vows afterwards are also damn cool, and really make the Paladin&#39;s character as a holy warrior who behaves in set ways to retain their honour. <br /><br />The still-good-but-not-quite-so-awesome:<br />I&#39;m not actually too keen on the boons. One of them seems significantly better than the others (invulnerability to <i>_</i>) and so is pretty much an auto-pick. The rest are good, but don&#39;t seem to offer that much customisation (aside from &quot;Holy Mark&quot;, which can be interpreted in a lot of ways). I&#39;m stumped for other boons, though! What would you guys go for? Ideally I&#39;d like the Paladin to get some things they can customise a bit more towards their specific god.

        <p>In fairness I did not choose invulnerability the first time I Quested. I went with speaking in any language and unerring direction to the source of the evil.</p>
