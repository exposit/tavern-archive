Having a Dungeon World &quot;Monster Hunter&quot; (not the videogame) campaign might be interesting. Gives you the chance to at least use all these cool and dangerous monsters.

        <p>This idea is something that always appeals to me.  I might be tempted to introduce a lot of Witcher / Rippers / Beast Hunter stuff in there.  i.e. taking parts of the monsters and gaining Moves from them -- in the form of tattoos or elixirs made from their blood, etc.</p>

        <p>Wait. Why <i>not</i> the Capcom video game franchise? It&#39;s pretty much the same thing if your focus is on fighting monsters and making stuff from their useful bits.</p>

        <p>I&#39;ve always thought this would make an awesome game.  The players work for wizard guilds gathering parts for magic spells and rituals or items or a creepy-powerful apothecary. Maybe even anyone who can pay to have the monster in question killed or captured.  I think it would be a blast!</p>
