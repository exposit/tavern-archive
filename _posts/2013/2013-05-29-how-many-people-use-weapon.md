How many people use weapon ranges in their combat fiction?  Can you give me some examples of how you do it?  I keep thinking there&#39;s a lot of fictional fun and mayhem there, but am having some trouble incorporating it.

        <p>I&#39;ve got a knife.  You&#39;ve got a broadsword.  Everything else being equal, how is the fight different for you than it is for me?</p>

        <p>I had an Orc caster who has all the range categories on his elemental attack spew forth like a volcano hitting folks spread out at all sorts of weapon ranges.</p>

        <p>&quot;The pocket-size boys are swarming all over you both, clutching onto your clothes and stabbing with their little knives... Raven, you can&#39;t attack the ones on you with your axe, its range doesn&#39;t include &#39;hand&#39;... So, you&#39;re swinging the axe at the ones crawling all over Morgan... What&#39;s that, a miss?...&quot;</p>

        <p>Right!  So we are dancing, and the interplay there <i>matters</i>.</p>

        <p>I do, but I&#39;m a long time fan of combat sports and have learned what an important aspect of fighting reach truly is. For an insight try having a look at ESPN&#39;s Sport Science segment on that very topic, featuring UFC light heavyweight champion Jon Jones.</p>

Unless he parried my spikey polearm with sword-and-dagger in a cruciform, drove it to the ground, stepped on the end, and put the sword to my neck.<br /><br />Dancing, yeah.</p>

        <p>The fighter got grappled by an undead gnoll.  His signature weapon was a warhammer/pick.  But he had chosen the option to give it an extra range tag and said that it had a buttspike on the bottom of the handle.  So I let him choose to make an attack instead of having to break free from the grapple first.  I wouldn&#39;t have let him do that otherwise.</p>
