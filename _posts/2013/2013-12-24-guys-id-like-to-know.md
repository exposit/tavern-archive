Guys, I&#39;d like to know your opinions about recommending Dungeon World to someone who have never played  RPG neither heard/read anything related. What do you think?

        <p>Yes, do it. DW is easy to pick up and play, simple to learn, and a lot of fun. (Two months ago, one of my now regular players thought D&amp;D was just a cartoon from the 80s. Thanks in no small part to DW, she&#39;s now getting her own set of dice for Christmas.)<br /><br />There&#39;s more advice in the back of the book for pitching games of DW, remember: <a href="http://book.dwgazetteer.com/appendices_teaching.html" class="ot-anchor">http://book.dwgazetteer.com/appendices_teaching.html</a></p>

        <p>I did it. I found it worked quite well as they could draw upon movies or other visual media to describe what they wanted to do. </p>

        <p>I need to clear that the player is going to learn rpg alone, he has no background in any rpg game neither has played before (and yes, he&#39;s a fantasy geek).</p>

        <p>Would somebody experienced be the GM?  If so than yes do it.  If the whole table is new to rpgs...well that is a whole different can of fish, and to be honest, DW is probably the way to go there as well.</p>

        <p>DW is still the game of choice, IMO. Start them off on World of Dungeons if you want to take things easy - tell them &quot;OK, any time you do something risky, you roll 2 dice and add a statistic. I&#39;ll tell you what.&quot; and go from there.<br /><br />I&#39;m assuming you (or someone else with experience) is going to be the GM here. If they want to be GM as well, they&#39;ll need to read the book and see if they like it themselves. (DW is still the game of choice, since the text is free and readily available.)</p>

        <p>My brother-in-law, who had zero role playing experience, came over when we played DW. He jumped in with absolutely no problems. I was really surprised by how accommodating the system was.</p>

        <p>If the player is going to learn the RPG alone, at least Dungeon World has great instructions and examples.</p>

        <p>I&#39;ve taught a few first-time role players. DW is a GREAT way to introduce to the hobby.</p>

        <p>Dungeon World is undoubtedly a better introduction than pretty much anything else in the fantasy game genre. Its not as rules heavy and it doesn&#39;t have as much &quot;RPG logic&quot; that only makes sense to people because they&#39;ve been playing it since they were ten.</p>

        <p>I played Dungeon World with a bunch of 13-year olds who played video games. Doing character sheets took much time - choosing look was easy (pick 1 out of 3 options), but assigning stats was harder (what does it mean that my character is strong?). Sometimes the players tried to avoid consequences from the fiction.<br />But: during a session they learn what does it mean 10+, 7-9 and 6- (but they didn&#39;t position the character in the fiction to use a better stat - or maybe once in an evident situation).<br /><br />I don&#39;t know, what age are your players (and what kind of media they consume), but for younger players I&#39;ll suggest something without killing,  and for older more mundane setting (for example Monsterhearts or even Saga of the Icelanders, if I were to choose from AW hacks).</p>

        <p>well, once it was said (I think by adam) that playing DW with only soft moves equals adventure time. I can easily envision a game with no damage, no killing, just fictional consequences (and should a monster ever go to 0 hp, the player just decides its fate).</p>
