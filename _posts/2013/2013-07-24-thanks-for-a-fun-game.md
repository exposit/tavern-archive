Thanks for a fun game last night, to <span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink" href="https://plus.google.com/110330901807759406775" oid="110330901807759406775">Tim Franzke</a></span>, <span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink" href="https://plus.google.com/100147296818432808203" oid="100147296818432808203">Larry Spiel</a></span>, <span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink" href="https://plus.google.com/106356438763725613551" oid="106356438763725613551">Jonathan Henry</a></span> and <span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink" href="https://plus.google.com/118077910528384239608" oid="118077910528384239608">Cameron Corniuk</a></span>!<br /><br />For everyone else, here is a short overview:<br /><br /><i>Akleus the Cleric of Zeus, Andreas the Thief, Thornelios the Hoplite Fighter and Halek the Ranger, with his wolf companion Murder, is travelling by ship to the city of Pompeji, which was recently destroyed by an eruption of the volcano Vesuvio, to recover an artifact, the Thunderbolt of Zeus.</i><br /><br /><i>Akleus wants to recover it for his temple, and believes everyone else on board has the same agenda. Meanwhile, Thornelios and Andreas is running a con on him to steal and sell it, since Andreas is in a monumental debt and Thornelios has vowed to protect him. Halek seems to be in for the ride, his motives unclear as of yet.</i><br /><br /><i>The entire crew has died mysteriously, so Thornelios is steering the ship by himself, as he is the only one with sailing experience. They hear a beautiful singing voice among huge collection of shipwrecks, and Akleus persuade the others into investigating it.</i><br /><br /><i>It was a trap! The ship runs aground, and siren-harpies emerge, trying to kill the party. After a long battle, the harpies are killed. They search a nearby galleon and finds a small boat they use to get to shore.</i><br /><br /><i>They decide to follow the beach to Pompeji, and comes to the still standing city gates, but as it is dark, the group sees the light of a campfire with huge shadows projected onto the city wall.</i><br /><br /><i>The rest of the party hides while Andreas the Thief sneaks in to check things out. Minotaurs, and two of them! One of them takes of, and Andreas decides to sneak up and poison the tankard the last of them was drinking from. Unfortunately, he was caught in the act, and it bound and gagged him, while muttering words eerily akin to &quot;Fire Titan&quot; and &quot;Sacrifice&quot;.</i><br /><br /><i>The rest of the group grew anxious after a while, and Akleus asked Zeus what they should do. As a sign, a bolt of lightning threw in Andreas direction, so the party hurried towards the campfire. They saw Andreas tied up, and Thornelios charged the minotaur at the fire, assisted by Akleus, while Halek snuck around and started firing at it with his bow. During the fight, a group of small minotaur-like creatures emerged, made from rubble and moss, which significantly complicated matters.</i><br /><br /><i>Halek was slain and Hades came and visited him. He gave him the bargain that if he destroyed the Thunderbolt of Zeus, he would grant him back his life. Halek agreed and returned to the world of the living, unconscious.</i><br /><br />This is where the session ended. Basically, this was set up to be a greek tragedy in all its foreboding glory, since if the quest was succeeded and the Thunderbolt found, friends would turn on friends.<br /><br />I really hope we can continue this game some day, it was a blast :)

        <p>i didn&#39;t really see the greek tragedy angle but it is totally there. </p>

        <p>At most two people will survive, should we find the Thunderbolt. I fear it will be that insane hoplite with his thief friend, and not Akleus... ;)</p>

        <p>Lovely stuff. I particularly liked Hades&#39; bargain and the sense of it setting up disaster to come.</p>

        <p>It was the most obvious to me at the moment. Also inspired by someone elses bargain where Death wanted the guy to steal the Scepter of the Lord of Life. </p>

        <p>Gods messing with each other causing conflict between mortal allies is very Greek tragedy!</p>
