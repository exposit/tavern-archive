I desire to play some DW, anyone tried running it over Hangouts yet? How well does it work out when not in person.

        <p>I would totally be down with playing via hangouts. I would not want to run it, as I have yet to play the game, so that would slow things down.</p>

        <p>I would be up for that. Will have to figure out a schedule.</p>

        <p>I ran a game through a google hangout for New Year&#39;s Eve, and it went great. No problems at all. If you need to share a map or some notes, there is always the Roll20 &quot;app&quot; for Hangouts..</p>

        <p>It works great via hangouts. I&#39;d venture to say that it is more suited to hangouts than many other systems. Mainly because of it&#39;s &quot;theatre of the mind&quot; focus and it&#39;s conversational nature. ie: no tracking rounds or turns, just talk and play!</p>

        <p>/signed.<br />It can help if you use Google Sketchpad for visualizing combat.<br />I just scribble down the &quot;battle layout&quot;. But nothing fancy, because there&#39;s no need for tracking movement and such things.</p>
