During last night&#39;s game I had to invent a new move on the fly. I had not determined the total number of Ratfolk in the sewer section the party was clearing so I didn&#39;t have a good grasp on what sort of treasure they might have. Add to this that they are scavengers with little in the way of objects of true value I determined that the best solution was that the party could find oddments worth 1d4 gold/load. <br /><br />When you dig through the refuse of a nest of scavengers you find oddments worth 1d4 gold per load you are able to take with you. Anything that is left is taken by other scavengers before you can return.

        <p>I love it when a DM/GM makes up new rules.  It gives the group a better feeling of &quot;We&#39;re the only people in the world playing this game right now&quot;, which I think adds to immersion.  I also have a special affection for D4s... The more I read about Dungeon World, the more I feel a massive need to get it and coerce people into playing it with me</p>

        <p>Apparently, the shipping charge from the US to the UK is almost as much as the game...! Still, I got paid this week. Roll on the dungeons!</p>
