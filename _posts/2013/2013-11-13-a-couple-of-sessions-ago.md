A couple of sessions ago, I improvised a magical item as a reward. It&#39;s much like the &#39;glaive&#39; from the movie <i>Krull</i> a huge shuriken-boomerang thing that can slice through walls.  Then I forgot about it and didn&#39;t write any rules, tags, or special moves for it. But now the Fighter tells me he wants to take <i>Blacksmith</i> to merge the glaive&#39;s powers into his gigantic sword. <br /><br />So here&#39;s what I&#39;m thinking: when you attack by throwing your sword, it always comes back(ø). If you trigger <i>Volley</i> with it, on a 7-9 you can choose <i>The sword causes a dangerous amount of collateral damage</i> as a side effect. <br /><br />Thoughts? <br /><br />(ø) Note that I&#39;m not saying <i>when</i>  the sword comes back. I&#39;m expecting some Thor jokes next time ;)

        <p>Looks nice to me. I mean, I would go for it!<br />Does it have any Piercing damages?</p>

        <p>Wow, it escalated quickly ;)<br /> <br />What other properties has his sword ?<br /><br />Here are some complications.<br />+ it doesn&#39;t come back alone<br />+ it causes embarassing collateral damage<br />+ it comes back at the worst moment</p>

        <p>It&#39;s huge and has serrated edges (so it&#39;s the perfect saw, while being messy and forceful). No piercing damage yet.<br /><br />Thanks for the complications ideas. I think most of them will be soft and hard moves deriving from the fiction. I just want Michaël to be able to make even more of a mess when he decides to, while giving me golden opportunities to collapse buildings on top of people.<br /><br />Did I say Apostarius is a vertical city, with levels of levels of rotten wood houses built on top of each other?</p>

        <p>Well, even without knowing the player, huge+messy+forceful+thor effect might indeed mean a lot of collateral damage.<br />Maybe keep the idea in mind to do something like the ranger move for multiple shots later.<br />Instead of using ammo, it might need more time to come back (a longer throw?) or cause more unintened damage. I think he might enjoy this.</p>

        <p>Yeah, I can see group attacks becoming a thing. I already let him do it with HnS providing he accepts taking more damage. That would be the same with Volley : on a 7-9, he would have either harder side effects or have to choose two of them. </p>
