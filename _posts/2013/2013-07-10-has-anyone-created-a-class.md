Has anyone created a class similar to the Geist setting in World of Darkness<br /><br />I&#39;ve been discussing the option of speaking with Ghosts and can&#39;t seem to find one yet.

        <p>I wrote a compendium class that can turn into a ghost and absorb and spend ghost for ghostly effects. Would that help?</p>

        <p>Maybe start with something like... hm. I&#39;m pulling this out of thin air here, so it might need some tweaking.<br /><br />When you try to gain the attention of a ghost to speak with it, roll +WIS. (Or +CHA? Not sure.) On a 10+, things go pretty well. Pick two. On a 7-9, things don&#39;t go quite so smoothly. Pick one. On a 6-, the GM makes a nice hard move and things get rough. (Or something, who knows.)<br /><br />* The ghost&#39;s attention stays firmly on you through the conversation.<br />* The ghost is not immediately angered by the encounter.<br />* The ghost does not need to be convinced of the fact that it is dead.<br /><br />Something like that to start?<br /><br />I know I&#39;ve read a CC that has moves based around moving ghosts on. I&#39;ll see if I can dig it up.</p>

        <p>If I remember correctly, the shaman is all about speaking with the dead. Could easily be interpreted as ghosts.</p>
