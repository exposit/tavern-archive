when you spend a few days working behind the bar at the Ditchwater Cooperative Tavern in the City of Dis, get credit for 3d10 drinks and as much mystery stew as you can stomach, and roll +WIS. *On a 10+, pick 2. *On a 7-9, pick 1.<br /><br />-Make friends with everybody, +1 the next time your Carouse at the Cooperative. <br />-Hear a useful rumour about a job that some other crew failed or passed up.<br />-Grab a good-looking fresh job off the notice board before anybody else can read it (no competition!).

        <p>Cool.  But why +WIS, not +CHA?  I should think making friends and hearing rumours is a charisma-type move.</p>

        <p>With high Charisma and low Wisdom you get a lot of very friendly drunks you tell you stories that may or may not be true. (But probably not.)<br /><br />With high Wisdom and low Charisma you get a bunch of people who don&#39;t like you and don&#39;t realize you&#39;re listening in on their conversations.</p>

        <p>Well, I figured that working behind a bar would take a certain degree of mental fortitude... but CHA works well in the situation, too. </p>
