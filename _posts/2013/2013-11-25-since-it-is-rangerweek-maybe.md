Since it is <a rel="nofollow" class="ot-hashtag" href="https://plus.google.com/s/%23rangerweek/posts">#rangerweek</a>, maybe we can talk about the &quot;Unnatural Ally&quot; move. How have other GMs handled it when the ranger selects this. Does their current pet suddenly mutate, or does it abandon then as they find a new monster? Let me know your thoughts.

        <p>Ask the player! They chose the move :)<br />Hopefully it stems from the fiction at hand.</p>

        <p>Yeah, that&#39;s always good advice, but I&#39;m curious for what has happened at people&#39;s tables. Obviously no right answer, but examples are always fun. I can imagine times where the fiction didn&#39;t lead to it obviously happening.</p>
