A couple of Legend of Zelda inspired magic items. Let me know what you think!<br /><br />The Dungeon Map<br />A blank piece of old parchment, rolled up and bound with simple string. These maps adapt to whichever ruin they are first opened in. Upon unrolling, thin lines of ink appear, giving the size and shape of every room in the dungeon, but none of the details.<br /><br />The Compass<br />A simple blue compass with a red needle that does not point north. When you use a compass for the first time in a new dungeon, roll+Wis.  On a 10+, choose 2. On a 7-9, choose 1. The GM will mark them on your map (it need not be the Dungeon Map).<br />-the location of the most dangerous monster<br />-the location of a notable treasure<br />-the location of an important key

        <p>These items would only work in a dungeon, and only if it is planned out beforehand. So I would never use these items. But I love this idea! What about making other items from LoZ? Megaton hammer? Iron Boots? Fairy Bottle?</p>

        <p>I like it! Remember that the Zelda maps don&#39;t show the hidden rooms, so there are still plenty of places to fill in the gaps. Which also would lead to fun combinations with the compass, making a spot in the map that isn&#39;t in a room.  I can just imagine chuckling evilly at my players freaking out, trying to reach the room.</p>

        <p>You could use this without a planned dungeon. You could just draw the dungeon right there on the spot.</p>

        <p>more over, you just need to update the description from &quot;ruin&quot; to &quot;location&quot; and here we have a fantastic magic item for DW, given its philosophy where everything is a dungeon, even the world itself.</p>

        <p>Yeah that&#39;s awesome.  Never thought of adding some Zelda flavor to my games...  Mine eyes have seen the glory!</p>

        <p>Thanks for all the feedback, everyone. I agree that these can only really be used in a dungeon (which can be defined pretty loosely, like you said <span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink" href="https://plus.google.com/106679386179477817028" oid="106679386179477817028">Alessandro Gianni</a></span>), but if the game follows a Zelda theme you&#39;ll probably end up in dungeons anyway! <span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink" href="https://plus.google.com/116124411286229550721" oid="116124411286229550721">David Schirduan</a></span>, have you got any ideas to adapt some other iconic Zelda items?</p>
