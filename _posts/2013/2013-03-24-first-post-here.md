First post here.  I&#39;ve ran a single session of Dungeon World at this point and me and my group absolutely love it.  One problem though- we are, let&#39;s just say, mature and our eyes suck.  The stock character sheets font size is a pain in the ass.  So I&#39;ve set out to make our own.  I&#39;ve got the format done in InDesign (which is the first time I&#39;ve used it) and have just finished the Thief sheet.  Considering the amount of work that goes into making the individual class pdfs (since you cant set fonts for fields and such in InDesign), I figured I&#39;d post a link to the thief sheet here for critique and input from those more experienced with the game.

        <p>That&#39;s a really good-looking sheet, but doesn&#39;t The Thief get 4 Bonds?  <br />And what about the other classes? ;)</p>

        <p>This is why I posted this here;) Perhaps I&#39;ll move the bonds to the last page where I have a bit more room.<br /><br />Or just remove the lines and make it a multi-line entry area that way it won&#39;t change from class to class.</p>

        <p>There you go!  I hope you make them for all the classes!<br />Or maybe a generic one, at least!  Nowadays, there are so many classes!</p>

        <p>I plan to have a generic one.  Other than that, I&#39;m just going to do the base classes.  Obviously the generic won&#39;t auto calculate the HP or Load, but that isn&#39;t really a big deal.  Now that I think about it, there might be a way to make the generic one able to do that.</p>

        <p>I was thinking something like this on the Bonds (Foxit allows the arrows, of course they could just be drawn after you print it).<br /><br /><a href="https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B28Zz_c9JXdwdnJtZ3pNWDhGOEE/edit?usp=sharing" class="ot-anchor">https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B28Zz_c9JXdwdnJtZ3pNWDhGOEE/edit?usp=sharing</a></p>

        <p>You can do that, it works, but if you want to use the sheet long-term, you should just leave it blank so they can be written in pencil and erased when they change.</p>

        <p>Either option will be available, nothing says you have to put that text in there, I just had it there for example.  They just will be fillable fields.  I&#39;m not a huge fan of the cookie cutter bonds they have on the character sheet, I can see their benefit in one off beer and pretzel games, but for most of what we do they will be largely changed into more appropriate stuff.</p>

        <p>Here is a link to the blank character sheet for critique.  A couple of things to note:<br />1) The HP and Load are auto calculated- the constants used are on a non printing layer- showing and hiding layers can be done with the layer control accessed through the button on the left hand side of both adobe reader and Foxit.<br />2)This is an extended PDF which, in this context, means you have greater control over editing text in the fields.  In adobe reader if you hit Ctl-E it will bring up the text editing controls.  This is useful in the larger fields (Moves, Magic Items, etc...).<br /><br /><a href="https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B28Zz_c9JXdwYU1BSkg2QnVsZUE/edit?usp=sharing" class="ot-anchor">https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B28Zz_c9JXdwYU1BSkg2QnVsZUE/edit?usp=sharing</a></p>
