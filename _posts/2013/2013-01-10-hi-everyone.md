Hi everyone.<br /><br />Sometime ago <span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink" href="https://plus.google.com/113762594640194435357" oid="113762594640194435357">Aleksandr Ermakov</a></span> gave me a link to this discussion (<a href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/comment/400873#Comment_400873" class="ot-anchor">http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/comment/400873#Comment_400873</a>) and mini-hack mentioned there. I was impressed and even had a post (<a href="http://mycampaigns.blogspot.ru/2012/12/blog-post_6356.html" class="ot-anchor">http://mycampaigns.blogspot.ru/2012/12/blog-post_6356.html</a>) in my blog about it (it&#39;s in Russian). It is very short hack (more a custom move probably) so here:<br /><br />When you resist harm, the MC will tell you what injury threatens your life. Roll+number of hit points you&#39;d like to spend. One a hit, choose options. On a 13+, all of them. On a 10+, choose 2. On a 7-9, choose 1.<br />* You can ignore this injury for now, it doesn&#39;t hamper you<br />* You got lucky: the injury&#39;s not as big a deal as it seemed<br />* You maintain your position or advantage, and can react immediately (maybe even take +1forward)<br />On a miss, you suffer the injury in full, right now.<br /><br />I liked it very much and thought about using it in my upcoming DW campaign. Then vsh (its reader handle) mentioned that this hack has a problem - it doesn&#39;t account for armor. Any thoughts about how it can be fixed?

Oh, it's pretty straight-forward. You just, you know, put NPC in the crosshairs and pull the trigger with the PCs as the gun. You make the PCs easy violent heroism seem petty and monstrous. You make t...

        <p>I was seriously thinking about using this hack, but spotted the same issue.<br /><br />You could potentially roll damage, subtract armor and use the end result as a negative modifier. The big issue here is that its a lot more dice rolling and would slow the game down.<br /><br />A simpler possibility, just add armour to the hit points spent. Spending 3 HP whilst in Plate ensures you live.<br /><br />The final possibility is the armour is accounted for - in the fiction. If a dragon bites an unarmoured foe you describe the severed arm. If is bites a man in plate you describe warping metal, and blood running from the groves. Neither sounds pleasant but the armour definitely had impact.</p>

        <p>You could also chunk armor into Light and Heavy; each gives a bonus to the &quot;resist harm&quot; roll.</p>

        <p>There is a bigger issue in that this move doesn&#39;t actually present a choice: <br /><br />Players will always pick <b>You got lucky</b> first because its irrelevant if you are unhampered or in an advantageous position if you are dead.<br /><br />If they get to pick 2 they will always select <b>You got lucky</b> and <b>You can ignore this injury for now</b> because its irrelevant where you are if you cant move.<br /><br />In other words any pretence of choice is actually an illusion - unless the player is planning to go down fighting in which case they might just take that mortal wound so they can keep fighting.</p>

        <p>That&#39;s a really good point. I&#39;d even boil it down to a list of options, and have them choose 3 or 2, like...<br /><br />* You don&#39;t freeze up from the pain.<br />* The GM doesn&#39;t [insert Move here, something like &quot;Take Their Stuff&quot;].<br />* The enemy is locked in combat with you. (maybe not perfect, this would work for situations where you <i>want</i> to tussle)<br />* You recover X of the hitpoints you spent.</p>

At the very least, ignoring the injury is more immediately important than getting lucky. Getting lucky means you don&#39;t have more problems later, ignoring the injuries means you don&#39;t have more problems NOW (while you&#39;ve already got at least one major problem to deal with).<br /><br />Losing your position or advantage could be less important than the other choices depending on how good your position is (if you&#39;re holding a dangerous enemy at bay in a narrow hallway, you REALLY don&#39;t want to lose your footing) and how dangerous the GM wants the game to be (they could push that move pretty hard if they wanted).<br /><br />Really, if you have easy access to healing (like a cleric) around, &quot;getting lucky&quot; could be the LEAST important choice. That just means that after the fight is over, you&#39;re going to need to tend to that wound. Note that it says &quot;the wound isn&#39;t as bad as it looks&quot; not &quot;you don&#39;t die right away&quot;. It would be a pretty brutal interpretation to say &quot;If you don&#39;t chose this option, you&#39;re dead.&quot;</p>

        <p>they might be able to offer 1 point of hp to count as two up to armor? Sounds simple and yet powerful enough.</p>

        <p>vsh that&#39;s me.<br />I actually came up with two variants. Both of them make armor pretty important, giving it more spotlight than it currently has in my games.<br />First is armor giving its bonus to the roll when and only when the fiction dictates.<br />Second is partial success on 6-9 with light armor and 5-9 with heavy.<br />Wanted to playtest them both on Sunday, but we&#39;re swithicng GMs for a while, so I&#39;m not sure about it yet.</p>

Neither option is a no-brainer and I can make either option seem the best or the worst one as a GM.<br /><br />She batters you into retreat, you getting scratch here and a wound there but that only makes you angrier... for now. So what do the others do at that time?<br /><br />Well, okay, you don&#39;t get a sword in your guts, but you&#39;re pushed back and hanging on the cliff now, battle raging over your head, what do you do?<br /><br />You caught her sword&#39;s edge with your open palm. It may be not the smartest thing to do with the sword, but she certainly didn&#39;t anticipate that and is open for a stab. Take +1 forward, what do you do?</p>

        <p>The more I think about it the more I intend to use armor as a bonus for the roll though (as <span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink" href="https://plus.google.com/105808699738403752805" oid="105808699738403752805">Vasiliy Shapovalov</a></span> mentioned) only if fiction justifies it. Like you have the full armor+shield bonus if a goblin stabs you with his spear, but you won&#39;t have your shield if another goblin bites your leg from behind and no armor helps you when they push you from the cliff.</p>

        <p>So did it go further than that with playtesting and all? I&#39;m really keen on adding that move as a basic one when I introduce my players to DW at last.</p>

Almost like old Shadowrun 3rd edition did with splitting dice pools. You had N combat dice you could split any way you wanted to attack and/or defend that turn.</p>
