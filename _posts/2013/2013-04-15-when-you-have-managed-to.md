        <p>I like the concept of this one. I plan to look at it more in depth this evening.</p>

        <p>I think turning a 6- into a 10+ is a bit too powerful. At the very least turn a 6- into a 7-9...<br /><br />I also don&#39;t like this because the 6-&#39;s and 7-9&#39;s are what make this game fun. In fact a game where every roll is 10+ will be very boring. <br /><br />Additionally lets say the DM has hold 3. He uses one of his hold to put you in a spot (he now has hold 2) you roll the soft move and get a 6- you turn it into a 10+ The way it is written there is never a reason for the DM to use the hold. If you want to make this fairer I would say the DM gets to exert a hard move (as hard as they wish) onto the player. Basically you shift your karma to have something slightly better happen now but you are in a lot of trouble later.<br /><br />With those 2 changes I think the base move would be much better.</p>

        <p>A spot doesn&#39;t have to follow into a move. It could just be a choice between 2 hard things. </p>

        <p>like this spot: <br />Dagoliir, you can support Sir Valentine but you have to drop your oil and lantern, taking out another one will eat up a charge of your adventuring gear or you could keep it in hand and drench yourself party in flammable lantern oil.  </p>

        <p>I actually am less concerned with <b>Make Your Own Luck</b> and more with <b>Million to One Chance</b>. With that move, why would a ranger <i>ever</i> choose to shoot their bow <i>without</i> a blindfold?</p>
