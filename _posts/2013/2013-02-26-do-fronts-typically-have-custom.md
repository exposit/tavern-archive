Do Fronts typically have custom moves? For my &quot;Against the Cult of the Reptile God&quot; I&#39;m considering some general moves for the front including &quot;kidnap a village member&quot;. Is this how it&#39;s typically done?

        <p>If it calls for a custom move, make one, but don&#39;t sweat it if the existing moves seem to cover the situation adequately.</p>

        <p>I&#39;d say that if &quot;kidnap a villager&quot; is the move, it belongs on a monster - a cultist, for example, or one of the trogs.  <br /><br />If you want to put together a move that puts bad stuff in the players&#39; control like;  &quot;When you spend a night in the village, roll + WIS.  On a 10+ everything is fine, on a 7-9 either you get attacked or a villager is kidnapped, on a miss, both&quot; you can definitely do that (Don&#39;t use that move, that is a stupid, shitty move that I&#39;m making into an example).<br /><br />It all depends.  Remember, moves need clear, fictional triggers they are performing, but don&#39;t always need dice to hit the table.  &quot;When you stay another night in the village without taking precautions, something of yours is stolen.&quot; is a valid Custom Move for a Front.</p>
