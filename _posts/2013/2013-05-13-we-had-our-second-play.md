We had our second play session last night and got to test out &quot;how DW works with A player missing&quot; (one of the reasons I switched from MHRPG and WFRP was that one of the three players in our group often cannot make it, and too-complex games fall over because the other two players are novices, gaming wise)<br />Short answer: it&#39;s okay.<br /><br />The character driven narrative both benefitted and suffered as the two remaining players got a chance to shine a bit more. Barbazar&#39;s player is more than a little larger than life and his playing style is quite, umm, expressive (he&#39;s banned from playing bards or any other class that sings as he himself will burst into song with zero provocation) and his absence i reckon helped the other players get a bit more into character.<br /><br />It fell to me to shadow-play the character which on top of being DM and GM and notewriting and so on was a bit more of a push than it&#39;s been when we&#39;ve played games like pathfinder and dnd.<br /><br />Still, rooms were cleared, goblins slain, and more of the mystery of the Forest Temple Ruin was uncovered. Again we recorded the session, I&#39;ll link the uploaded files when I&#39;m home and off this bloody phone.

        <p>well kind of. its not as super-easy to work round a no show player as say PF or DnD3e as the game is much more character driven.<br />but its nowhere as tricky to work round as something like, say, WFRP (oh, the cards... the tokens....) or 6D6, or MHRPG....</p>
