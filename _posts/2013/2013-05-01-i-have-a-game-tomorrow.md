I have a game tomorrow and the last 2 sessions have been easy for the players. I&#39;d like to test them a little. Last game I increased the number of opponents and the range (by giving some crossbows) but the next one I&#39;d like to have one mighty opponent. I have no idea how to increase the level of difficulty. I&#39;m from a D&amp;D background where you can simply increase the AC and the damage and you&#39;ll get something...

        <p>Make &#39;em think. Make the environment hurt them. Dwindle their resources. Think dangerous ;)<br /><br />I can&#39;t talk... Not had our first session yet!</p>

        <p>Something big. Something that is dangerous to even get near - something you must defy danger to even try to hit. </p>

        <p>There was a nice Actual Play that involved a fire breathing dragon, somewhere...<br /><br />Here! In Sage&#39;s blog: <a href="http://www.latorra.org/2012/05/15/a-16-hp-dragon/" class="ot-anchor">http://www.latorra.org/2012/05/15/a-16-hp-dragon/</a></p>

        <p>About the &quot;16 HP Dragon&quot; post. I love that stuff, it showcases how a monster isn&#39;t only dangerous because of its stats, though they help.<br /><br />I could take a goblin and give it a cloak of invisibility. It would have the same stats, but invisibility isn&#39;t a mechanical effect, so it doesn&#39;t affect the player&#39;s rolls. But it <i>does</i> affect when their moves are triggered.<br /><br />Look at <b>Hack &amp; Slash</b>. Its trigger is <i>when you attack an enemy in melee</i>. OK, to attack an enemy in melee, you must know where he is. The player will have to do something to even get to attack it. Also, it&#39;s actually a serious threat, even though it only deals d6 damage, because it&#39;ll just use a stab-and-run tactic until either everyone is dead or it is prevented from doing so.<br /><br />It doesn&#39;t have to be big to be mean. It just have to have that <i>fictional advantage</i>. Reach comes to mind. Oh, you want to charge that giant? Well, it tries to pound you with its <i>200 pound mace</i>! What do you do?</p>

Produces the most delightful adventures, that would be <b>very</b> difficult to emulate with other systems run &quot;as-is&quot;.</p>
