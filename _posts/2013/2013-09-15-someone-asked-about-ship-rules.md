Someone asked about ship rules.<br /><br />It so happens mine are in Beta.<br /><br />Please note that the ship fighting rules are dependent on the Mob Fight rules also posted here, because boarding triggers a Mob Fight.<br /><br />Again, help would be appreciated!

        <p>The ship statistics are significantly more complicated than the ones I&#39;ve made for  <a rel="nofollow" class="ot-hashtag" href="https://plus.google.com/s/%23pirateworld/posts">#pirateworld</a>  ! If you&#39;re interested, I went with:<br />Crew Loyalty<br />Ship Damage<br />...and that&#39;s it! Everything else is described fictionally (some with tags). Maneuvers, attacks, boarding actions, evasive actions etc. are just rolled with +loyalty. Ships can have debilities (half the crew eaten by sharks? -1 loyalty ongoing), and to be honest, I find that&#39;s more than enough!<br /><br />There&#39;s a bug or something with your comments, this post has appeared three times! Your phone, maybe?<br /><br />I really like having GM moves available, that&#39;s a nice structure that isn&#39;t too overbearing.<br /><br />I admire how much detail you&#39;ve gone into, but my personal preference is definitely for less complicated things!</p>

        <p>HI James<br /><br />I&#39;ll definitely have a look at yours...  I like the idea of loyalty - a mutiny on the high seas is an excellent threat to any over zealous captain!<br /><br />The statistics are based on DW monsters: Armor, Hitpoints and Damage. Player Characters ships have one extra statistic: Maneuverability. <br /><br />Crew is only important for the Mob Fight move when boarding happens: One has to have a rough idea of the size of opposing mobs. The Mob FIght rules are very experimental at this stage.</p>

        <p>I would go with purely fictional consequences and triggers. Doesn&#39;t require any more rules. Add in some new tags and you are golden.</p>

        <p>I wrote the ship rules specifically for the Sea Dog playbook posted above. </p>
