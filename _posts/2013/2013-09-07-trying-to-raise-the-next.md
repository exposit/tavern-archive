Trying to raise the next generation of gamers right!  Running DW for some boys (ages 9-12) today. Any advice on running DW for kids?  <a rel="nofollow" class="ot-hashtag" href="https://plus.google.com/s/%23kids/posts">#kids</a>   <a rel="nofollow" class="ot-hashtag" href="https://plus.google.com/s/%23advice/posts">#advice</a>

        <p>You&#39;re doing it right. Also, the main thing in any DW <b>definitely</b> applies (maybe even more) to kids: ask questions, build on the answers. <br /><br />Fighter, who did you get your weapon from? Why do they want it back so badly?<br /><br />Ranger, tell us about how you met your animal companion, and who you killed saving its life. <br /><br />Wizard, what is the forbidden thing you did to get kicked out of the magical academy, and was it worth it?</p>

        <p>I keep trying to get my kid to try DW, but she just keeps gnawing on the dice.<br /><br />Anyway, what Joseph said.  Beyond that, just generally focusing on the GM Principles will always lead you in the right direction.</p>

        <p>I think my main concern is that they&#39;ve played a few other games, but those games are of course more &quot;passive&quot; than DW. I&#39;ll need to break them of looking at mechanics and just do what their imagination tells them. I&#39;m hoping that they&#39;ll see if they use their imagination, I&#39;ll reward them by making them seem awesome. </p>

        <p>&quot;[Character name], what do you?&quot; is <b>INCREDIBLY</b> powerful.  It keeps the focus on them, provokes the imagination, demands creativity and action, and frames things as being about the <i>characters</i> not the <i>players</i>.</p>

        <p>Kids have the coolest ideas. You can pretty much rely on them, once the momentum gets going, to co-GM themselves.  Ask loads of questions.  </p>

        <p>A good time was had by all. The only issue was that one of my young players (my son) was a bit TOO enthusiastic. With a lack of turn structure, he wanted to do EVERYTHING. Thus, there was a danger of the more quiet players to get overshadowed. I had to work a bit to make sure everyone got a chance to do stuff. This sometimes frustrated my enthusiastic son because he had so many great ideas of what to do! </p>
