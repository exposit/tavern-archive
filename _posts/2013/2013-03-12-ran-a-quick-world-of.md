Ran a quick World of Planes game on Sunday which went well. We had a quasi-fallen angel, a troll, and a noble-born sharpshooter, just back from a rather unfortunate encounter with the planar god-thing Dave!.<br /><br />Highlights<br /> - Our noble freebooter scum doubling up on jobs by convincing the philosopher-scholar Aristophanes the Cynic that their other jobs were necessary steps on the path to learning the meaning of life, the universe, and everything.<br /> - The Free University of Dis exists in twelve separate colour-coded timestreams in order to facilitate timetabling. Unfortunately, you&#39;re still guaranteed to end up with a clash anyway. And no matter what, it&#39;s never a good idea to take off your watch.<br /> - Hedge-goblins causing havoc in Grundyweed Park.<br /> - The Boiling Oceans of Blood are now the Reasonably Cool River of Blood. The University has rowing on it in the spring. <br /> - The Snout&#39;s Spout in Porcino Parish has the best coffee in Dis, and you&#39;ll be fine as long as you don&#39;t mention bacon.<br /> - Providing security for THE TRANSFORMATION of the University&#39;s Proctor into a daemon-wyrm god-thing turned out to be a reasonably mellow affair, apart from the quasi-fallen angel killing more of the crowd than the ceremony actually did (i.e., more than zero). It might have helped if the Proctor hadn&#39;t been so darn elusive about the nature of THE TRANSFORMATION, which was marketed as a free concert to the citizens of Dis.

        <p>I would say it shaded more to an almost farcical, perhaps Prachettesque tone... which was appreciated by all involved. Still, I&#39;d love to run some more serious Planarchy sometime too...</p>

        <p>There&#39;s a lot of farce in Vance, too, be it noted. :)</p>
