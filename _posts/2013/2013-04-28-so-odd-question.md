So, odd question... but am I the only person having problems getting to the materials on the Something Awful forums?  I&#39;m trying to use my registered username/password, but that&#39;s no good and apparently I have to pay $10.00 to register a new one?  da&#39;fuq?

        <p>Material may have moved, you may be banned, or it&#39;s in the archives (which go back 12 years and cost 5 bucks).</p>

        <p>No, apparently you have to actually have a user account now to even view the forums.  That&#39;s new. </p>

        <p>The paywall goes up every so often to encourage people to sign up, it&#39;ll pass. I thought you meant you had one though!</p>
