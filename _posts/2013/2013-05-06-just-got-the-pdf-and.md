Just got the PDF and waiting on the book. What does it mean for your call? For example the bard move -a port in the storm. Lets say we just started our first game with brand new characters. We get to the first civilization that the players have ever been to as a group, the Village of the Burnished Spell Throne Spire. The village is a small hamlet built upon the ruins surrounding the Spire. (The GM having just made it up on the spot) I am assuming that the bard character can say &quot;ah the burnished spire. I haven&#39;t been here since I first held a sword on that fabled day my brother Ateon was killed by the mad space wizard MU. It looks so different to me now...I can see the spire, but what happened to Slattern Slyph Inn?&quot; Call for the port in a storm move, <br /><br />I can see two courses as GM - what you do you mean that is for when you have been somewhere before? This the first time you have been here you dunce. I&#39;&#39;m the GM here. <br /><br />Or (the way I interpret the rule) - ah yes, the Slattern Slyph. Well it definitely has been burned to the ground, but the heat could have only been magical as the foundations are now a slag of black glass. Next to it  you see a small cavern wagon. A impish looking halfling woman smoking a long pipe and tending an impromptu bar made from a board across two kegs, sees you eyeing it. She looks like the previous owner of the inn, but younger, maybe a relative. She is giving you a hard stare, and motions you over with her pipe what do you do? <br /><br />My narrative kibitzing self would go for the later, but wanted to make sure I understand the intent of the RAW. <br /><br />Thanks and peace -Steve

        <p>The latter, and let them run wild with this.</p>

        <p>Thanks that is what I thought and why this game makes it onto my stingy one shelf for game books.</p>

        <p>There are a couple of things there. Remember narrative is king and, if the GM said: &quot;this hamlet, where you have never been before, etc, etc&quot; then the Bard cannot call for this move, since it makes no sense in the narration.Â <br />If you just forgot about that, then it is fair play and roll for it. Ultimately, rolling with the player&#39;s ideas is always better and more enriching to the story. Also, to turn to them and ask: &quot;This hamlet, you have never visited before, but surely a great Bard like you must have known someone who was here before... what did he said about this place?&quot;<br /><br />Then waive it into the story. It helps immersion a lot.</p>

        <p>+Esteban thanks good clarifications. Some subtly there I didn&#39;t fully appreciate.</p>
