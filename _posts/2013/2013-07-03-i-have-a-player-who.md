I have a player who has a very hard time getting &quot;out of character&quot; to answer questions that his character doesn&#39;t know yet, because (and this is the part that bugs me) I haven&#39;t told him yet.<br /><br />So he has no problem getting out of character to say &quot;Do I know anything about that?&quot; but won&#39;t improv to save his life if I say something like &quot;Soandso, why does this woman want your blood so much?&quot;<br /><br />Any suggestions?

        <p>give him 2 (not so great for his character) options and &quot;or was it something else?&quot; <br /><br />Like <br />&quot;She is the hag that cursed your father and his father and every male of your family or js she the crazy stalker warrior women that want&#39;s to either kill or bed you or something totally different?&quot; </p>

        <p>Put the character in a position where it is make up lie or get the bad Guy chop</p>

        <p>Could it be that he is uncomfortable with that sort of improv?</p>

        <p>I agree with Tim; the player is afraid of &quot;messing up&quot; the game with his inventions, maybe, and needs to be given options to lessen his fear.<br /><br />&quot;This woman wants your blood. She&#39;s shouting something about your father... could she be the lover he abandoned when he married your mother? Or is she someone he cheated with your help when you were 12 and he was running cons with you as distraction?&quot;</p>

        <p>Thank you for the input guys. I am sure it&#39;s the improv he is uncomfortable with. <br /><br />The &quot;options&quot; idea sounds like a great method. I&#39;ll give it a try and see how it goes!</p>
