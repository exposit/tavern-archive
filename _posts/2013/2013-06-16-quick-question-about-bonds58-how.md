Quick question about Bonds:<br /><br />How many can a character take?  Is there a limit, other than reason?<br /><br />I remember seeing a post on here that someone said that you can only have as many bonds as there are bonds listed on the playbook.  Is that the case?  If so, anyone know where that&#39;s detailed?<br /><br />Thanks!

        <p>As many as you have on your sheet (unless you get a move for extra bonds). The ammount of bonds you have is one of the advantages/disadvantages of each class. </p>

        <p>I think that is the case. It&#39;s why the bard has the most open spots. Not sure if its stated or not.</p>

        <p>Ok cool - I didn&#39;t see it in the rules anywhere, so I wasn&#39;t sure.  Honestly it doesn&#39;t matter much - for some reason I&#39;m having a hard time getting my players to use all the bonds on their sheet as it is.  It seems like they&#39;re only taking the more antagonistic bonds.  I&#39;m hoping to rectify that - I really wish the Wizard would take the one about another character playing an important role in things to come.</p>

        <p>in the end of the session move, it explicitly says that you can add a new bond only after having resolved another one first. Since there are no other ways to earn more bonds...</p>

        <p>you can take moves for new bonds. </p>
