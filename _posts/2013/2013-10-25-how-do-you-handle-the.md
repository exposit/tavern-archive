How do you handle the character creation after the first session? Both in the late comer and character death cases.

        <p>1. Level, filling bonds as the character interacts with the old party (or fill them out if there was a timeskip). <br /><br />Take a while to ask questions about the character and let them fill in parts of the world. </p>

        <p>Yeah, as with Tim, so say I.  The beauty of DW is that 1st level characters are not fundamentally &quot;weaker&quot; than higher level characters (and they gain XP quickly to boot), so level is not as important as in other level/class driven games (D&amp;D and Pathfinder, I&#39;m looking at you guys).  So, regardless of what level you start at, it&#39;s easy.</p>

        <p>Link them into the other characters backgrounds or into world elements that everyone is exited about. I don&#39;t have much to go with here, I would need better examples from your game to help you specifically. <br />Sorry.</p>

        <p>What, it&#39;s even easier to build a character totally integrated into the world once you already know how the world is! Just build on what you created!</p>

        <p>If the player has been playing and their old character died or retired, integration to the world should be pretty easy since they know what has gone before. <br /><br />For a new player, It may be easier for their character to be an outsider, someone recently arrived from a new, undefined location so they can have their own fist session growth of their homeland, and help them get up to speed on the established setting as you play.</p>

        <p>Have old players help in explaining the established world to new players.<br /><br />Ask questions that establish how the new char fits into this existing world.</p>

        <p>I would expect that the world integration would be the easiest part, since dw world creation should leave lot of options.<br />The character integration with the party is the part I am unsure about. The characters are supposed to know each other and have worked together in the past. Many will have all bonds used up.<br />I was thinking that the new character&#39;s player and each of the other player should figure out how they met and on what terms they are, before the bonds for the new pc are chosen.<br />Also, did someone play flashbacks with some of the characters to establish their backstory?</p>

        <p>I have done that in D&amp;D so you certainly could with DW if you need to.  For me, just letting the group decide how they know each other is fine, as long as they plan to stick with that if it comes up in the game (which, if reasonably possible, it will).</p>
