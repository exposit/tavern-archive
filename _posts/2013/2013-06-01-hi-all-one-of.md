Hi all - one of the prereqs for even minimal set-up for a DW game is a list of names (if you are like me and can run out quickly). I looked and on the GM sheet there is not a list of names. I have alphabetically pulled all the DW names from the book and the steading names and put them in this file. Working on pretty-ing it up but right now this will do. Note you may want to cross through your player names of their characters so you don&#39;t use. This list comes from the classes plus the others in the back (but tried to eliminate extras). I am also working on the side to pull in some of the star names from Polaris to this list for more exotic sounding names. Peace.

        <p>A trick I&#39;ve used for a lot of my games is having a single column of names, and putting an empty row next to each .  That way the names page becomes your campaign notes, and you just fill in a few details next to the name.  A bit faster when running a game.</p>
