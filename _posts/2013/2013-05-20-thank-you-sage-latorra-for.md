        <p>Keep in mind that these are people asking the following questions 100% seriously:<br /><br />&quot;Did your session contain any of the hallmarks of a storygame? Dramatic, scene-editing by players and GM, alike? Focus on the development of a story in-play mutable by GM and players? Shared worldbuilding? Player-permission required for character death? Are these standards or options in the RPG?&quot;<br /><br />(You see, if your game contains any of those things that most sane people consider good elements, your game is a vile storygame that is trying to corrupt and betray the REAL ROLEPLAYING HOBBY.)</p>

        <p>Yeah, I smiled reading that. It reeks of the &quot;realism is more important than fun&quot; ideology that you unfortunately find in a lot of gaming communities...</p>

        <p>&quot;There&#39;s no initiative system, so everything comes down to whatever a-hole decides to shout the loudest.&quot; I don&#39;t think this is a DW problem. Maybe don&#39;t play with a-holes?<br /><br />Funnily I remember think some of these things before I tried AW. Playing the game with an open mind, or at a bare minimum reading it with one, is the best judge of whether you want to do it again.</p>

These fellows don&#39;t seem to know that.</p>

        <p>No, they don&#39;t <i>care</i>. They are literally the RPG equivalent of people who think it&#39;s wrong to give minorities equal rights because it will lead to the downfall of (rich, white, straight, cis, middle-class) civilisation. I mean, smaller stakes and all, but they&#39;re pretty much a direct parallel.</p>

        <p>Definitely - playing / reading it terms of intent. Then you can judge: Is what this game intents to do interesting for me? AND Is this game well written to achieve this intent for me?<br /><br />What the hell would be the point of a world view of game hate? What real world ill thing could occur because of DW that affects you? Your friends make you try a new game and its not as much fun as you hoped? (These are rhetorical questions: I get why, and I&#39;m just blowing off steam.)<br /><br />It makes me laugh and mad, because I&#39;ve played with people like that who now love AW / DW. Hell maybe I was like this myself. Give it a chance, because what if (just maybe) it is a lot of fun...</p>
