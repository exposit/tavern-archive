Are there any half-orc moves for clerics  around? My player would like to play a grumpy half-orc mystic :)

        <p>Here&#39;s the generic Marauding Horde one I wrote for Number Appearing:<br /><br />Name a character who reminds you most of your kin. When you Aid them or they Aid you and roll a 10+ take +2 instead of +1.<br /><br />You don&#39;t need to over-think this. Just pick a move from any playbook that fits pretty well with the race and crack on with the game.</p>

        <p>Half-orc Shaman move:  Your ancestors are hungry.<br />When you gain Help From Beyond, you have the option to take +1 damage and gain +1 hold.</p>
