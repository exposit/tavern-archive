A new couple of artifacts:<br /><br /><b>The Wing and the Key</b><br /><br />These object are said to come from another dimension and to be nothing more than fragment of colour lost in the flux of time.<br />The Wing is a cape weaved with an iridiscent cloth that changes colour depending on the light, the Key is a diminutive trinket, suitable for a necklace or a bracelet, but so intricately decorated ones cannot hope to really understand its design.<br /><br />The artifacts work in tandem: the bearer of the Wing is able to always know the location of the bearer of the Key, and to teleport in their location with a mere thought.<br />The bearer of the Key is able to know every thought of the bearer of the Wing and automatically succeds with a 10+ in every roll made to Aid them.
