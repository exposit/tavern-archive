I&#39;m sure this has been asked (and answered) before, but my Google-fu is failing me.  What is the reasoning behind the &quot;only one per class in a party&quot; rule?  My friends and I are looking at DW and there may be two players that want to play the same class.  What&#39;s the harm?

        <p>Well, part of it is that if they both play the same class, it takes away from the uniqueness of each of them; you&#39;re no longer THE Wizard, you&#39;re just A Wizard. In addition, you could come up with a story reason (I&#39;ve heard someone talking about how the reason in his game you&#39;re The Fighter is that there&#39;s some archetypal Fighter that&#39;s imbuing you with its energy).</p>

        <p>Three things; heritage from AW, niche protection, and archetype. The last comes from the first which I believe came out of the second. You are not A wizard you are THE wizard. There may be others that call themselves wizards but you are the only one that matters at this point in history.</p>

        <p>That rule applies only to start-up. The reason - PC clas people are <i>rare</i>. Your fighter is The Fighter; there are maybe 6-12 others in the world, and your PC knows half of them, and likely knows <b>of</b> the other half.</p>

        <p>But, if your the GM, do what you want. You bought it, you own it.</p>

        <p>Also, keep in mind, there&#39;s not as many choices for a starting level character as they are in AW or MH. Those two fighters are gonna be <i>pretty</i> close to each other, mechanically speaking.</p>

        <p>Actually, there should be player agreement on this. The GM is definitely NOT welcome to modify the rules on his own, at my table.</p>

        <p>The GM is always modifying the rules. That&#39;s their job. Every single move is a rules-tweak.<br /><br />Speaking of a move:<br /><br /><b>When two players want to play the same class, rock-paper-scissors to see who is what</b> and then give the loser a beer and pizza.</p>

        <p>It takes the guess work out of printing up playbooks for the first session, one of each!</p>

        <p>+Kasper Brohus It sounds like you have this idea of a GM who creates no custom content for their game. Okay, that&#39;s cool and I hope it&#39;s awesome.<br /><br />I would never have fun in that game.</p>

I just refuted that it was the GMs job to modify the rules.<br /><br />As a GM, I&#39;m not within my right to break the rules, just as the players are not allowed to break them either. You can change the rules if you want, but it&#39;s not <i>anyones</i> job to break the rules.<br /><br />Custom content is custom content. You can make all that you want of it, and no one is going to condemn you for it. I&#39;ve made a lot of monsters myself, and a few magic items. None of that is modifying nor breaking the rules?</p>

        <p>Well said.  As a group you can change all you want. As the GM, it&#39;s a big no no.  None of this means you can&#39;t create custom content ofc</p>

        <p>If you wanted to softly get around this it might be worthwhile to look at the improved default playbooks like The Priest and such. I played as a priest in a game with a cleric and we didn&#39;t step on each others toes at all despite the classes being essentially the same concept.</p>
