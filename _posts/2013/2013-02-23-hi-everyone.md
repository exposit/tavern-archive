Hi everyone! I&#39;m sort of lost about the state of the Barbarian class. Does anybody have a link to the latest version?

        <p>The kickstarter update (<a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/sage-kobold/dungeon-world-a-game-with-modern-rules-and-old-sch-0/posts/379022" class="ot-anchor">http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/sage-kobold/dungeon-world-a-game-with-modern-rules-and-old-sch-0/posts/379022</a>) is the most recent version. We have a few small changes we intend to make, but shipping has kept us busy.</p>

        <p>Adding to the that, somewhere in this community it&#39;s been said the d6+d8 move of the Barbarian was modified:<br /><br />When the d6 is greater than the d8, that&#39;s when the GM makes bad stuff happen.</p>
