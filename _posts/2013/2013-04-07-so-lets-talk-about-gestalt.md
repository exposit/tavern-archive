So, lets talk about gestalt characters. In D&amp;D 3.x gestalt multiclassing was meant to enhance characters for smallish parties of one or two heroes, to compensate them for their lack of versatility. Small parties tend to do that.<br /><br />I feel that the moves in DW are meant to give the players a way to <i>take control</i> over the story, in ways fitting to their class concepts. Usually this is done by letting the players roll a &quot;better&quot; stat for the roll, or by giving them more say over the outcome.<br /><br />When you play with a low number of players, like one or two, it is sometimes hard for players to achieve the same amount of leverage, since it&#39;s far more likely that they default to Defy Danger in lack of &quot;better&quot; moves, which actually makes GM&#39;ing harder (more radical improvisation needed).<br /><br />This made me think of the gestalt rules from D&amp;D 3.x. My idea would be something along the following lines:<br />- Everyone picks two different classes, no duplicates.<br />- Each character get the best HP modifier and Damage die from either class.<br />- Each character gets all starting moves from both classes.<br />- On level up, each character gets an advanced move from both classes.<br /><br />I haven&#39;t tried it out, just toying with the idea. Thoughts?

        <p>Too many options to keep track of would be a concern.</p>

        <p>That was my main concern as well. Besides, some combos really look terrifying. Thinking about a Fighter/Ranger, having a possible damage of d10 + 2d4 + 4 and piercing 2 at level 2, through weapon configuration, smart advances and specific companion statline.<br /><br />While stats aren&#39;t everything in DW, such a massive damage at lvl 2 is a bit too much...</p>

        <p>What I was looking for is a way to give a character the utility of two characters, but the raw power of one.<br /><br />Anyone got any ideas?</p>

        <p>Why not let their character choice dictate the fiction as it does in AW?</p>

        <p>If you have a fighter and a thief, then your story is going to be about fighting and thieving.  In war and heist stories, people getting hurt and having to go try and find a doctor are a running theme.  Not having a cleric isn&#39;t a problem because whatever clerics do moves from the character domain to the fiction domain.  This also continue to replay value as the choice of characters produces different types of games.</p>

        <p>DW doesn&#39;t need gestalt classes, because DW doesn&#39;t have mechanical assumptions like D&amp;D has. You don&#39;t need magic items to make the maths scale, nor do you need fixed party roles.<br /><br />I don&#39;t think gestalt classes are a good idea for the reasons you&#39;ve pointed out, and it&#39;s entirely possible to play DW with two players. Worse comes to worst, I&#39;d just let them play multiple characters each.</p>

        <p>Especially because there are classes that are mechanicly stronger (Fighter, Ranger) and classes that are fictionaly stronger (Mage, Paladin) and you can just combine the two for extra oompph.</p>

        <p>I play with my three children (what a fortunate father I am). The elder boys have respectively a warrior and a mage, a cleric and a ranger. My girl has chosen a druid. Bonds add an interesting dimension even for two characters played by the same child.<br />We have a lot of fun !</p>

        <p>I&#39;m a larger fan of the above suggestions, but I thought I&#39;d just share this -- I&#39;m currently playing a fighter w/ wizard spellcasting in a rotating GM game.  I&#39;m missing the ritual move, but I have a pretty vast number of options.<br /><br />If you wanted to do this sort of thing without too much hassle, you could simply encourage people to take classes that have multiclassing opportunities, and start them off at level 2 so they could use them right away.  With this method, you wouldn&#39;t need to introduce any house rules besides starting at level 2.  (The primary advantage of this is you wouldn&#39;t really need to tinker much to get it to feel right.)<br /><br />You could additionally simply start people at level 1 and give them one or more multi-class moves immediately.<br /><br />I dunno.  I also remember the gestalt rules pretty poorly in practice -- they made sense in theory, but in truth they ended up not being very fun in actual play.  I&#39;m not sure that would be true in dungeon world, but I think it might be more prone to make the characters very overwhelming (and not in a fun way.)  But, I&#39;m a big fan of DW w/ one/two players plus a GM as is, so, YMMV!</p>

        <p>Also <span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink" href="https://plus.google.com/113655843289466119184" oid="113655843289466119184">James Myers</a></span>, I think DW works great with one player, far better than any other system I&#39;ve tried. However, the <i>player control</i> is still diminished, unless the vast majority of obstacles the hero faces will be something that can be resolved with his class moves. I comparison to a DW game with more than one player.<br /><br />Just saying.</p>
