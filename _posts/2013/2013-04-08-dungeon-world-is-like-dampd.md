        <p>I totally thought that quote was meant to be a slam against Dungeon World, then I followed the link and was pleasantly surprised. Still seems like awkward praise to me, though.</p>

        <p>It&#39;s basically exactly perfect.</p>

        <p>I have on more than one occasion described DW as &quot;Exactly how I played my never-read-Red-Box back when I was 10&quot;. </p>

        <p>What a compliment! I &lt;ahem&gt; know of another Pathfinder group and they actually email &quot;Loot Summaries&quot; after each session. Where is the high adventure and wild encounters? Oh, it&#39;s in DW.</p>

        <p>Dude, in my Pathfinder group we keep a spreadsheet going in Google docs and graph our acquisition of lewtz over time— then plot it against player deaths!<br /><br />In my DW game, 1st-level players are stealing the lizardman mummies&#39; cursed obsidian blades, threatening vampire kings and robbing the shadows of talking horses. Get the best of both worlds, I say.</p>

        <p>Alas, I have the mind of a 7-year old. In dragon years! Ha ha ha fooled you again, Koebel!</p>
