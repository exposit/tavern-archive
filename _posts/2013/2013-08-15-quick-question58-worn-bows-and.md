Quick question: worn bows and ragged bows have the &quot;near&quot; tag, but not the &quot;far&quot; tag. What does it mean? Are they useful to attack enemies at distance, like a normal bow, or not? Thanks inadvance, I&#39;m a new player ;)

        <p>Far and near are different range tags. Near is the same room. Far is someone you can see at a distance.<br />(I think)</p>

        <p>&quot;Near&quot; means nearby, but out of reach. So both worn and ragged bow are ranged weapons, they just don&#39;t shoot as far as things with the Far tag.</p>

        <p>I think the idea is that they cannot be relied on past that range. So come at me with a sword, and I&#39;ve got about one shot before you&#39;re on me. <br /><br />But remember, fiction first. Does the arrow fly farther than a room away? Probably.<br /><br />Can the ranger, who&#39;s been using a bow since the age of three and has been instructed by the master bowman Whin Shem take one last shot at the evil knight Grennick before he gets over the hill and escapes judgement...I&#39;d say so.</p>

        <p>Check out the tags meaning in the equipment chapter. Anyway, in my games we usually treated near as ranged and far as sniper-ranged.</p>

        <p>from the rules (I don&#39;t have the handbook at hand now, but I remembered there&#39;s github...)<br /><br />Near: It’s useful for attacking if you can see the whites of their eyes.<br />Far: It’s useful for attacking something in shouting distance.</p>
