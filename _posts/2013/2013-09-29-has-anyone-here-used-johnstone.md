Has anyone here used <span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink" href="https://plus.google.com/113864117304127544117" oid="113864117304127544117">Johnstone Metzger</a></span>&#39;s River Knife modules? I&#39;m trying to figure out how the two overland maps relate.

        <p>The overland maps from RK1 Knives in the Dark and RK2 Evil Wizards in a Cave are both situated along the River Knife. The town of Affeldeen from RK1 is presumably upstream of The Tellurine Monastery, and its environs, from RK2.  There&#39;s no direct overlap or intersection of the map, though. At least as far as I know.</p>

        <p>I know that there&#39;s a map of the Knife&#39;s geography somewhere, but I don&#39;t think the maps in the released adventures connect.</p>

        <p>Okay, that&#39;s what I thought, but I wanted to make sure that I wasn&#39;t missing anything. Thanks!</p>
