In my most recent session, the druid was conversing with the fighter about the nature and habits of animals. Based on the discussion, I ended up taking the following notes:<br /><br />- There is a lot of fish politics<br />- Octopuses have some loyalty, but not much<br />- Birds think they are better than everyone, they are dicks and have no loyalty<br /><br />I just felt like that was worth sharing. This is often how my DW sessions go, and I love it.

        <p>Funny story, later in the session the druid turned into a sparrow to go hide an evil magic coin on a cliff face, with the result of a 5 on his shapeshift roll. He shifted, and was approached by a big-ass hawk 300 ft up. The hawk started with &quot;Hey, you! Fucker! You&#39;re in MY sky!&quot;... the talk ended with the druid getting a chunk ripped from his wing, being forced back into human form, and falling from a great height into a ton of trees, breaking an arm, and taking a LOT of damage (he is lucky he lived).</p>

        <p>That&#39;s good stuff ;)<br /><br />EDIT: How did you determine falling damage? I know there is a guide to calculating it based on a situation, but I recall d10 was deadly (iirc) - did you go with that, or did you do something else?</p>

        <p>They need to get involved in some convoluted trout political maneuvering.</p>

        <p>The coin is still hidden on the cliff face, as far as they know...</p>

        <p>And yes, I definitely want to somehow work fish politics into the campaign.</p>
