So far, I&#39;m really liking Dungeon World... but I first checked DW out due to confusing it with 13th Age. The latter got some really glowing reviews on ENWorld, I&#39;m easily confused, and somehow, here I am! Has anyone tried both systems, and have any opinions on their relative strengths and weaknesses? I think I&#39;ll end up trying 13A at some point, but might not need to if DW generally has everything covered in the post-D&amp;D lightweight category.

        <p>13A has some great ideas and DW has some great ideas, I&#39;d rather try them both.</p>

        <p>I&#39;m like that too, loving both systems :)</p>

        <p>Cool! What&#39;s your favorite thing about each one? I know my favorite thing about DW is that the DM doesn&#39;t have to roll anything, he just creates problems!</p>

        <p>In DW I like the Storyteller approach and as a fan of D&amp;D 4e, I like Heinsoo&#39;s ideas and the rule lightness of 13th age. Actually I was supporting 13th age and in drivethroughrpg I stumbled over DW. <br />I liked the reviews so I thought I&#39;ll try it out.<br />Now I&#39;m in a kind of dilemma because my players don&#39;t like changing systems all the time :)<br />I&#39;m afraid they will like DW so much that we won&#39;t play 13th age anymore :P</p>

        <p>Actually, I rather like the idea of having bonds to the Icons in 13th Age.  Could be a great way to run a &quot;pre-built with lots of blanks&quot; world setting.  Couple that with a session of Microscope...  hmm... </p>

        <p>I&#39;ve played lots of DW and only once with 13A.  I loved the &quot;maneuvers&quot; in 13A.  I played a fighter, and every die roll would trigger 2 to 5 maneuvers (including misses) that would effect the flow of battle.  The Escalation Die meant that no battle lasted more than six rounds during the game I playes.<br /><br />13A is what 5th Edition should be, a wonderful blend of 4th and 3rd edtions with some awesome new rules on top.  DW looks a lot like DnD on the surface, but is mechanically a big departure from the rules as written for DnD (&quot;fiction first&quot;).</p>
