Hey there, I&#39;m looking to get on board this train. The system looks so much cleaner than 3e, 5e, 4e, whatever!<br /><br />Noob question for which there doesn&#39;t seem to be a lot of details on the net - is the print book any different from what&#39;s in the SRD book? Also, I read the advice here ( <a href="http://www.dungeon-world.com/category/bonus/tools/" class="ot-anchor">http://www.dungeon-world.com/category/bonus/tools/</a> ) - any other good resources for new groups?<br /><br />I&#39;m going to be doing my best to not bork this the way I screwed up Burning Wheel by running it too much like D&amp;D, rolling for every action instead of for each significant event!

        <p>The print book has different layout, I think, and art. That&#39;s the main difference. I think there are also a few minor edits / typoes that might be fixed in the print book but not the public text.<br /><br />As far as rolling for each action or whatever, it&#39;s really quite simple: the only time you roll is when a move is triggered. The scale/time/whatever of that might vary, but that&#39;s when you roll. Remember that and it should be great. :)</p>
