So, around two years ago, I played DW on a forum with people with whom I&#39;d played other forum games.  And it wasn&#39;t very fun.  Even at the time, with the version that was floating around for Adventurers Guild members, there were tons of people raving about the fun they were having and I didn&#39;t get it.  But I didn&#39;t know if it was the game or PBF or just us, the players.<br /><br />Anyway, last night I played the second session of a game that we started on Saturday and I&#39;m having a hell of a time playing the druid.  And I&#39;m really looking forward to playing more.<br /><br />I&#39;m not exactly <i>taking back</i> things that I wrote about that earlier experience -- it was what it was.  But this current experience is way more fun to think about and now I get it.<br /><br />So thanks Adam and Sage (and Tony) (and Vincent) and the community!

        <p>Say more about the differences, if you please.<br /><br />Was it a different mindset? Different experiences between then and now?  What do you think were the contributing factors that made it click this time that were absent the first time?</p>

        <p>Indeed, highlighting stats pushed some weird, slightly stilted, play.</p>

        <p>Hrm, yeah, I <i>ought</i> to be able to break this down more intelligently.  I don&#39;t remember the play of the game with enough resolution to do that right now.  Since it was a forum game, I can go back to Snail&#39;s Pace and read up and maybe figure some things out.  What I recall most strongly is being kind of disconnected, bored and almost entirely valueless to the party -- nothing I did really worked out.  But I&#39;m not sure what would have lead to that.<br /><br />Marshall&#39;s comments about stat highlighting has reminded me that that was a thing, and also, I think marking xp on failed roll is a VERY good addition to the game.  It single-handedly turns a whiff into a pleasing outcome.</p>

        <p>maybe it was the class? In my experience, classes in DW have a strong impact on how you feel the game. I saw some players saying &quot;it&#39;s a meh game&quot; and then having way more fun with a different class.</p>

        <p>hey <span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink" href="https://plus.google.com/117184575738442924541" oid="117184575738442924541">Christopher Weeks</a></span> I am pretty sure I was in that game with you. I also felt meh about it. The stat highlighting was an issue for me, too. Glad it is gone<br />I&#39;m currently in a PBF of DW using the rules that came out with the KS completion. It is running &quot;better&quot;, but still feels meh-ish. I&#39;m wondering if the pace of a PBF detracts too much from an action-oriented game like DW.</p>

        <p>Rich, yeah, it could be.  Playing across a table feels more dynamic and action-oriented than about any game I&#39;ve played.  It&#39;s pretty awesome.</p>

        <p>Alessandro, maybe...  I&#39;m hesitant to go with that as the primary cause, but it sure might be part of it.  Maybe I&#39;ll play the ranger again to test the theory.</p>
