Someone mentioned that the Band Chimera had a new album out called Corwn of Phantoms. <br /><br />Sounds like a kick ass magic item to me. <br />How many cool ideas can we scrounge together from various metal albums or band names?<br /><br /><br />Places, the names of Dungeons, Magic items?<br />Crown of Phantoms <br />The Crown and the Ring<br />Darkthrone<br />The Last Spire<br /><br />The list goes on forever. <br /><br />What have you got?

        <p>I&#39;m actually working on a Dungeon World supplement based on the works of Rush. It&#39;s a fair bit bigger than a few magic items or fronts, but it&#39;s the same concept.</p>

        <p>Pretty much anything written by Bal Sagoth. There is nothing else like it. Their lyrics are a complex story from beginning to end. All tracks contribute to one big storyline. It doesn&#39;t get much more epic than that considering metal and telling stories.<br /><br />Battlelore writes only about LOTR lore. A lot of songs expand on topics that were lightly covered in the books. Very unique.<br /><br />NightWish often tells stories with a song. They are vast and varied.</p>
