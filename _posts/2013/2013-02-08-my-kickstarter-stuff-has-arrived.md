My Kickstarter stuff has arrived! Funny/awkward story: I used to get everything shipped to my work because my apartment didn&#39;t have a space for packages. I got laid off in August and forgot to update the shipping address with Sage and Adam. I was starting to worry that my DW stuff had gone astray because it hasn&#39;t arrived and seemingly everyone else was opening their boxes. Got a text last night from my old boss saying  a package had arrived for me at the office. Had to go in to pick it up today. Ugh... Anyway, here&#39;s a pic!
