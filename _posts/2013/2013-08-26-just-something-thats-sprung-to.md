        <p>For &quot;Stoke the Inner Flame,&quot; what is the damage of the volley? Is it the standard 1d4 for the Wizard or something else?</p>

        <p>Looks good.<br /><br />Might I suggest:<br />Voice of Flame<br />You are always considered to have leverage over creatures of or closely tied to Elemental Flame for the purpose of the Parley move.</p>

        <p>What stops me from just spamming Stoke of inner fire, generating a lot of hold? Is there any downside to doing that (let&#39;s say i only roll 7-9s)</p>

        <p>Oh also<br /><br />Everything Burns<br />When performing a Ritual you always choose to perform a Rite of Immolation upon yourself or a willing bystander in place of one of your GMs conditions. Your GM will work with you to determine what the Rite entails.<br /><br />Through the Fire and Flames<br />When you take the time to sanctify a fire you may gaze into the flames to see distant lands. You may use this sight to Discern Realities upon any location where a fire currently burns.</p>

        <p>Lots of cool ideas. Stoke the Inner Flame is a bit more haphazard than I&#39;d have liked, as I wanted it to boost fire-based spells... but that would basically limit it to fireball if you&#39;re only using the rulebook. It&#39;s meant to use the class&#39; damage dice, so it gives a means of doing a little damage (or throwing around small bolts of flame for other purposes) without overshadowing the character&#39;s spells. As for the matter of Hold, I had assumed that re-using a move that granted it replaced any you had from the previous use. If that&#39;s not the case - I&#39;ll need to look it up - I&#39;ll make some tweaks.<br /><br />Still, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s too bad for my first attempt at anything for Dungeon World. I&#39;ll look over the feedback and suggestions, clean it up, and post up an updated version in a day or so...</p>

        <p>yeah, preparation moves don&#39;t work well with rolls. Why not something like, &quot;when you bolster up, you also gain 1 ammo, or 3 ammo for prolonged periods&quot;.<br /><br /><br />(well maybe in this case you can have 3 or 6 holds, but you get the point)</p>
