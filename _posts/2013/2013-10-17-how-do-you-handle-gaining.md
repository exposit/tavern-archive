How do you handle gaining social influence in DW? Let&#39;s say you become a prominent member of a guild, organization, or military. Are there moves to reflect the new privileges you gain?<br /><br />If not, this may be a good place for a short (3-4 moves) compendium class.

        <p>Yes they are probarbly the best way. There is a guildlord and tavern owner and academy researcher CC at least made.</p>

        <p>First One is from the kickstarter, the other 2 are made by me. I think there is a warlord in numbers appearing.</p>

        <p>I think I&#39;m going to tweak the Landed Gentry to make my own mini-CC.<br /><br />EDIT: <br /><br />Professional<br />When you rise to a position of prominence in your community, you may choose this move when you level up:<br /><br />[ ] Open For Business<br />You now have a base of operations, such as a guildhall, temple or a shop. Describe it! Add your new establishment to one of the steadings on the map. Choose two benefits:<br /><br />- Safehouse: Your base is either well-hidden or protected by the authorities. No one will bother you when you&#39;re hiding out in there.<br />- Trained Assistants: You have a reliable source of help available for hire. When you Recruit from your organization you cannot get a 6-, treat that as a 7–9.<br />- Business Connections: When you purchase something through your organization take +1 to the Supply roll, and the cost is reduced by 20%.<br />- Rumormill: When you listen to the problems of the people the GM will tell you of at least one opportunity within your home or the areas surrounding it.<br />- Prestige: Your organization is well-known and therefore you are too. Add the tag Personage (you) to your steading.<br />- Social Clout: Your membership entitles you to certain social privileges. Describe it!<br />- Skilled: Your organization has people with exceptional skills, such as blacksmithing or magic. Add the Craft tag to your steading, and access to these artisans is readily available to you.<br />- Library: You have access to a large stockpile of information. When you spend time in research, take +1 forward to your next two Spout Lore moves.<br />- Profitable: Your organization earns a lot of money. When you spend your free time working at your job, gain an additional 2 coins.<br /><br />Working at your business provides you with some steady income. When you would gain preparation from training or practice, you may exchange some or all of the preparation gained for coins. Each preparation traded in gives you coins equal to your highest ability modifier plus the number of Professional moves you have. <br /><br /><br />If you have the move Open For Business, this counts as a class move for you, you can choose it when you level up:<br /><br />[ ] Business Expansion<br />Your organization is growing! Add another benefit to your home. You may take this move multiple times. Each time you do, add a new benefit.<br /><br /><br />( I&#39;m also thinking about some kind of capstone move once the guild gets big enough.)</p>

        <p>Custom Advanced Moves can be given to players in the same way treasure can. If you are a guild leader, then you are a guild leader, you don&#39;t have to &quot;buy&quot; it.<br /><br />Every move you &quot;buy&quot; as a guild leader should be something only a handful of guild leaders can do. If everyone could do it, then you have the move as long as you are a guild leader.<br /><br />If the king places a platoon of Knights under your command, then it would be pretty weird to charge the player an advance to be able to give them orders.<br /><br />Fiction first I say!<br /><br />Your CC has a great fictional trigger in this case, because it only requires you to gain a prominent position in your community. If it was &quot;when you become a guild leader&quot; then it would be kind of stupid because then your <i>were</i> a guild leader even if you didn&#39;t buy the entry move.<br /><br />Your CC smells more like &quot;I now have the power to form an establishment, <i>if I&#39;m willing to invest time and effort into it</i>&quot; where the &quot;investment&quot; is an advanced move. This is great, because it says something about what it means to buy into the CC.</p>

With a CC, you could easily go up to level 15 or so. <br /><br />I wrote this stuff thinking about 1st ed. D&amp;D, where past level 9 the PCs would settle down a bit to form their own strongholds and organizations, though they would still be leveling up.</p>

        <p>There are some moves that imply social understanding or social standing (like the Thief can take moves to be better at using the criminal underworld). But for the most part the games I&#39;ve played in have handed this in fiction. </p>
