Happy holidays everyone!<br /><br />Inspired by <span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink" href="https://plus.google.com/117607363824545671895" oid="117607363824545671895">Stephanie Bryant</a></span>&#39;s Krampus in Dungeon World adventure, I wrote up a little present -- a base class for The Krampus. It&#39;s a sort of mash-up of the Santa and Krampus archetypes, with the starting moves:<br /><br /> * The Naughty List<br /> * Down Through the Chimney<br /> * I Look Good Without a Shirt<br /> * Kidnap Sack<br /> * Snicker Snatch<br /><br />v0.1<br /><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0Bw6SrgW-L3kDckRLTVBwYmpsZGM/edit?usp=sharing" class="ot-anchor">https://drive.google.com/file/d/0Bw6SrgW-L3kDckRLTVBwYmpsZGM/edit?usp=sharing</a>

        <p>Interesting idea, but some thoughts: Someone should always be naughty or nice, how would you be on neither? In snicker snatch, the last choice is -1 to kidnap but where is the kidnap move? Usurper doesn&#39;t quite fit the theme as the other Drive&#39;s; Love the No Toys For You move; Reindeer sleigh move, holy cow, possible 18 rations just for the Reindeer? I see how that&#39;s a powerful move but that&#39;s a lot of rations.<br /><br />Would be a neat class for a Christmas themed game.</p>

        <p><span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink" href="https://plus.google.com/100476170927206311405" oid="100476170927206311405">Damian Jankowski</a></span> Thanks for the feedback! I updated the class sheet some.<br /><br /> * naughty, nice or neither: I thought I&#39;d leave the possibility open for games where there were some supernatural creatures or truly neutral ones that don&#39;t really have a set of morals to break. It&#39;s up the the GM, though, whether they want to offer the neither option.<br /> * kidnap: Good catch.&quot;Kidnap&quot; was the name of the move while I was still roughing it out.<br /> * usurper: Very right. I swapped this one out with &quot;notoriety,&quot; which seems more appropriate and is also a little more in line with the idea of being a fan of the characters.<br /> * 18 rations: I wondered about that, too. My thinking: dungeon rations are 3 coins for 5 uses, so at most using the reindeer would cost you about 5 - 10 coins. &quot;Passage on a tough route&quot; is 10 coins, and &quot;Passage on a dangerous route&quot; is 100 coins, so the 5 - 10 coin cost fits well within those rates, especially considering that there isn&#39;t a limit to where your reindeer can take you.</p>
