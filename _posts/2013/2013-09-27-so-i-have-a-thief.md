So, I have a Thief in my game who is constantly attempting to seduce unwitting men. It is happening enough that I think I need a custom move for it. Here it is so far...<br /><br />When you use the powers of seduction to entice someone who might be interested Roll+CHA. ✴On a 10+ you have the individual enthralled with you. ✴On a 7–9 they are somewhat interested, but chose one of the following:<br /> - ???<br /> - ???<br /> - ???

        <p>- They would like to meet again tomorrow to continue this conversation, but must depart now.<br />- They&#39;re really interested in another member of your group. <br />- They&#39;re entirely willing, but have revealed an unsavoury personal habit or belief.</p>

        <p>Ah, I forgot to mention that the seduction is almost always followed by robbing and/or murdering. So, my Thief, presented with those choices, would easily see that as just as good as a 10+...</p>

        <p>Well, as a straight seduction move I&#39;ll stand by my choices.<br /><br />Be honest when you build a custom move ... you were really looking for:<br /><br />What happens when you try to lure someone into a remote shadowy spot so you can murder and rob them?</p>

        <p>-Success! When you wake up in the morning, your money pouch and family ring are missing.<br />-A bystander is also seduced, leading to a quarrel/fight.<br />-People start talking about you. No more being ignored while in this town.</p>

        <p>What happens when you offer Sex and deliver Violence?<br />Roll CHA+<br />On a 10+ they are taken off guard and are confused, you can quickly rob them and escape or do damage + Backstab.<br />On a 7+ they are not surprised! Choose one:<br />You grab their purse, or an object of value.<br />You don&#39;t leave something important behind.<br />You don&#39;t attract unwanted attention.<br /><br />Thanks to my friend Rob and Apocalypse World for this move, which still assumes the character is more of a robber than a murderer.</p>

        <p>But the truth is, sometimes the seduction is for other reasons... Maybe I need two different custom moves...</p>

        <p>Indeed. The actual Goal is important here. I think I would try to avoid it becoming a series of moves, and ascertain the player&#39;s intent for the character.</p>

        <p>7-9<br /><br />But they are only responding so they can rob or gain an advantage on you<br />But they have a jealous or over protective lover or friend that will find out about this<br />But they are deeply suspicious of ulterior motives, and take precautions</p>

        <p>They have an ulterior motive.<br />They come with baggage attached.<br />They&#39;re vindictive.</p>

        <p>This is the seduce move from Apocalypse World, hope it helps or give you ideas!<br /><br />When you try to seduce or manipulate someone, tell them what you want and roll+hot.<br /><br />For NPCs: on a hit, they ask you to promise something first, and do it if you promise. On a 10+, whether you keep your promise is up to you, later. On a 7–9, they need some concrete assurance right now.<br /><br />For PCs: on a 10+,<br />both. On a 7–9, choose 1:<br />if they do it, they mark experience ƒ ƒ<br />if they refuse, it’s acting under fire ƒ ƒ<br />What they do then is up to them.</p>
