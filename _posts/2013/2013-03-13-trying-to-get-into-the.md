Trying to get into the &quot;moves&quot; :)<br />When a thief wants to pick pockets he uses his tricks of trade move, how would a cleric pick pockets?

        <p>If there&#39;s danger in it - with Defy Danger.</p>

        <p>It depends on the situation.  Since he&#39;s not necessarily triggering a move, the GM can make one.  The GM can say &quot;you get caught&quot; or &quot;the guard hesitates, about to notice you, what do you do?&quot; for example.</p>

        <p>Does this basicly mean : the player describes his intentions, i present some danger and then the player makes his defy danger move? Its really hard to understand. Can anyone give me an example of a cleric trying to pick pockets compared to a thief?</p>

        <p>Defy Danger only triggers if the character is attempting to do something and there&#39;s something in their way - remember: &quot;act despite an imminent threat&quot;.  The Thief triggers their move by saying &quot;I pick his pockets&quot; but the Cleric has no such move, so you have to dig deeper.  Is he asleep?  Is he drunk?  Is he looking the other way?  Are you wearing your armor?  Are you carrying gear?  Is this a thing that is possible for you?  <br /><br />Then the GM needs to decide what move is being triggered - either it&#39;s a GM move here (because the player is looking to the GM to see what happened) or it&#39;s Defy Danger as necessary.  It&#39;s not a move to pick the pockets of someone unconscious, after all.</p>

        <p>All of the variants below are by the rules:<br />-So you try to pick his pockets? Are you trained in that kind of things?<br />-Hell yeah, I&#39;m a cleric of Mask, remember? <br />-All right, the letter is yours, what do you do?<br />-----<br />-So you try to pick his pockets? Are you trained in that kind of things?<br />-I&#39;ve done it a long ago in the orphanage. <br />-Too bad you didn&#39;t practice much, the guards are about to notice you, what do you do?<br />-I continue, trying to look unsuspicious, that&#39;s defy danger with Cha, right?<br />-----<br />-So you try to pick his pockets? Are you trained in that kind of things?<br />-No, but I am desperate.<br />-You manage to pull the letter of the pocket, but your target cries &quot;thief!&quot;. Your reputation is already ruined and with guards running fast towards you your freedom is about to be ruined too. What do you do?</p>

        <p>Multiclass Dabbler, oh right, Clerics don&#39;t have that.<br />Divine Intervention.  It better be important.</p>
