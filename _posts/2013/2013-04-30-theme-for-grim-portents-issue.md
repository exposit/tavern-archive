<b>Theme for Grim Portents issue 3</b><br /><br />Since you have all kindly given me a long list of potential themes, and submissions for GP issue 2 are now closed, I thought that I should release the theme for issue 3 so you can start working on your submissions. <br /><br />Feel free to email me your submission when you&#39;re happy with it. At a later date, I&#39;ll declare when submissions will close. This might be a while, as it&#39;s coming up to university exams. <br /><br />The theme? &#39;The Thaw&#39;. I thought it had a nice symmetry with The Dead of Winter.<br /><br />Of course, you don&#39;t have to write to the theme, and you are welcome to submit something that you have already shared/published elsewhere.
