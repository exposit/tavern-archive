This is an item I made to our Warcraft game. It has some steampunk flavour. Tell me what you guys think about it.<br /><br />ZIPZAP NT-54<br />Clumsy. 2 weight.<br />This apparel, created by the famous Nicko Tesly, a gnome scientist, looks like a mechanic glove and mostly comes in pairs. They are used in the mighy Gnomereggan city to fix gadgets and other mechanical stuffs in the city tunnels.<br /><br />When you try activate it with your engineering knowledge, roll +INT:<br />• 10+: 3 holds.<br />• 7-9: 2 holds and some kind of electromagnetic drawback.<br />• 6-: 1 hold, an electromagnetic drawback and you zap yourself. Roll 1d6 and take a stat Condition while the apparel recharges with your energy.<br /><br />Spend the hold anytime on an electric or magnetic effect at your choice. Be creative!

        <p>You really should leave the 6- effect to the GM</p>

        <p>Well, the magnetic drawback effect persists until the next recharge. What we do is that thais effect can be trigged anytime to add complications</p>

        <p>You could have the same on a 7-9. 6- is for when your fate is unknown, at the hands of the GM. Defining a 6- result makes it way too predictable.</p>
