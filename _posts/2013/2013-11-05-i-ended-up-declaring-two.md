I ended up declaring two major story details in a Dungeon World game last Sunday.<br /><br />So, our party is a Princess, Abha (me) and a Fighter, Hans (a newbie player). I&#39;m lost in the  middle of a desert country and Hans is my loyal bodyguard. We&#39;ve signed a contract with the Archeological Guild (because we need money) to excavate the ancient tomb of a king of an ancient and long dead civilization called the Nowobians.<br /><br />1 -- The GM was somewhat vague about the signs on a set of stone pillars pointing to the tomb, so I decided that there were literally statues of dead kings sitting atop them, pointing the way.<br /><br />2 -- The Nowobians considered doors to be a sacred thing with much power. When you step through a door you are stepping into a new world. The door to a tomb is considered, in Nowobian society, to be a literal gateway to hell. This tomb had a really big door.

        <p>I love this narrative aspect of *World games.  Tell  me what you want; more often than not, you&#39;ll get exactly that.</p>
