Forgive me if this question&#39;s been asked and answered, but I can&#39;t seem to find a conclusive answer anywhere. Regarding the Human racial move for the Wizard (&quot;Choose one cleric spell. You can cast it as if it was a wizard spell.&quot;), I interpret this as effectively adding the spell to your class spell list (with a rote becoming a cantrip), but <b>not</b> automatically inscribing it in your spellbook. In other words, a 1st-level Cleric spell would become available as an option for one of your three selected 1st-level spells at character creation, but would not give you a fourth spell in your spellbook in addition to the three you&#39;d ordinarily get. Similarly, you might select a higher-level Cleric spell and choose to inscribe it later once you reach the necessary level. Most of the discussion I&#39;ve seen online about this has leaned more in the direction of just making this a bonus (fourth) spell known at character creation. Opinions?

        <p>As always, ask your players rather than us. <br />Like &quot;Do you have it in your spellbook? Cool, how did you get it there?&quot;</p>

        <p>In our group we just had it as an additional known spell. The wizard still needs to devote a slot to memorizing it anyway. Besides, Dungeon World doesn&#39;t concern itself too much with balance. The narrative will balance things out, I&#39;ve found.</p>

        <p>Absolutely, I was just curious what the intent was. Obviously I and my players are free to do what we like, regardless.</p>

        <p>My take on the Human Wizard racial move is that the selected cleric spell becomes an additional spell inscribed in the wizard&#39;s spell book. Before you mentioned it, it hadn&#39;t occurred to me that one could select a higher level spell, but the wording seems to allow it. So you could select, for example, the third level cleric spell Animate Dead, which would then be inscribed in your spellbook, ready for the day when you could prepare 3rd level spells.  I guess the net of my take was that &quot;cast it as if it were a wizard spell&quot; seems to imply inscription in a spellbook, and that if it were the other way they would have simply said &quot;add it to the list of wizard class spells.&quot; <br /><br />Maybe <span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink" href="https://plus.google.com/112484087750169360510" oid="112484087750169360510">Adam Koebel</a></span> or <span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink" href="https://plus.google.com/117415966179711277938" oid="117415966179711277938">Sage LaTorra</a></span> will comment on what their original intention was. </p>

        <p>I&#39;d always thought it went in your spellbook, but I&#39;m intrigued it might not!</p>

        <p>By &quot;intrigued&quot; I mean: what if the wizard has to pray for that spell instead, as part of their prepare spells? Or what if that spell is innate, inside them?<br /><br />Intent is that it doesn&#39;t replace any starting spell, but as far as where it lives, I don&#39;t know!</p>

        <p>That&#39;s really cool. Pragmatism and theft from the gods?  Or are all Human Wizards bound to the Goddess of Magic or what?</p>

        <p>I was always a fan of the whole Mystra/Selune/Shar relationship in Forgotten Realms. Mystra is the goddess of Magic, daughter of Selune the goddess of the moon, who is sister to Shar, goddess of darkness. Selune created Mystra as a weapon against Shar, and Mystra created the Weave to regulate mortal use of magic. Shar got jealous of how spellcasters worshipped Mystra, so she created the Shadow Weave to be a dark mirror of the Weave and allow evil spellcasters the chance to worship her in order to advance their powers.<br /><br />But I realize that&#39;s probably too much pre-world building for Dungeon World. :)</p>

        <p>I think that&#39;d fly, especially if the players know FR as well.</p>

        <p>Probably my favorite D&amp;D setting to date-<del>at least the one I&#39;ve played/GMed in the most. But yeah, I totally agree that the whole table should be familiar if it&#39;s going to make it into the fiction. I&#39;m finding that, in another non</del>*World game I&#39;m playing in, that the sheer bloat of the setting, coupled with my lack of having read it as compared to the rest of the group, is hindering my level of engagement.</p>
