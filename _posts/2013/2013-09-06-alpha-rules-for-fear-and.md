        <p>Good stuff.<br /><br />I&#39;m not sure about &quot;Time heals all wounds&quot;. The various mythos games have players breaking down completely and retiring in some manner. Is this a genre difference?</p>

        <p>I think it&#39;s not intended to be a mythos game, but gothic fantasy in the style of that one 2nd edition setting.</p>

        <p>Love this. One thought on scars, in some fiction it is the character who did not break, who managed to stand their ground and do what needed doing that ends up with the worst scar. Maybe their could be an addition to the End of Session move where characters who made Fear based rolls need to make a Post Traumatic move that on a full success gives them a point of Grit to allocate where they will or on a failure, applies a Scar.<br /><br />But nicely done - great job.</p>

I&#39;ll see if I can work something in.<br /><br />I won&#39;t get a chance to play-test this for a few weeks at best. So if anyone has an opportunity and wants to try it out I&#39;d love to hear how it goes.</p>

        <p>Still have to read the whole thing, but the description of Courage strikes me as very similar to one that is give in <i>Sharpe&#39;s Sword</i>:<br /><br />Lord Jack Spears: I suppose they&#39;ll shoot me?<br />Richard Sharpe: I suppose so.<br />Lord Jack Spears: I didn&#39;t do it for the money Richard. Though it would have been damned useful.<br />Richard Sharpe: So why did you do it Jack?<br />Lord Jack Spears: Courage. It&#39;s like the King&#39;s Shilling, Richard. Some soldiers save it, some soldiers spend it all in one day. I told you my life was saved by a French doctor. Well the doctor was Colonel Leroux, and he saved my life simply by virtue of the fact that he stopped torturing me before I died. And I just couldn&#39;t stand it anymore. See I had spent the whole coin of courage. And then he made me sign some papers, betraying my honour, and the honour of a lady I once loved. And I could not let him use that, so I became his spy, ridiculous as this sounds to you Richard.<br /><br />(quote is from IMDb)</p>
