So <span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink" href="https://plus.google.com/110984330451541677014" oid="110984330451541677014">russ nicholson</a></span>Â posted some old Fiend Folio pictures on his blog today. I realised that, in 30 years of gaming and five editions of D&amp;D, I had never seen a <b>Dark Creeper</b> in play. I thought I could remedy to that in tomorrow&#39;s DW game...<br /><br />This is my first fully written monster, feedback welcome.
