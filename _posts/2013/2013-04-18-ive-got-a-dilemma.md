I&#39;ve got a dilemma. So I&#39;m making this DW adventure, and there&#39;s this part where I&#39;ve got the players trapped on an island and the only way off is if they complete these different challenges. One of the challenges is there is this building and each player goes through a different door they end up in an arena, but instead of just them there is also 2 dopplegangers of each Character. They have to get rid of the imposters. In theory this is epic and an interesting plot twist and would work in a movie, but in gamplay it would be too confusing and difficult to handle both for players and GM (since the dopplegangers look, sound, and act just like the players). So I need some help, how should I go about this?, If I don&#39;t figure it out I will have to come up with something else.

        <p>Don&#39;t think too hard on it, your job isn&#39;t to plan out the plot. If you want dopplegangers, just build them and give them the move &quot;not a doppelganger.&quot; On a miss, players do damage as normal but, oops, that&#39;s not the doppelganger after all. Sorry Mouse!  If you don&#39;t bother with maps and just describe what each player sees then it will be the confusing rough and tumble you want it to be.</p>

        <p>If the dopplegangers look, sound, and act just like the players...have the players play their dopplegangers, as well.</p>

        <p>And add a custom move if you need it. Something like: When you attempt to discern a doppelgänger from its &quot;clone&quot; Roll +Bond (or Wis or whatever you think): 10+ Yep you&#39;re sure of it, there&#39;s the imposter; 7-9 you found him but it took some concentration and now you&#39;re exposed; -6 This is impossible! And you haven&#39;t been paying attention to anything else around you while you were studying them!</p>

        <p>Wait, in DW you do not have to prepare any adventure. Only the fronts, and only after the second session.<br />Maybe i misunderstood what did you mean, but in DW you can&#39;t write the entire adventure before playing. The rules of the game will fight you. </p>

        <p>Sure, but if he wants a doppelgänger fight scene, it&#39;s as easy as the next blank spot on the map. No reason he can&#39;t brainstorm cool set pieces ahead of time right?</p>

        <p>Yes, right. But if you&#39;re a longtime player is easy to fall into old habits, I just wanted to reiterate this</p>

        <p>I don&#39;t think there&#39;s anything wrong in writing an entire adventure...just as long as you&#39;re willing to scrap it if the players jump off the page!</p>

        <p>so why write an adventure? if then you have to discard the preparation, is much easier to follow fronts instead of determininate all. </p>

        <p>I think adventures are fine. Look at any number of the &quot;adventures&quot; available for DW and what you see is an adventure ready to be played. I think the important thing is making sure that the adventure is purely a detailed Situation and not a plot.<br /><br />Although, really, Grim Portents are loose plots. The difference is, they&#39;re all on the chopping block and begging to be interfered with and thwarted by the players.</p>

        <p>You write an adventure if your players aren&#39;t pushing the story. Not every player likes the idea of collaborative storytelling...some of them just want to be entertained!</p>

        <p>I respectfully disagree. I think DW is flexible enough to operate within a wide spectrum of styles. From a complete blank map to a map with some blanks. Truth be told, I&#39;m sure some folks could plug the system straight into any old D&amp;D module and have a lot of fun. Take a look at Jason Morningstar&#39;s Slave Pit Adventure. It&#39;s a set piece. But not fun and not DW? No way.</p>

        <p>There are huge differences between that type of adventure and adventures where almost everything is already determined, like D&amp;D adventures.<br /><br />Is there a way to play DW: following the rules. which is also the easiest way. <br />Start first session with no preparation; write fronts before the second session and so on. You do not have to decide that the PC have to go to that island because it serves the story. DW not work that way.<br /><br />if you want you can use adventures like Jason Morningstar&#39;s adventure, but even in that case the actions of the characters have a huge echo. In the Adventures like D&amp;D was almost impossible go out of the trail. </p>

        <p>Instead of calling this an adventure why not call it an Adventure Front?  That solves everything.</p>

        <p>Ok I&#39;m very sorry my post got some people into a heated Discussion/argument, I didn&#39;t tend for that. Thanks very much for people&#39;s input I think I&#39;ve got the handle on how to make it work.<br /><br /> I do have the Front&#39;s made up, it&#39;s not an all  laid out adventure (when I said adventure I didn&#39;t quite mean &quot;Adventure&quot;). Although last time I did do that and it ran smoothly and my players loved it. But this time I just wanted to make it free flowing like it should be for DW and have the players decide on what to do.<br /><br /> Depending on what they choose they might not even get to the island, it&#39;s just out there if they happen to come upon it. They&#39;ve got the control. they could either go down road 1, 2, or 3. whichever road they go, they will encounter something.<br /><br /> With the island they have to do the challenges whether they like it or not cause they can&#39;t get off the island if they don&#39;t. (the island is surrounded by a powerful magic barrier, did I forget to mention that.) With the island it&#39;s just encounter after encounter.<br /><br /> And I think any rpg or games in general should be entertaining, cause if not then the players are not interested.</p>

        <p>You&#39;re certainly right in spirit but I see no reason to play hardball on the issue. Imagine session 1, while characters are being made, the question asked by the GM is, &quot;what were you looking for when you became stranded on an unknown island?&quot;<br /><br />Where&#39;s the problem?</p>

        <p>I love the custom move mechanic for this situation - that combined with some good fiction will be a lot of fun.  I know most players when in that situation in a &quot;normal&quot; table top, will spend a long time asking for details before choosing who their opponent is. </p>

        <p>Yuo could get the players to play their doppleganger as well, once there is only one of each character left, the person that killed the dead characters rolls +bond for the dead character.<br /><br />On a 10+, they killed the fake. On a 7-9, they took out the original, but they can be saved. On a miss, they killed the wrong one!</p>
