I&#39;m running a one-on-one duet game. My PC wants someone to come along and help her out on her journey. Any thoughts on whether I should model the companion like a normal hireling, or should I stat them out as a full character since there is a lack of other party members?

        <p>Don&#39;t make it a full character. The game is about them, not about the awesome friend and them. </p>

        <p>If you want to make a Hireling that&#39;s a bit more unique/ involved, I&#39;ve released a change to the Hireling rules:<br /><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lbyD-qx8Oyzmg3v_qc0VQjFbzt6hwhEkcArP_-O_tFk/edit?usp=sharing" class="ot-anchor">https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lbyD-qx8Oyzmg3v_qc0VQjFbzt6hwhEkcArP_-O_tFk/edit?usp=sharing</a><br /><br />Still very much an NPC, but they have custom moves, damage and can take Injuries!</p>

        <p>Obviously you should run your game on Hangouts and invite other players. ;)<br /></p>

        <p>Give them the Animal Companion and Command moves for free, and model their friend with it? I don&#39;t think you even need to convert anything, aside from adding &quot;humanoid&quot; to the list of species (presuming the friend is humanoid).</p>

        <p>Thanks everyone! Those are good ideas to follow. I just need to get a better with describing how in the fiction the companion is acting independently, and not just leaving it to a simple bonus to damage or armor!</p>
