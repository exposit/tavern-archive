Has anybody been using my (VERY unfinished) Princess class? If so, what&#39;s your experience with it? Have you seen any issues or highlights with it?

        <p>Wow that font is really pretty! Sorry this is gonna be kinda long<br />•The World is Made of...!<br />just an aesthetic note, you can put the tags into 2-3 columns and save a bit of space<br />•&quot;Pass up a chance to redeem yourself or to go home.&quot;<br />This is dependant more on the GM to give you opportunities to go home or redeem yourself? The other two are great and much more player action oriented. Maybe &quot;Solve a problem without resorting to your royal name&quot;?<br />• 6 bonds is the same as the Bard; one of its class defining aspects. However this does seem like a really social oriented class with a lot of bond based moves, so I&#39;m on the fence about this...<br />• The &quot;Silk robes (1 weight)&quot; option seems rather obsolete considering the Looks options. Maybe consider Antitoxins or Poultice &amp; Herbs?<br />• Nemesis seems like a really fun concept!  Can I suggest adding the tags <i>Wrathful</i>, <i>Chancellor</i> and <i>Faery</i>? <br />• &quot;Love is a Battle…&quot; mechanically this move is great, fiction wise… well it has potential  get into uncomfortable territory if people RP it in a certain way. I know if someone used this move on me personally, I&#39;d probably ask them to stop : /<br />• Influential - You should probably outright state their cost. Like &quot;they now have the cost: Admiration of the princess&quot; for example.<br />• Well connected is very powerful, I think you should have to roll for it, and on a miss, the GM gets to tell you how horrible that adventure went ;)<br />• I think the princess should have an advanced move to do with Carouse, it seems like a very regal special move ;3c<br />• A move wear you disguise yourself as a pauper or the opposite gender would be awesome too<br />Thats all I can think of for now just looking at the sheet!</p>

        <p>Thanks! Replying to each of these individually...<br /><br />• The World is Made of...!<br />Oh, I had considered that but then the verbiage of the starting moves would fill considerably less space. But I could probably fill that space with the Nemesis move anyway.<br />• &quot;Pass up a chance to redeem yourself or to go home.&quot;<br />This was my worry too, but there are a few different alignment moves out there with similar conditions. I&#39;m not sure if it needs changing, but I&#39;ve been thinking on it.<br />• 6 bonds<br />I did model the amount of bonds off of the Bard. I don&#39;t see this as too much of a problem though.<br />• Silk Robes<br />Hm. This is true.<br />• Yes, I hear you. Thanks for speaking up about this. I&#39;ll definitely include an extra note about consent and how the move should be used and all that.<br />• Influential<br />Good idea.<br />• Well Connected<br />Oooh, that is evil. I like that. I am stealing it. :P<br />• Carouse and Princess &amp; the Pauper<br />I am stealing these too.</p>

        <p>Party Girl<br />When you join in the festivities and somebody rolls Carouse, Roll +CHA. On a 10+ you&#39;re the life of the party, whoever is rolling Carouse carries one forward to the Carouse roll. On a 7-9 you partied too hard, in addition to the aid to Carouse take -1 ongoing until your hangover subsides.</p>

        <p>A few things:<br /><br />-With the unicorn move I would have it say something about naming the unicorn then picking its aspects from the list. Tying names to mechanics may reenforce people feeling like they don&#39;t have much say over its flavor.<br /><br />- I would also remove dungeon rations from the defenses list and add armor. Princesses can wear armor too! I would add the potions in with adventuring gear below.<br /><br />-Personally I would make it a prince / princess class, but that&#39;s just me.</p>

The Princess is meant to invoke the likes of Princess Bubblegum, Dorothy Gale, and Nia Teppelin.<br /><br />I see your point on armor, though her load is not enough to bear it. 5 +STR in a class where none of the non-multiclass moves leverage STR isn&#39;t likely to work out well with anything especially heavy in their starting gear.</p>

        <p>I gotcha. Not trying to start a weird gender equality thing, just saying that a lot of the moves work for males, too :)<br /><br />I plan on offering this up for my Dungeon Planet game when it gets more polished. I&#39;ll also have some more critiques now that I&#39;m home and not having to use my phone.<br /><br />I think maybe giving her a light option would be OK, something worth 1 armor at least. While I&#39;ve never seen this movie, I thought of this when I thought of a princess in armor:<br /><br /><a href="http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ1NDA0MTk5OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTM4NDMwNw@@._V1._SX509_SY755_.jpg" class="ot-anchor">http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ1NDA0MTk5OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTM4NDMwNw@@._V1._SX509_SY755_.jpg</a></p>

        <p>Another idea, you can make the silk robes:<br />silkrobes/bandages (3 uses, 1 weight) </p>

        <p>How&#39;s the class coming along? I&#39;d love to see it get polished up because I think it&#39;s a great idea. I&#39;ll be running it to test it out as soon as I can.</p>
