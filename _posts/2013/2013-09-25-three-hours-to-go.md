        <p>I may have missed it it was discussed, but where do you find most of the Public Domain art you use for works?</p>

        <p>Oh man, all over. There&#39;s scans and photos of stuff all over the internet, Wikimedia Commons has lots of stuff from more well-known artists, lots of people scan stuff they like. There&#39;s pdfs of old books on the Gutenberg Project website or whatever it is. I have a pile of old books with engravings in them (buying a better scanner is on my to-do list, actually), and other stuff from my dad&#39;s library. Lots of libraries also carry art books with dead dudes stuffs.<br /><br />It takes a lot of research. Fine art painters are easier to track down than illustrators because Art History. Publishing outside of the US also helps, because US copyright laws are batshit crazy.</p>
