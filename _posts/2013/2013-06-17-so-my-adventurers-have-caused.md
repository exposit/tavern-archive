So, my adventurers have caused a riot in a city and then fled. And I anticipate this coming up again (that&#39;s just how we roll). I made this custom move for updating the steading after a riot... let me know if you got any thoughts...<br /><br />When a steading breaks out into riots it usually suffers. What happens depends on the difference between the steading’s defense and the steading’s population (consider the population at +1 for a town and +2 for a city). If the defenses are greater than the population, the steading defenders easily quell the riots with no real harm to the people or the steading. If the defenses are equal to or less than the population, chose a number of the following equal to one plus the difference:<br />-population as people, mostly rioters, are hurt and killed in the violence<br />-population as inhabitants flee the steading during the riot and in the aftermath<br />-defenses as guards and soldiers fight hard and lose men in the quelling<br />-prosperity as the steading’s structures is badly damaged<br />-prosperity as the steading’s shops and buildings are looted in the chaos<br />Lawless tag added as the city does not fully recovers from the riotous mentality<br />Other positive tag lost as the riots destroy infrastructure and drive out inhabitants

        <p>If you want to be a bit more in-depth, consider if the steading&#39;s usual defenders have cause to join in the rioting (thereby lowering its effective defense rating)</p>

        <p>Good idea... though I was trying to keep it as in-depth as the existing moves for updating a steading (which I have already failed, I think)...</p>
