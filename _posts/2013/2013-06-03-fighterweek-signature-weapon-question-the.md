 <a rel="nofollow" class="ot-hashtag" href="https://plus.google.com/s/%23FighterWeek/posts">#FighterWeek</a>  Signature Weapon Question <br /><br />The Fighter says this about her Signature Weapon. Since narrative truth is a thing in DW, especially in the first session, how do you deal with this?<br /> <br />&quot;The dragon sword, a perfectly made katana with a dragonhead as a hilt. Legend says that if you can unlock the secrets of the blade you can use the dragon to throw fire at your enemies.&quot; <br /><br />You could do this by just adding the Reach range to the weapon but that wouldn&#39;t really be throwing fire. At least you are missing the tag (is this a problem?) and what move would that be? <br /><i>That</i> beeing the following example: <br /><br />&quot;The orc charges you with his two sabres ready to slash you in an X-Cut&quot; <br />&quot;I channel the power of my blade and point the hilt at him, the mouth opens and it spews fire at him in a blast. just like a young dragon would&quot;

        <p>I feel like that would be Volley or perhaps Defy Danger+...hmm, I don&#39;t know.</p>

        <p>custom move probably. <br /><br />Improved Weapon says<br />Choose one extra enhancement for your signature weapon.<br /><br />It doesn&#39;t really say you need to choose from the original list... <br />So saying &quot;i choose the dragon breath enhancement&quot; might work. Depends on how leanient the GM is... </p>

        <p>Fair enough. I&#39;d never really thought of it like that, not taking it from the original list.</p>

        <p>Well, your original post reads &quot;...if you can unlock the secrets of the blade...&quot;. This implies that the character has not yet unlocked said secrets. I would make it a custom advanced move, maybe:<br /><br />When you call on the power of the Dragon Blade to hurl fire at your enemies, roll +DEX: On a 10, choose 2. On a 7-9, choose 1:<br />- You hit your intended target for 1d8 damage and set it on fire.<br />- Your fire doesn&#39;t go out of control.</p>

This sounds like a blade that comes with it&#39;s own &quot;Golden Opportunity&quot; built right in.<br />&quot;The Dragon Tome says that to unlock the full power of the blade you must train with the Battle Maidens of Gon-nepe Kai.&quot;</p>

Win-win all around.</p>

        <p>I smell something like a compendium class, only with more moves gained by doing stuff and with fewer by spending advances. The whole concept of unlocking a special weapon can help drive a whole campaign.</p>

        <p>I say spend time playing out the unlocking of the secrets before giving them a custom move.</p>
