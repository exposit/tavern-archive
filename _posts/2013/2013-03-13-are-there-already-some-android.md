Are there already some Android apps to improve DW game? :] I haven&#39;t actually used my phone to aid me (well, only to record games), but as I recall from DnD games - keeping track of initiative and HP is sometimes cumbersome.

        <p>This is great! I came across Fiction Idea Generator which is nice to get idea for new plots. I wish a scenario generator like from old DnD DM books was available or some random dungeon stuff.</p>

        <p>DW doesn&#39;t have initiative.  You do track HP and XP but you will also have certain temporary variables that arise from specific moves (holds).  You might find that a pile of counters works better than a digital tool for these, piling them on your character sheet and returning them to the pile as you spend them.</p>

        <p>I use a Iphone app called RanDoo but there are many others out there like it. It allows you to make custom lists and then randomize them. I primarily use it for  Instincts and Character question to help launch those on the fly and first session DW games. It has been awesome helpful when players get stuck and I want to add a little meat I just ask them a random open ended question. </p>
