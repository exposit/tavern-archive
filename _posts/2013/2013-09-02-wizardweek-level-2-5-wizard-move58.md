 <a rel="nofollow" class="ot-hashtag" href="https://plus.google.com/s/%23WizardWeek/posts">#WizardWeek</a>   <br /><b>Level 2-5 Wizard Move:</b><br /><br /><b>Hedge Magic</b><br /><br />As long as you have a spell prepared you can pull a bit of the magic, of the spell, through the ether. Describe your desired effect. <i>For instance, pulling a spark to start a campfire from a prepared Fireball spell.</i> If the GM feels that your asking too much, they can let you make the move anyway, but with a small complication, or make you make the <b>Cast a Spell</b> move as normal.<br /><br />(Thanks to <span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink" href="https://plus.google.com/113847025671240258531" oid="113847025671240258531">Adrian Thoen</a></span> for helping me make this sound less crazy that it initially did. Though, he could probably still help me make it more awesome... <b>coughcough</b>) lol<br /><br />(Edit: For <span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink" href="https://plus.google.com/110330901807759406775" oid="110330901807759406775">Tim Franzke</a></span> )<br /><b>Level 2-5 Wizard Move:</b><br /><br /><b>Hedge Magic</b><br />When you <b>pull a small portion of a spell you have prepared thought the ether</b>, describe your desired effect and roll+INT.<br /><br /><b>On a 10+</b>, The spell fragment bores through your soul and happens as described.<br /><br /><b>On a 7-9</b>, the don&#39;t grab the right pieces of the spell. The effect is slightly different than you described. Until you can get your bearing, you are stunned, and choose one.<br />  -You draw unwelcome attention or put yourself in a spot. The GM will tell you how.<br />  -The spell disturbs the fabric of reality as it is cast—take -1 ongoing to cast a spell until the next time you Prepare Spells.<br /><br /><b>On a 6-</b>, you didn&#39;t quite manage to grab a <i>small</i> piece of the spell. The whole spell burns through you. Make the <b>Cast a Spell</b> move. Take the effects you were trying to replicate with the spell, and replace them with the full spell. <i>For instance, you&#39;re trying to ignite a small flame inside a chimney, but instead you cast </i><b><i>Fireball</i></b><i> AT the house. Now you need to put out the fire before it spreads and does any more damage.</i>

        <p>clarification: From all of the Wizard mechanics we know that casting a spell is dangerous and there is always the chance of something going wrong. That&#39;s why i lobbied for a version that has some risk accociated with it to have no &quot;easy and safe&quot; magic in the game. </p>

        <p>I like that a lot! On the 6-, you could alternatively make the spell affect the Wizard instead as it backfires.</p>

And, like this?<br /><b>On a 6-</b>, you didn&#39;t quite manage to grab a <i>small</i> piece of the spell. The whole spell bores through you... and just stops. The spell affects you in a way that you were trying to make it affect the world. You must <b>Defy the Danger</b> of the spell now boring it&#39;s way through your soul, and into your physical body. <i>For instance, you&#39;re trying to start a campfire by pulling a piece of </i><b><i>Fireball</i></b><i> through the ether, but pull the whole spell through instead. It burns through your soul, then your body. You feel your blood begin to boil. Roll+Con to </i><b><i>Defy Danger</i></b><i> as you blood becomes inimic to your body.</i> If your roll was odd, you forget the spell. You cannot cast the spell until you prepare it again.<br /><br /><span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink" href="https://plus.google.com/115610991532630554135" oid="115610991532630554135">Matthew Everhart</a></span>, Thanks! =)</p>

        <p>My friend&#39;s suggestion: on a 6-, choose 1.<br />* Nothing happens, but you lose the spell.<br />* You keep the spell, but you also cast it.</p>

        <p>Sure, but you don&#39;t want to discourage the move&#39;s use too much.</p>

        <p>To be honest, after writing it up, I think I like it better that way than the first one I wrote. <b>shrugs</b> Also, I don&#39;t think it would be any more discouraging than your friend&#39;s suggestion. In my experience, players like letting the moves snowball, not to mention rolling more dice. Letting them roll to see whether they keep the spell or not, or whether they can defy the danger of the spell, makes it more interesting for them than choosing.<br /><br />If you and you friend may find the chose more interesting than a roll, and I was GMing for you, I&#39;d let you take it the move with the 6- your friend suggested. The move was just written from the assumption of what players, in the general sense, enjoy. (i.e. Tim wasn&#39;t the only reason I wrote up the move the way I did.) </p>
