Hey, anyone has some ideas for an underwater dungeon? I&#39;m looking for ideas about features, enviroment or theme to explore. <br /><br />During the last session the characters were navigating The Dark Mirror Sea -stormy, dark (really?!), and the time flows differently there: one entire day can pass in a few seconds) on board of a ship leaded by a the cursed Captain Janus.<br /><br />The session ended when they spotted a small rocky island in the middle of the open sea, surrounded by huge monolithic rocks that look like fangs. In the middle of the island there&#39;s an entrance that I&#39;ve imagined kind like a well made of coral-stone, that descend into the the deep darkness.<br /><br />There&#39;s more than a chance that they will explore the dungeon. <br />I&#39;v made (in this very moment) a quick sketch draw to give you a better idea (I apologize for the draw, it&#39;s not one of my main skills...).<br /><br />Any idea?
