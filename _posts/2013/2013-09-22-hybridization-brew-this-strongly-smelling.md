<b>Hybridization Brew</b><br /><br />This strongly smelling potion needs a little work to be useful: you have to marinade a freshly harvested body part in it. The essence of the creature infuses the brew and, when you drink it, you get to use two of its moves. At the GM&#39;s option,your appearance may change drastically for the duration of the effect (from a whole day to a few minutes, depending on the powers gained).<br /><br />200 coins (fresh, no bits inside), 0 weight.<br /><br />When found, a brew is often infused with the essence of a giant spider, a golden eagle, or a wood elf.<br /><br /><i>Inspired by Jonathan Walton&#39;s Planarch Codex</i>
