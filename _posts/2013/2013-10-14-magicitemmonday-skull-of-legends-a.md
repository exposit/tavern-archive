<a rel="nofollow" class="ot-hashtag" href="https://plus.google.com/s/%23MagicItemMonday/posts">#MagicItemMonday</a><br /><br />Skull of Legends<br />A fine-boned elven skull carved and fitted so as to be worn as a helmet.  When misidentified, appears to be the skull of some legendary leader and a token of good luck.  While bearing the Skull, <b>when you take the life of someone who has mocked you or belittled you</b>, mark experience.  <b>When you make grandiose claims to an NPC about your own abilities</b>, roll+CHA.  On a hit, you can use your claims as leverage when parleying.  On a 10+, take +1forward too.  On a miss, you are nothing and everyone knows it.  Take -1ongoing until you prove yourself.<br /><br />Thoughts on improvement?  In possession of a Lawful Paladin.

        <p>New version:<br /><br /><b>Skull of Legends</b><br />A fine-boned elven skull carved and fitted so as to be worn as a helmet.  When misidentified, appears to be the skull of some legendary leader and a token of good luck.  While bearing the Skull:  <b>When someone mocks or belittles you</b>, roll+WIS.  On a 10+, hold 3.  On a 7-9, hold 1.  Spend your hold one for one and shout something awful to take +1 against their foul tongue.  On a miss,  nothing is more important than humbling the person who despoiled your reputation; deal half damage to everyone but them until you end them or make them apologize.  <b>When you take the life of someone who has mocked you or belittled you</b>, mark experience.  <b>When you make grandiose claims to an NPC about your greatness</b>, roll+CHA.  On a hit, you can use your claims as leverage when parleying.  On a 10+, take +1forward too.  On a miss, you are nothing and everyone knows it.  Take -1ongoing until you prove yourself.</p>
