Still new to the whole thing.  Found this on page 177:<br />&quot;The one thing you absolutely can’t bring to the table is a planned storyline or plot. You don’t know the heroes or the world before you sit down to play so planning anything concrete is just going to frustrate you. It also conflicts with your agenda: play to find out what happens.&quot;<br /><br />That&#39;s just <b>*****</b> <a rel="nofollow" class="ot-hashtag" href="https://plus.google.com/s/%23awesome/posts">#awesome</a>

        <p>Yeah! I just <i>love</i> dungeon world for that. My absolute favourite is when someone ends up creating a crazy Big Bad Guy, and your crew figure out a way to find and stop them in some ridiculously awesome fashion, rather than drudging through Dungeons 1-5 on a slow grind upwards.</p>

        <p>Yeah, the best DW games I&#39;ve run have been with absolutely 0 prep. Some of them actually turned into campaigns; and, even then, you can plan fronts, but they usually always end up changing. </p>

        <p>Yeah, and it doesn&#39;t stop you daydreaming about a gazillion cool scenes or monsters or locations that you are jazzed about to inflict on the players when handed a golden opportunity!</p>
