So we&#39;re two sessions into our Hangouts game and its working crazy well. My only problem with DW so far is that, man, it&#39;s really enabling the lazy GM in me. I&#39;m already at the point where I&#39;m not really even considering monster moves or GM moves at all. I barely even consider the wispy few numbers I have for monsters. Everything is running about 90% off of description.<br /><br />The primary DW aspects that are really driving play are: the die mechanic (yes, yes but, or anything but status quo) and &quot;be a fan&quot;.

        <p>I&#39;m going the same route.Â  I&#39;m trying to force myself to be better about adhering to the game as written specifically to shake myself out of ruts I&#39;ve been traveling so long that I no longer see them.</p>

        <p>I could see this being an issue that gm&#39;s have to guard against. It can easily devolve into roll 2d6 and I will tell you what happens. The moves and the dungeon moves especially help. One idea is to keep the GM sheet printed in front of you, put a check mark next to each move when you use it, your moves still need to work with the fiction but there may be more than one that will work. Also occasionally twist it around - ask another player what they think will happen on a move, especially if that player is being quite.</p>

        <p>I really don&#39;t see much trouble with it, I was just commenting on how it&#39;s performing. I&#39;d say we&#39;re still playing pretty much as written. Fortunately it&#39;s pretty easy to play as written without even giving much thought to it.<br /><br />And though I&#39;m not putting specific thought into the moves, I honestly can&#39;t think of anything I would do or say as a GM that&#39;s not going to fall under one of the many Moves at my disposal.</p>

        <p>And to be clear, we&#39;re still triggering player moves as appropriate and following through on them. They just all sort of fall under the &quot;die mechanic&quot; I mentioned above.</p>
