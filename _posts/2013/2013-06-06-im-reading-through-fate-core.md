I&#39;m reading through Fate Core right now, and I was like &quot;hey they have a list of skills?&quot; and was then put down a little because I generally think skill lists are <i>restrictive</i>. <br /><br />Then I saw Fate Accelerated Edition, in which the skills are replaced by the six stats Careful, Clever, Flashy, Forceful, Quick and Sneaky.<br /><br />The core system only support four general types of actions; Create Advantage, Overcome, Attack and Defend. I can&#39;t really see how this system would play much <i>differently</i> than any *World game, except for the system being more &quot;generic&quot;.<br /><br />Thoughts?

        <p>PbtA in general doesn&#39;t come with fate points /bennies of any kind</p>

        <p>In what way does that differ from the principle &quot;ask questions and use the answer&quot;?</p>

        <p>The questions are to the characters and their experience and knowledge. It also means you have to actively do that as a GM. In fate you can just state something out of your characters knowledge or experience and make it true if you pay for it. That&#39;s really different.</p>

        <p>To be honest I already know that. But I deem the difference is a rather philosophical one. If you play it &quot;right&quot; then your players create the gaming world in both games. I think the difference is that in Fate you need to &quot;power&quot; this with fatepoints whereas in Dungeonworld this stems from the GM principles and is something you are entitled to be capable of as a player.</p>

        <p>I think it&#39;s a big difference whether you can only state things from inside your character but that&#39;s just me.</p>

        <p>Next thing: Compels feel very differently then missed moves. Both drive the story into a &quot;negative&quot; direction but with compels there is a lot more tabletalk and meta discussion.</p>

        <p>By the way, there doesn&#39;t need to be meta talk or out of character manipulation in Fate... everything can be done entirely in character with 1 simple change:  <a href="https://plus.google.com/110110374841646652137/posts/62DKt3TTtPi" class="ot-anchor">https://plus.google.com/110110374841646652137/posts/62DKt3TTtPi</a></p>

        <p>I was reading FAE and making the same comparison. I think the real difference between the games is the tone and how the mechanics reinforce it in play. <br /><br />In AW you can fail, succeed with complications, or succeed. Other mechanics (putting NPCs in the crosshairs, etc) point those results in a grim direction. <br /><br />In Fate, you can fail, tie (which often seems like a mild success in context), succeed, or succeed with style- and then you can modify results with Fate points. The scale is shifted heavily toward winning, which fits the themes of the game.</p>

A lot of the choices you have to make on a partial success are often directed at the player, not the character.<br /><br />When <i>Discerning Realities</i> for example, I have a hard time seeing how it is the <i>character</i> choosing the questions.</p>

        <p>Yes, of course, address the characters. But that doesn&#39;t mean that everything is the character&#39;s <i>decision</i>.<br /><br />The player makes the choice, we see the effects through the character. In the fiction, the character would not often face the choice.</p>

        <p>Really, do you? ;-) You are totally right here, for adressing the character not the player is one of the great storytelling-related assets of DW. But the creative power of world-building lies within the player not the character. The character is just a fictional inhabitant of the fictional world which the players and the GM create while playing the game (for real).</p>

        <p>Because it isn&#39;t the character that decides whether or not he learns the answer to &quot;what is about to happen&quot; or &quot;what here is valuable to me&quot;. It is the player. The answer is then given to the player, as it is perceived by the character.</p>

        <p>Yes, but when you then roll that 10+ you get two additional questions. These are sometimes (but not always) hard to justify as a &quot;character choice&quot;.</p>

Is she always on the lookout for a gold and money? Or fearful and prepared?&quot; etc.<br /><br />There are a few points in DW where the players get to make choices about the world, beyond their character, without the GM&#39;s invitations (Cleric&#39;s deity) but there aren&#39;t many. Fate on the other hand has fate points that allow this on a pretty regular basis.<br /><br />My general impression is that Fate is more aimed at promoting the elements of a story, whereas DW/AW is more aimed at creating a totally loaded situation from which story may form.</p>

I still think it&#39;s more of a &quot;player choice&quot; than a &quot;character choice&quot; though. It&#39;s not like the character is presented with a list of questions and is asked to pick three. Unless your game is really, really weird :)</p>

You could probably hide in them. It wouldn&#39;t get you out, but it might buy some times while the patrol comes through.&quot;</p>

        <p>I&#39;ve played and run both Spirit of the Century (Fate powered) and Dungeon World. They certainly feel different in play.  (It&#39;s possible Fate Core significantly changes things; I haven&#39;t had a chance to read it yet.)<br /><br />Fate is really assuming the more traditional idea that the GM shows up with a completed world.  Sure, players can create or change parts of the world with mechanics, but the decision to do so falls on the players.  In practice it&#39;s used for relatively small things and almost uniformly to provide the PCs with an advantage. There is also world creation during character creation, but it stops there. As a GM you take the world created during creation and build, largely on your own, from there.  This is the traditional &quot;GM creates, players discover&quot; model.<br /><br />Dungeon World wants me to &quot;leave blanks&quot; and &quot;ask questions and use the answers.&quot;  As the GM I&#39;m pushing for player creation, forcing them into it.  Answers frequently, maybe even usually, lead to putting the PCs into a disadvantage. And while I create a fair amount as a GM, I&#39;m frequently surprised by the elements added to the campaign.</p>
