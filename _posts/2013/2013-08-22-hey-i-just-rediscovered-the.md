Hey, I just rediscovered the second <b>World of Dungeons</b> hack that I was working on a while ago. This is a Star Trek game based on WoDu and the Microlite game <b>Where No Man Has Gone Before</b><br /><br />Has four species, some really simple ship mechanics, and isn&#39;t completely done or formatted. But I think its pretty cool, and its certainly playable for those interested.<br /><br />Shout out to <span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink" href="https://plus.google.com/111694100408744715863" oid="111694100408744715863">Jonathan Walton</a></span>, his quick and dirty dungeon rules from Planarch Codex get a mention in the text as my preferred method of detailing a deadly, dilapidated space hulk.
