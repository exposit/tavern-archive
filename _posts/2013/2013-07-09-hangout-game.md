Hangout game! And guess what: first the wizard failed her roll to cast invisibility on the thief, making him permanently invisibile; then the cleric failed to cast cure light wounds on him, making the thief also incorporeal. He exploited this status in wonderful ways for a session and a half, then the wizard, after having gathered the right ingredients, ritualized a cure. Now the thief is totally eligible for some compendium class! We&#39;re thinking more of a ghostly/spiritic path than a classic phantom ninja&#39;s one. Is there anything out there we can build on? Someone with good ideas to share with us?

        <p>This is more about being a disembodied spirit or a ghost, but feel free to plunder it for ideas. It&#39;s from a full supplement I&#39;m working on where you get to go to afterlives ad have adventures about dead things and the spirit realm.<br /><br />The Ethereal<br /><br />When you have lost or abandoned your physical body, the next time you level up you may take the following move instead of a move from your class:<br /><br /><br />Ephemereal<br />You do not have a physical body. You can pass through physical matter, including people, but you cannot pick up physical objects.<br /><br />When you have taken the above move, you may take any of the following moves instead of a move from your class when you level up:<br /><br />Nine Tenths<br />When you attempt to possess the sleeping or unconscious body of someone or something, roll+Wis. *On a 10+, You gain total control of the body. *On a 7-9, you have to regularly struggle with your host’s consciousness to maintain control.<br /><br />Poltergeist<br />When you attempt to move an object with your strong emotions, roll+Wis. *On a 10+, choose 1. *On a 7-9, choose 2:<br />You make a terrible mess.<br />Someone’s put in danger.<br />You leave ectoplasmic residue behind.<br />You break something.<br /><br />What Dreams May Come<br />When you touch the minds of those grieving for their departed loved ones, roll+Wis. *On a 10+, choose 1 now, and hold 1 for later. *On a 7-9, choose 1. *On a miss, the GM chooses one. Spend hold, 1 for 1, on the following:<br />You drive them into a vengeful fervor.<br />You bring them peace and acceptance.<br />You destroy their will to live.<br /></p>

        <p>The Ethereal Presence<br />When you lose your grip on the material world, become ethereal for some time and get back to your original form , the next time you level up you may choose to gain this move:<br />⃞Phase Change<br />When you try to become one with the air and lose your material body, roll. On a 10+ ok, you did it. On a 7-9 the GM will offer you two options between:<br />•  You can be seen when you move<br />•  Your presence chills the air, and animals are inconfortable near you<br />•  You can come back when you want.<br />Normally, when you&#39;re ethereal you can&#39;t physically interact with the world., You can always come back with some rest or after a full day.<br /><br />If you have Phase Change, these count as <br />class moves for you; you can choose from them when <br />you level up:<br />⃞Glitch<br />When you rest you get 1 hold and lose any hold you already had. Spend that hold when you take damage to temporary phase out and in again in the material world (and negate the damage).<br />⃞...<br />⃞...<br />⃞...<br /><br />ok, i have to get back to work. i&#39;ll finish later :)<br /><br />PS: I&#39;m the cleric :) <a href="http://www.warehouse23.com/img/full/SJG1416.jpg" class="ot-anchor">http://www.warehouse23.com/img/full/SJG1416.jpg</a></p>

        <p>Looks pretty good so far <span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink" href="https://plus.google.com/115711932728406353724" oid="115711932728406353724">Daniele Frizzi</a></span> !<br /><br />Recommendation for phase change: modify the third option, at the moment it&#39;s choosing between two bad things and one good thing. It&#39;s a pretty easy fix, change it to &quot;you can&#39;t control when you become corporeal again.&quot;</p>
