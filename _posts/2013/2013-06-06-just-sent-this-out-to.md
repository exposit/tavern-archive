Just sent this out to my friends to get them psyched for our first DW game tonight. Thought it might be inspirational:<br /><br />&quot;There is something you guys can do to prepare for tonight, but don&#39;t worry; it&#39;s nothing big:<br /><br />Think of your favorite action scenes from fantasy movies or books. Harken back to your days as an eight-year-old, when the only thing standing between you and adventure was your imagination. Fill your mind with as many exciting encounters as you can. Recall the villains that you love to hate, and brainstorm about the beasts of legend that you have always wanted to slay. Envision musty tombs, dank dungeons, and epic avenues of adventure. Finally, imagine the untold riches, the secret knowledge, and the heroic glory that await you in the deep places of the earth.<br /><br />Do that, and you&#39;re prepared to play Dungeon World.&quot;<br /><br />We&#39;re mostly used to DnD, so I&#39;m really trying to sell DW to them.

        <p>I think DW sells itself!<br /><br />However, if anyone is being stubborn, remember that on the playbooks, the names, looks etc.  are <i>suggestions</i> for new players.  If they don&#39;t like them, they can fill in their own.  (This has evidently caused some issues in the re-education process.)</p>
