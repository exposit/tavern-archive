Hi, this is the monster I&#39;ve made. If you got any criticisms or opinions, please write. I&#39;ve also made the drawing (half finished right now). Hope someone will use it. Thanks.<br /><br /><a href="https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B2aqCnT4I_LiLWgtQ25NeV92bW8/edit?usp=sharing" class="ot-anchor">https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B2aqCnT4I_LiLWgtQ25NeV92bW8/edit?usp=sharing</a>

        <p>I really like the concept! Typically, a monster deals the same amount of damage whether they punch you, bite you, or throw you into a wall.<br /><br />For the moves, what about:<br />- Sense when someone&#39;s broken their webs<br />- Spin massive webs<br />- Poison someone<br /><br />For the custom move, I&#39;d word it as a &quot;you don&#39;t&quot; sort of thing. Here&#39;s how I&#39;d reword it:<br />When you <b>free yourself from the web of a spidermonkey</b>, roll+STR. On a 10+, choose two. On a 7-9, choose one.<br />- You don&#39;t get tangled up in the webs, taking -1 Forward.<br />- The spidermonkey isn&#39;t alerted to your presence.<br />- You don&#39;t have to leave something behind to escape.<br /><br />For the poison, it&#39;s the same as the Thief poison Oil of Tagit. Is this intentional? If not, then perhaps:<br />The target&#39;s muscles freeze up over the next minute, eventually paralyzing them.</p>
