How do people feel about Letting It Ride, as per the rule in Burning Wheel? Especially when there&#39;s no obvious threat?<br /><br />Let&#39;s say the party has finished a major battle and withdrawn a short ways to a safe place to camp. Everyone&#39;s low on HP, so the Bard uses Arcane art to start healing people. It&#39;s a lot of work, and will take several rolls to complete the job. How do you handle this? There&#39;s no pressure on the group right now, so do you hand wave it and let the Bard heal everyone up for free? What could happen on a 7-9?

        <p><i>How do you handle this?</i><br /><br />The way I DM, I really want the players to be picking up the dice.  Every time they do, it&#39;s a chance they&#39;ll roll 6- and give me a chance to make a move.<br /><br />Moves aren&#39;t always about threats.  Say the safe space is at an inn: perhaps a drunk barbarian wants to join in the singing and keeps everyone up all night, or perhaps she offers them money to sing at her wedding tomorrow. Or maybe there isn&#39;t a lot of magical healing in this place and the Bard&#39;s obvious magic draws attention not from vicious monsters or exuberant barbarians but instead from a gang of orphans who need healing. <br /><br />These moves are inspired by <i>Show a downside to their class, race, or equipment</i> or <i>Offer an opportunity, with or without cost</i>.<br /><br /><i>Tell them the requirements or consequences and ask</i> is a great move to  escalate a situation and test exactly how badly someone wants something.  When making a move in response to a missed Arcane Art, you could tell the bard &quot;Sorry, your voice is ratched tonight; you&#39;re going to have to assemble a choir or a drum circle and make a heck of a lot more noise in order to get your healing done.  What do you do?&quot;<br /><br /><i>What could happen on a 7-9?</i><br /><br />The move says &quot;On a 7-9, your spell still works,but you draw unwanted attention.&quot;  This is Dungeon World.  Danger lurks everywhere!  No place should be truly safe.<br /><br />Also, not sure how this is a Let It Ride situation.  Let It Ride is about making every roll final and consequential; DW&#39;s philosophy is a bit different.  Every roll is consequential, but not necessarily final.</p>

        <p>What they are doing is making camp. There is not let it ride in Dungeon World. It&#39;s a dangerous and fantastic place and its not your job as GM to say someone is safe now. Play to find out.</p>

        <p>And there is always pressure on the group. Even if it is offscreen (think of all your principles)</p>

The underlying principle of the Apocalypse Engine (not sure whether it&#39;s written as-is in DW) is <i>If you do it, do it</i>. So, if the move happens in fiction, do it mechanically.</p>

        <p>And yes. When they sit down to heal their wounds they are making camp. You can describe the healing as the bard doing it but it&#39;s still the make camp move. </p>

If they&#39;re stopping and resting -- yes! It is making camp! I agree!<br /><br />But! You can&#39;t describe it as bard magic and say its just &quot;making camp.&quot; <b>To do it, do it</b> and <b>if you do it, do it</b>! If it&#39;s described as bard healing, you have to roll it and risk badness happening. Can&#39;t separate the triggers from the rolls.</p>

        <p>Let It Ride stands diametrically opposed to the core trigger system of Dungeon World. Don&#39;t use it.<br /><br />That said, you can, as the GM, always aggressively push forward and skip time. You have that power.<br /><br />&quot;So, about six hours later, you&#39;re all healed up and standing at the gates of Gothalla...&quot;<br /><br />That&#39;s just making moves and following principles. In this case, you&#39;re embracing the fantastic (by ignoring the mundane) and offering an opportunity (without cost) for further adventure.</p>

        <p>Yep. What Adam said. Let it Ride is awesome and useful for the way BW does things (and both Adam and I are huge fans of BW and related games), but it doesn&#39;t really work with Dungeon World. Using it will tend to quickly get odd.</p>

        <p>You&#39;re explicitly allowed to keep trying to do something - if you&#39;re succeeding over and over without adversity and there&#39;s no pending danger, the GM should jump ahead.  Get to the good stuff.<br /><br />If there is a chance of danger, every roll to recover hp is a chance that danger will come crashing down on your head.</p>

        <p>I say if you want to skip anything mundane and boring to skip to the good stuff, then do it. If your players are itching to get to the Dark Liche&#39;s castle and take him down, then don&#39;t spend a bunch of time on camping/healing/whatever. Just say you rest up, and get to the fun. </p>
