Consider this:<br /><br />Empowered Magic<br />When you cast a spell, on a 10+ you have the option of choosing from the 7-9 list. If you do, you may choose one of these as well:<br />•The spell’s effects are maximized<br />•The spell’s targets are doubled<br /><br />Question - is one the &quot;normal&quot; 7-9 options chosen in addition to one of the &quot;bonus&quot; options, or just the &quot;bonus&quot; option?
