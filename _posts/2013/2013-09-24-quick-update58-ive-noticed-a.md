<b>Quick update:</b> I&#39;ve noticed a couple of people have gotten the pack from RPGnow or via the direct link and might not have got the discount. I&#39;ve re-applied this as a general discount now - here&#39;s the new link: <a href="http://rpg.drivethrustuff.com/product_info.php?products_id=119460" class="ot-anchor">http://rpg.drivethrustuff.com/product_info.php?products_id=119460</a><br /><br />If anyone thinks they&#39;ve not got the discount price ($4.10) hit me up on hangouts and we&#39;ll work it out. Thanks!<br /><br />---<br />Hi all,<br /><br />Just wanted to say thanks again to everyone who helped out with my new adventure pack. I&#39;ve published it to DTRPG today - here&#39;s a day-one discount (valid until the start of October) as my way of saying thanks!<br /><br />If you&#39;ve not heard of it yet, here&#39;s the blurb:<br /><i>The sand billows about you, obscuring the old road and making your eyes water. Ahead, the silhouette of the &quot;fortunate city&quot; looms. What will this venerable capital contain for you and your party - riches, fame and glory? Or corruption, scandal and death far from your home?</i><br /><br /><b>Shadows of Umberto</b> is a framework for running Dungeon World adventures within, above, below and beyond an ancient city teetering on the brink of revolution. Will your party be heralds to a glorious new order, or help usher in the city&#39;s demise? One way to find out...<br /><br />Hope you enjoy - let me know what you think!

        <p>Yeah, this is going to mess up my to-read list something awful as it shots to the top.</p>
