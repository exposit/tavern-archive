So one of the biggest things I didn&#39;t like about using ability scores AND modifiers instead of just the modifiers was having to look up at what point your modifiers increase when raising your ability scores.<br /><br />And I <b>JUST</b> realized... you don&#39;t actually need to do that at all, because it&#39;s all in your starting spread: you&#39;ve got the point where -1 becomes 0 (8 and 9), the point where 0 becomes +1 (12 and 13), and the point where +1 becomes +2 (15 and 16). If you can just remember 18=+3, then you&#39;ve got the rest right there on your character sheet.<br /><br />Well played, Adam and Sage, well played.

        <p>Also, you get +1 to ability scores each level, which is a very elegant way of allowing characters to increase attributes without using a move to do so.</p>

        <p>Yeah, I think the starting stat spreads were incredibly clever in how they are laid out. Definitely a nice touch of the game.</p>

        <p>I wish I could say we considered half this stuff, but some of it is just happy coincidence.</p>

        <p>We knew we wanted the scores and modifiers to matter, but a lot of this other stuff more or less fell out of it.</p>
