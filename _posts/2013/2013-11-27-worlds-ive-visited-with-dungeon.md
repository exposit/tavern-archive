Worlds I&#39;ve visited with <i>Dungeon World</i>, for a brief period or a longer staying.<br /><br /><b>The Spirit World</b>: Where there are spirits everywhere, the nomadic Halfling being a natural channel for them, being them nature or death spirits, where the Forest Elvesslive in total isolations, warring between themselves with bronze axes, dueling with magical songs and remember the treachery of the Western Elves, who learned necromancy and the corrupt formulaic magic of humans, and where the deads are coming back because the Death God has been shattered in six different pieces. And Love makes you human...<br /><br /><b>The Hollow World</b>: Where armored bears with a somewhat vague sense of individuality came from the stars in ages past to protect the world, and on the <i>internal</i> superfice little squirrel-men with fast live gather in tribes between the trees of the jungle, under a sun made from the molten core and a moon when one cas see a mysterious city. In between, in the dark tunnels, live the gnome-like Lapis; for them fantasy and history are sins. They worship keeping them in working order the machines that crisscross the underheart. Something there is stirring, and giant moles are awakening and mutating, while Magic takes human form.<br />The whole planet is just a giant egg about to hatch, and the machine of the Ancient Ones are keeping it in dormient state, but they are starting to fail. The Lapis are trying to prevent this, but they are creating devastating heartquakes on the Bear&#39;s world and opening passages between the two worlds...<br /><br /><b>The Archipelago</b>: A tropical chain of islands, where tribal Humans lived isolated, in a tense peace with the predator Elves with night-black skin and razor-like teeths wandering the sea and ferocious, cannibalistic and primitive Halfling, until conquering Dwarves came with steel vessels and colored beards, imposing the law and customs of a distant land and culture. <br />Strange things dwell in the open sea between the island: gigantic creatures and strange cultures of carnivorous fish-men...<br /><br /><b>Havenford</b>: A commercial city, ruled by a corrupt <i>potestas</i>, an haven for escaped slaves from thegreat cities of the coast, bordering the holy woods protected by sacred rangers. The city is building machines to attack the forest to fuel its expansion, while the haugthy Elves, sure in their mountain valley and of their link to the gods, look down on this uprising men, thinking about remembering them their place. A demon lurks in the city, controlling the organized crime and the upcoming expansion...<br /><br /><b>A World of Steel and Blood</b>: The blood-thirsty God King rules over Civilization, and everything natural is destroyed in front of his violent, fanatic warriors. When the plain of Law brings forth steel angels to transform the world in a perfect metal form the God King sends his men to fight them: this is not his civilization, not his Law...<br /><br />I love collaborative worldbuilding. I <i>really</i> love it.<br /><i>Dungeon World</i> is not my ideal for this (I still have to find it, I should deepen my knowledge of <i>Microscope</i>) but it is giving me a lot of fun and satisfaction.<br /><br />Thank you ^^﻿
