First time building an item, the idea just struck me inspired by a HUD element from Thief: The Dark Project, in the spirit of <a rel="nofollow" class="ot-hashtag" href="https://plus.google.com/s/%23ThiefWeek/posts">#ThiefWeek</a>.  Feedback highly desired!<br /><br /><b>Ring of Shadows</b><br /><br />A thin ring of smooth iron clasping a shard of onyx.  If you look at the onyx closely enough, its blackness seems to shift just below the surface.<br /><br />When you <b>evade or avoid a watchful eye</b>, take +1.

        <p>Intentionally left out reference to a specific move, because there have been several good takes on Stealth moves posted here, and I also want to leave it broad enough to work with the base-rules take of &quot;use Defy Danger+DEX for stealth&quot;.</p>

        <p>For the specific thing you&#39;re trying to emulate, I might make the trigger <b>when you use the shadows to your advantage</b><br /><br />I&#39;m trying to think of how to make it more interesting than a flat +1 forward, since I generally prefer non-numerical solutions, but I&#39;m not sure how to do that and make it broadly applicable.</p>

        <p>That was kind of my dilemma.  I try to favor the fiction, but a straight <i>well-restricted</i> +1 feels like it has the proper weight.</p>

        <p>When looking at your ring it will tell you how visible you are to anyone in proximity. <br /><br />Would just give you the HUD element while still beeing useful.</p>
