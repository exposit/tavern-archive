Just wanted to ask. Has anybody made a battle mage class? I&#39;d really like to play one!

        <p>Try the Wizard, Mage or Channeler. <br />The class i am working on has some elements of that but not in the blasty kind of way. </p>

        <p>I second what <span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink" href="https://plus.google.com/110330901807759406775" oid="110330901807759406775">Tim Franzke</a></span> said. Especially if you play a Mage of the Tower. Those guys can be huge battle mages.</p>

        <p>The problem I have with the Mage and the Wizard (I don&#39;t think I have the channeler class) is that they both rock the d4 for damage and HP.<br /><br />I know thats a sissy mechanical issue, but it bothers me.<br /><br />Otherwise I would happily take the Wizard without the ritual ability.</p>

        <p>If you just want a blaster type, the Mage&#39;s Black Magic move actually does d8 damage, and you can improve on that with advances.<br /><br />If you want to have the &quot;sword and spell&quot; thing going on, you could go Bard, and pick up Signature Weapon and Black Magic with your first two multiclass moves?</p>

        <p>Hmm, yeah, the HP thing is tricky. I guess the Channeler is a decent pick in that regard: they do have 10+constitution HP, and they roll +CON in order to do magic. And their magic is most dangerous at close range, which is appropriate. But their damage die is still a d4, and all of their moves are about their magic (which is explosive and dangerous and destroying their body, hence the CON focus).</p>

        <p>Oo, another thought: the Battlemaster (from Grim World, same as the Channeler) is a cunning and versatile front-line warrior who specialises in surprising their enemies with unusual tactics. If they could also turn invisible or levitate, that&#39;d be pretty epic. Plus, they&#39;re INT-focused, do d8 damage, and have a base HP of 10.</p>
