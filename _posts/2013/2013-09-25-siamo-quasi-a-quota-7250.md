        <p>Can I suggest you to try <i>Fiasco</i> for that scenario?<br /><br />It seems perfect to me ;-)</p>

        <p>You are welcome.<br /><br />The point is: with DW you need to carefully coordinate with your players. You can agree on the theme and on the initial purpose of the party (&quot;I would like to play a game where the party is a bunch of criminals planning an heist&quot;, the write some good initial and world moves, maybe), but you should be ready to have the thing taking another direction at a moment notice, and you need several session to pull it off.<br /><br />Fiasco seems perfect to pull it off in a single game.<br />And I <i>always</i> recommend Fiasco, it&#39;s a great game!<br />Here you can find a &quot;Dragon Slayer&quot; playset full of fantasy tropes: <a href="http://www.bullypulpitgames.com/downloads/" class="ot-anchor">http://www.bullypulpitgames.com/downloads/</a><br />I don&#39;t usually suggest Dragon Slayers as a first-time scenario, but since Fiasco is a very quick game you can try a game or three and then go for it.<br /><br />Another great scenario for your idea would be the Planar City of Dis, that you will find in the Planarch Codex: it is a sprawling, multicultural city, where everything is a danger and has rules for create new hibrid races (my father was an orc, my mother a mermaid) and for play a band of freeboter scum, surviving in the alleys of the tentacular (sometimes literally) city.<br />Just throw a couple of love letters in it and you are gold ^^</p>
