In the last couple of week&#39;s in our Dungeon World game I&#39;ve managed to kill two PCs. Nearly 15 years playing with this group without a character death and then two in quick succession. It&#39;s proper old school in Dungeon World.

        <p>I&#39;ve not killed anyone yet, but what I&#39;ve noticed is if you&#39;re used to 4e or some other game where your players have high HP, there&#39;s a thought to have monsters who do DAMAGE. <br /><br />I&#39;ve done a lot with simple numbers, attacked by bandits, forcing players to use resources or be separated. I haven&#39;t killed any players, but I they got hurt and felt it.</p>

        <p>True enough. I&#39;ve been deliberately trying to avoid just handing out HP damage on hard moves, mostly to force me to be more creative. Last night the ranger wrestled with an invisible assassin wielding a poisoned blade and rolled poorly. She took a foot of poisoned steel to the liver. I didn&#39;t feel the need to mention hit points at all at that point.</p>

        <p>What were the other players doing? Aid is a wonderful tool and so is Defend.</p>

        <p>I&#39;ve killed my son&#39;s character but it was really down to bad choices on his part.</p>

All the other PCs were in bed. She did have her wolf with her, which took revenge on the assassin as she fled.</p>

        <p>Ouch. Bad move on the Ranger. She separated by choice.</p>

        <p>It&#39;s worked out well though, as the ranger&#39;s player admitted she wasn&#39;t completely happy with how the character was developing. Back to a fighter or barbarian for plenty of smashing things I suspect.</p>

        <p>It works out then. And everyone else got the bond resolved when she died.</p>

        <p>I have not yet killed a player,   I had one sucide to save the party though.   I have had one of my characters die. Though that was the risk I took to control a God.   It didn&#39;t work out.</p>

        <p>Out of curiosity. How did the players respond to their characters deaths +Myles Corcoran?</p>

        <p>The first player was happy enough with the Last Breath move and the bargain he struck (soul bound to a divine relic and not really anchored in his body anymore). The second player wasn&#39;t upset her PC died; she wasn&#39;t fully comfortable with the character as he was developing. <br /><br />Given the success of two player deaths I must kill off PCs more often.</p>
