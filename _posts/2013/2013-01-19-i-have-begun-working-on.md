I have begun working on a DW campaign file for Maptool. If you would like to try it you can get it from:  <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/austwizgames/Home/downloads" class="ot-anchor">downloads | austwizgames</a><br /><br />You need to know how to use Maptool. No doco support at this time.

        <p>Nobody knows how to use Maptool. It&#39;s the only piece of software I&#39;ve found that rivals the GIMP in terms of actively expressed contempt for usability.</p>

        <p>That&#39;s interesting. I&#39;ve never heard anyone express contempt for the GIMP of Maptool....</p>

        <p>Not sure how that error crept in, fixed now.<br /><br />Yes Maptool is not overly user friendly, but the features it has make it worth the effort.  AND it has a very helpful and active community if you have problems.</p>
