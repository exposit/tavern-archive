The weekly Dungeon World game I play in is off the chain. Our wizard is evil, our paladin has been infected with the crazies for a bit and my elven ranger couldn&#39;t make a decent roll to save his life lol. Our fighter on the other hand straight did work with his spear and shield against anything he faced. Epic session. Coming from a mainly Pathfinder and D&amp;D 3.5 guy, this game and system just rocks. I really look forward to this Tuesday night game every week..\m/

        <p>Haha.. Right on buddy..I do like the fact that bad rolls rewards XP and it just shapes up this system into it&#39;s own monster. Phil you&#39;re running us an awesome game too bud and many thanks</p>
