I had a flash of insight this weekend. I&#39;d been reading a trade paperback of &quot;Dr. McNinja&quot; comics, and it occurred to me that DW&#39;s monster creation process hews to McNinja&#39;s &quot;Inverse Ninja Law.&quot; (&quot;One ninja is an elite and powerful adversary. Multiple ninjas make a group of faceless and incompetent pawns.&quot;) Granted that DW monsters aren&#39;t necessarily faceless or incompetent, but it&#39;s true that the more of something there are, the less powerful they are, all other things being equal.<br /><br />Nothing more to say except that this realization amused me greatly.

        <p>Ha! I hadn&#39;t thought of it that way. The reasoning behind it is that anything that can fight all on it&#39;s own <i>must</i> be pretty badass.</p>

        <p>Oh, absolutely. It&#39;s the same dramatic convention that McNinja turned into a satirical &quot;law.&quot; If there&#39;s a horde of something, they&#39;re meant to go down like punks so as to demonstrate the awesomeness of the protagonists. Also, because an army of badasses would just crush the good guys like grapes.</p>
