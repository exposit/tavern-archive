Icons and/or Planescape factions?<br />We&#39;re starting Planarch Codex campaign and one of my players wants to incorporate 13 Age&#39;s Icons into it. I can see how Planescape-like faction can work the same way. The question is how to do it DW-style? <br />I&#39;ve got a bunch of though but nothing brilliant.

        <p>Basic move is ok:<br /><b>Graven Image</b><br />You&#39;ve got an Icon that fills your entire life with sense. Choose one:<br />* it&#39;s a person you admire (e.g. Vecna)<br />* it&#39;s a code you follow (e.g. Seven Tenets of Justice)<br />* it&#39;s a goal you chase (e.g. godhood)<br />* it&#39;s a principle you live by (e.g. we all are dead)<br />* it&#39;s a phenomenon you despise (e.g. slavery)<br /><br />Then there are variants, and I don&#39;t really like any of them:<br />* Add one move associated with your Icon to the list of your racial moves.<br />* Make a moves list similar to racial ones, but activated with Cha.<br />* You can use your Icon as a leverage.<br />* Write a bond with your Icon. When you use your bond as a leverage, you can strike it out, mark XP and write a new one.</p>

        <p>I don&#39;t know Icons, but if I were doing Planescape factions, I&#39;d go ahead and give everyone a free faction move on top of what they start with, and then write up compendium classes for those who delve more into the powerful mysteries of said faction&#39;s philosophy.</p>

        <p>Faction move like what? Give an example, please. Maybe the faction alignement would be better?</p>

        <p>ANARCHIST: You are familiar with how to present yourself as a member of every other faction: from secret hand signals to faction slang and jargon. As long as you don&#39;t do anything suspicious, nobody will question your membership in whatever faction you are presenting as.<br /><br />When you prove to your fellow guild members that you pay more than lip service to the Anarchists&#39; philosophy, you may take the following moves as if they were class moves:<br /><br />RABBLE ROUSER: When you whip up an angry mob, roll +CHA, take -1 if you&#39;re not in a city or densely populated area. On a 10+, there&#39;s a riot. On a 7-9, choose one:<br /> - They&#39;re not mad at who you want them to be mad at, but somebody close.<br /> - Things get a bit more out of hand than you wanted.<br /> - Anyone asking around will be able to trace this mob back to you.<br /><br />And some other moves as appropriate.</p>

        <p>I was messing with some faction moves early on in work on Dark Heart, but ended up cutting them because I didn&#39;t have time to playtest them thoroughly and they were probably too complicated.<br /><br />It essentially worked like this:<br /><br />1. The strength of each faction in the city was rated from -2 to +3 (the normal DW/AW scale). -2 was for the super weak, +3 for the strongest.<br /><br />2. Between sessions, the GM would roll for the action each faction took to advance their interests (seize something, grow their numbers, sabotage another faction, etc.). If fictionally appropriate, the GM could also increase or decrease a given faction&#39;s strength based on how they were doing in the faction game. Maybe the Begger&#39;s Guild rises from -1 to +0 or even +1 when a powerful witch takes over their leadership. Sometimes factions also get dissolved, broken into multiple factions, merged together, or just stop being important to the game. You can stat up factions kinda like monsters, with their own agendas, instincts, special moves, etc.<br /><br />3. The PCs are independent agents, even if they are allied with one or more factions, and the things they do in play essentially count as &quot;extra moves&quot; in the faction war. So there were some guidelines for how to take their actions into account when making your faction moves between sessions.<br /><br />Essentially, it was just a different way to handle fronts (which is similar to what the &quot;Is that job still available?&quot; move does now, i.e. iterate the offscreen fiction).<br /><br />Not sure if I&#39;ll come back to the faction game in this form, but I&#39;d be interested to hear what other people thought of this approach and how it could potentially be improved.</p>
