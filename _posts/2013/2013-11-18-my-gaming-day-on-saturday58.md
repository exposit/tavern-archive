My gaming day on Saturday:<br />09:00-12:00  Merchants and Marauders, the definitive Pirate board game, and the only game I ever gave &quot;10&quot; on BGG. <br /><br />13:00-16:00 Pathfinder Society: Rescuing a wayward heiress (a bit like Paris Hilton?) from her evil father.<br /><br />19:00-22:00 DUNGEON WORLD! My first face to face DW game as a player. One of the guys in our regular group (he is 12th grade in high school) decided he wanted to GM. I did not even know if he read the rules, so I went with slight reservations... Then he opened the game with: &quot;You find yourself in a forest. It is high summer but you are cold. There is frost in your hair and in your clothes. You lie on a bed of broken ice. You remember nothing - not even your name.&quot; OK, I was hooked immediately. The story proceeded from there as a mystery as the characters tried to find out who they were and ended in an abandoned castle fighting a werewolf demon thingy that could summon darkness like a cloud of smoke and run upside down on the ceiling. Scary bastard - he did 2d12 damage and had a few of us piddling our pants. <br /><br />DW is the first RPG he ever played, and this was his first time as GM. <br /><br />Thomas, if you read this, WELL DONE! WE&#39;RE COMING BACK FOR MORE!
