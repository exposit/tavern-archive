So, I have a question on Hirelings... are the Skills the big groups (Adept, Burglar, Minstrel, etc.) or are they the more specific actions (Arcane Assistant, Experimental Trap Disarming, A Hero&#39;s Welcome)?<br /><br />So when I get a hireling, do I get a Protector +2 or do I get a hireling with Sentry +2 and Intervene +0? I&#39;m leaning towards the second path, but want to know what others do.
