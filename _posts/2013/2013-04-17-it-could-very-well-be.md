It could very well be that Dungeon World is one of the best all round roleplaying games I have ever read.<br /><br /><br />Just sayin&#39;. Haven&#39;t played it yet. But I am decidedly optimistic

        <p>When I read it, I had this feeling that it was the D&amp;D I always wanted to play :)</p>

        <p>It&#39;s pretty interesting in my experience:  while I love it and some of my friends pretty much only want to play this going forward, I have some other friends who really like the rules of Pathfinder (for example) and find DW uncomfortable.  I&#39;m firmly in the DW camp, personally, but it has proven surprisingly divisive.   It&#39;s a bit of a chocolate vs. vanilla thing- you just like what you like I suppose.  I have to say though that DW conjures up much more compelling stories IMO, where as Pathfinder (again, for example) is a fun tactical game.  </p>
