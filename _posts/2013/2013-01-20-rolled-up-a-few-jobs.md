Rolled up a few jobs for the local tavern wall from the Planarch Codex table:<br /><br />Bloody work for those with the stomach for such things. Need highly skilled operators to get into an arcane library tower that is never in the same place two nights in a row and destroy an infernal item. Begin negotiations for employment at the Malsheemi Merchants&#39; Guild, where an array of eclectic arcane and mundane payment options are offered.<br /><br />Holy work being offered, a delivery to a demi-god&#39;s distant holy shrine on a distant plane so that my tithe might be delivered. Time sensitive. Pay can be in gold, gems, secrets, maps and more.<br /><br />Professional adventuring party needed - bodyguard work for guild wizard. Please apply in person to the Wizard&#39;s Guild Tower with list of appropriate references.<br /><br />Guards needed to keep pilgrims safe while they walk the Kas Road. Food and pack animals provided. Payment in full upon reaching the City of a Thousand Swords.<br /><br />Who squats in our harbor within those alien ships? Why are they here? I will pay you to find out! Inquire in the Manticore Tower and be prepared to discuss pay and begin immediately. How long can we afford to wait?

        <p>According to the Laws of Dis we must inform any adventurers or freebooters who might consider the following job that it will put you in the midst of a holy war. When and if you inquire in person we will, by Dis Law, have to inform you one more time and then our lawful obligation will be met. The Holy Executioner, servant of Blind Justice is seeking the Trickster with 13 Faces for crimes perpetrated on several planes. Inquire about this work at the Gallows Temple.</p>

        <p>Adventurers needed to aid a man possessed by an alien god. From what many of the best alienist summoners can tell us, the deity from another reality is seeking a pilgrim who ventured from this deep plane and is now in Dis. Inquire among the Nurse Warden&#39;s Guildhouse.</p>
