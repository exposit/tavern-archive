&gt;&gt;Tricks of the Trade<br />When you pick locks or pockets or disable traps, roll+DEX. On 10+, you do it, no problem. On a 7–9, you still do it, but the GM will offer you two options between suspicion, danger, or cost.&lt;&lt;<br /><br />In the above Thief move, how is the &quot;GM will offer two options&quot; phrase supposed to be interpreted? Is it two of the three listed options, i.e., Suspicion or Danger, or two options for one of the listed options, e.g., Suspicion - Lady Anne may have seen you steal the purse or King Lon knows you stole the purse.

        <p>I interpret in a third way; the GM must give the player two choices, each of a different kind. Example:<br /><br /><i>The Thief Argelwargel rolls a weak hit when he tries to pick a lock in a dungeon. The GM chooses danger and cost and, tells Argelwargel that he&#39;ll either notify some of the goblins of his presence, or he&#39;ll have to use a tool from his adventurers kit, expending a use.</i></p>

        <p>They don&#39;t even really have to be from different groups, those are just there to inspire the GM. It could be between really forcing the lock, and destroying your lockpicks (cost) or taking a long time to do it right (cost).</p>
