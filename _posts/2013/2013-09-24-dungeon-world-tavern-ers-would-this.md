Lets say that you (or one of the other players) is part of a prestigious order, of knights, wizards, or whatever. This order has asked you to deliver mail to a city or town on the edge of the wilderness. Here are your instruc...

        <p>Definitely, though I would expand it past the edge of town and push it to in-between cities/safe places, like the pony express of the wild west.</p>

        <p>That sounds pretty fun. Thank you!</p>

        <p>It&#39;s a good scenario, if a little menial, but it&#39;s missing the DW questions that hook the players in.<br />e.g. <br />There&#39;s a special letter in the bundle - what&#39;s special about it?<br />Why has the Order asked you to deliver this mail?<br />One of the letters is addressed to someone you know, who is it and what&#39;s special about them?<br />One of the party is from the destination city, what&#39;s waiting for you there? </p>

        <p>I like the idea. I started an adventure pack around being on the road (the sort of thing that might otherwise be covered by the &quot;perilous journey&quot; move) but it never got anywhere. I think you&#39;ve got a stronger start, as the delivery gives the PCs a clear purpose.</p>
