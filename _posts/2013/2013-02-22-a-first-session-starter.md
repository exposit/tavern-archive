<b>A First Session Starter?</b><br />or maybe a Campaign Front...<br /><br />Three days ago, as foretold by the Seer of the City of Coins, a meteor streaked overhead. The shockwave caused extensive damage and injuries throughout the city, and terrified the more skittish and superstitious locals. They may very well have reason to be afraid.... <br /><br />• Where/ what did the meteorite hit when it landed? <br />• What object does the Seer think the meteorite really is? <br />• Who sent you to retrieve it from the still-smoking crater? What did they offer you for bringing it to them? <br />• A third party also seeks the object. Who are they, and why don&#39;t you want them to have it?
