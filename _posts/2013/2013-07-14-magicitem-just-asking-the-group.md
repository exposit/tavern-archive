<a rel="nofollow" class="ot-hashtag" href="https://plus.google.com/s/%23MagicItem/posts">#MagicItem</a><br /><br />Just asking the group for help making a magical item, never made one before.<br /><br />And since I couldn&#39;t find it (and we&#39;re all nerds) so it had to be made<br /><br />The Compass of Desire<br />Constructed in times forgotten this was the first of many gifts given to the Guardians. As the Guardians were known to have but one desire - to protect the realm, the compass would direct them to any and all conflict they desired to stop. When the Guardians were lost to time, so were the gifts. The first thief who discovered the Compass found it pointed to more than mere conflict. The thief found it pointed to that which he desired most. Eventually it would only point at the wealth he amassed and he discarded it, deciding the magic of it had been lost. The item does nothing more than point in the direction of the thing (be it person, item, or location) the individual possessing the compass.
