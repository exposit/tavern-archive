Here&#39;s my advice for gamers who are new to Dungeon World:<br /><br />Forget that you&#39;re playing a roleplaying game. Just sit around with your friends and tell a story. Describe it just like you would a movie. If you&#39;re the GM, try to make the villains, scenery and minor characters as awesome and weird as possible. If you&#39;re a player, make your character as awesome as you can, and make the other players&#39; characters awesome, too.<br /><br />Every now and then, you&#39;ll say something that triggers a move. Moves add elements to the story to make it cooler and more interesting. Sometimes the move will have you roll dice. After making the move, get back to telling the story as soon as possible, and again forget that you&#39;re playing a roleplaying game.

        <p>I&#39;ve been running The Regiment like this, so I appreciate you reminding me that I should be running DW like this too:)</p>

        <p>Not only is that good advice, it&#39;s how the game is played!<br /><br />Eloquently put!</p>

        <p>I would love to see a video of a group playing out a small tavern brawl...first in D&amp;D, then in DW. (same characters/Archetypes, same scenario, etc.)</p>

        <p>That would make a fascinating little experiment.</p>
