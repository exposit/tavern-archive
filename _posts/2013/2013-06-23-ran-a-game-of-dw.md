Ran a game of DW over the weekend and really enjoyed it, but I have to say I was a bit overwhelmed as the GM not being used to not having init and not rolling dice :).<br /><br />I do really need to kind of buckle down and get a better hold on Tags so that I can better understand how to use some of them.  Ones like &quot;Messy&quot; where there isn&#39;t a direct mechanical statement of how they work really kind of threw me as I was always busy trying to think of what next and narrating the combat I would forget to use these tags.<br /><br />Also kind of got hung up on 2 pc&#39;s on one monster combat and brain seized up (ahhh old age setting in).  I am going to have to really do another read of the book to better understand a few things.<br /><br />All in all players had a good time we were all amazed at how much was accomplished in the time we played. <br /><br />Certainly would love to run it again!

        <p>Do you mean that you were overwhelmed because you found it hard to get the combat started?</p>

        <p>Have you read this:  <a href="http://www.dungeon-world.com/dungeon-world-guide/" class="ot-anchor">http://www.dungeon-world.com/dungeon-world-guide/</a> ?  It&#39;s highly recommended for better wrapping of your head around this game.</p>

        <p>Mainly overwhelmed in a good way focusing on describing things and such hehe. <br /><br />Actually have read the guide too and I highly recommend it. It does help a lot!<br /><br />I need to read it again as well hehe.</p>

        <p>Don&#39;t stress over the tags too much. They&#39;re there to inspire your fiction. If you don&#39;t need the extra inspiration it&#39;s all good. Your players aren&#39;t gonna notice.</p>
