Quick overview of how much damage you could get on 1 attack..<br /><br />Fighter Base Damage 1d10<br />+ 1d6 if you expose yourself to Danger on a 10+ <i>H&amp;S</i><br />+ 2 damage from signature weapon (hooks&#39;n&#39;spikes + Serrated Edges)<br />+ 1d8 <i>Merciless</i><br />+ 1d8 <i>Taste of Blood</i><br />+ 3d4 from fully boosted <i>Arcane Art</i> from your Bard Friend<br />+ 1d4 from a Magic Weapon Spell<br />+ 1d4 from your Paladin Buddys <i>Setup Strike/Tandem Strike</i><br /><br /><br />As a Fighter you get 2 multiclass moves, the most damage you can get from these is with these options: (i think)<br />+2d4 <i>Exterminatus</i> (Paladin)<br />+1d4 <i>Viper&#39;s Strike</i> (Ranger) but you need a second weapon<br /><br />A Wizard could also cast Polymorph on you, don&#39;t know what will happen then. <br /><br />But all in all, if you can use every ressource you have avaiable that is a <br />1d10+2+2d8+8d4 = 31 damage on an average,<br />60 damage if everything comes up maximum.<br /><br />This of course is purely theoretical and won&#39;t probarbly happen like this in a game, but knowledge is about 50% of any given conflict.

        <p>Hahah, I worked that same thing out the other day and fired it off to a buddy of mine. His response was an incredulous, &quot;Why are you trying to powergame DUngeon World?!&quot; I shrugged and said, &quot;it&#39;s not because I want to, but because I can.&quot; It does really require a significant devotion to one shtick, along with having three allies work in tandem to benefit you, but I think that could be a pretty cool scene, altogether. Still, I&#39;d rather have a character with more interesting options. Just say screw it and take Shapeshifter and become a Dire Bulette or something and eat my foes whole ;)</p>
