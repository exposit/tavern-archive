OK so I need some advice.  I had a bit of a train wreck of a session the other night,  thought I could totally wing it and well I couldn&#39;t. <br /><br />Anyway after some honest but good critique from my players I intend to try and salvage the game this coming Wednesday.<br /><br />So onto something that proved to be troublesome in the game.<br /><br />The players room in the inn they were staying in had been raided by guards of the king.  They were searching the room and one of my players rolled for Discern realities but failed,  so great, he gets an XP.  But we couldn&#39;t really agree on how this failure should have manifested itself. <br /><br />Any thoughts?

        <p>First off, I often like to make &quot;searching the room&quot; into a role-playing experience and avoid Discern Realities if I can (i.e., asking them what they&#39;re looking at/for, and giving them answers). If Discern Realities is what you feel is appropriate though, my fallbacks are to Reveal an Unwelcome Truth — Basically, the got answers, but those answers were not something they wanted to hear. Maybe the room was trapped, maybe some assumption being made has turned out to be disastrously false —  or, to advance a grim portent. In one of my previous sessions, the players spent so much time ignoring a &quot;ticking time bomb&quot; sort of threat, that after one to many fails that I &quot;saved up&quot; behind the scenes, I simply told them that they&#39;re estimate on their time remaining was off by a matter of days, and they needed to resolve their situation immediately. Basically, use the fails that you aren&#39;t quite sure what to do with to remind the players that the world keeps moving on without them.</p>

        <p>I put up an article on that a while ago, check it out.<br /><a href="https://plus.google.com/105808699738403752805/posts/ickbSdjj14G" class="ot-anchor">https://plus.google.com/105808699738403752805/posts/ickbSdjj14G</a></p>

        <p>If there isn&#39;t any danger, you should just go ahead and tell them things. Go ahead. Don&#39;t worry about the roll.<br /><br />However, the big secret about failed rolls and hard moves is that there doesn&#39;t have to be anything causal about the hard move you make in response to a failure. Usually there is, because it makes sense and because you want to keep the action focused. But on a failure you have permission to make literally anything happen.<br /><br />So fail a Discern Realities check and:<br />* the guards return unexpectedly.<br />* someone throws a bag over the head of another PC and drags them away.<br />* a Dragon attacks the citadel.<br />Or whatever you feel like. Or if you have fronts, you can can announce a Grim Portent.</p>

        <p>Some good advice their guys.  Piers I had forgotten that tbh and I can see with the people I am playing with they may have a hard time coming to terms with a failed roll for one thing resulting in something completely different happening,  then again they don&#39;t have to know I guess!</p>

        <p>Conrad, Never Speak The Name of Your Move. That&#39;s pretty crucial. Players learn to not expect anything to happen after a roll. If they start to talk to you about rules, tell them to deal with what&#39;s going on and you&#39;ll explain it to them later.<br /><br />In my AW game, someone said to me that he was pretty sure he could run my game if I wanted a session off. I asked him what he thinks I do. He said, &quot;You just make it up without rhyme or reason.&quot; I laughed and I said, &quot;Then I have done my job right.&quot; They still don&#39;t know how I do it. I like it that way.</p>

        <p>Matt&#39;s point is crucial. Of course you are making soft/ hard moves (remember, make as hard a move as you&#39;d like), but you should be paying attention to the fiction and thinking off screen to come up with things, and checking the list of moves to help when you need to.<br /><br />With Discern Realities in a (seemingly) non-stress situation, this is often a good heuristic:<br />* player asks to Discern Realities<br />* you ask them, so what are you doing (remember: to do it, do it)<br />* when they tell you (&quot;I&#39;m looking under the beds, checking for loose floorboards, etc.&quot;) you now have enough information to come up with a soft and a hard move.<br />* If you can do that, ask for a roll on Discern Realities.<br />* If not, don&#39;t ask for a roll, just tell them what they find.<br />This way you are never caught in a situation where you&#39;ve made a roll and have to come up with a weak response.</p>

        <p>If the guards had already left and there was no pressure or constraint on the search in the fiction, rolling for it is superfluous. I just would have told them the clue that was in there.<br />Had there been pressure (the guards are still there, need to find the clue before the guards discover them, searching while they&#39;re fighting, etc), THAT&#39;s where failing is interesting. Remember, never ask them to roll if failure results in a boring situation.<br />In those cases where there&#39;s pressure on the situation, missing  on discern realities is an opportunity to introduce conflict. Maybe they get misinformation that leads them to accuse the wrong person.  Maybe they miss the trap set for them. Maybe they are so absorbed in the frenetic nature of the search that they don&#39;t notice the danger sneaking up behind them. In any case, make sure that failure leads to a chance to rise above it and be awesome.</p>

        <p>Basically, when my players say they&#39;re doing something, first I make sure I could actually make a move in reaction to it if I needed to. If I can&#39;t, then they shouldn&#39;t be rolling any dice in the first place.</p>

        <p>An alternative to rolling in this situation is to ask questions, use the answers. &quot;You search the room. What do you find?&quot;</p>

        <p>Some good further comments guys.  Sorry for the delay in my reply,  works kicking my butt.  Having to have a real think about the way forward with this game.  Was meant to be a playtest for a con game I was going to run in a few weeks but now I am going to have to work so the con is out unfortunately :-(</p>
