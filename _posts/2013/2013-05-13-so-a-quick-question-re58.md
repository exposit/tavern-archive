So a quick question re: combat scenes. Last night our intrepid party were beset upon again by goblins. <br />With Monster Moves, I presume that they have access to things like Hack and Slash too? Are monster moves played totally in response to player moves or as GM do I initiate moves when the characters have no or delayed response to the question &quot;what do you do?&quot;

        <p>I dont allow the monsters moves, they are the setting, i&#39;ll say the goblin runs under the table and spings up slashing at you, what do you do!<br /><br />if they ignore it &quot;im going to pick up the gold coins on the floor&quot;, BAM GM move of deal damage... the danger was pretty obvious<br /><br />if they act, maybe a defy danger, maybe a hack and slash, maybe a defend action.<br /><br />but monsters just DO what they do, if the players DONT act, stuff goes wrong, if they do, i then make the monsters act again as they would (or another player butts in :D ) and then its back on the players</p>

        <p>The Monster Moves are just extra &quot;go to&quot; options on scenes where that monster is involved.  You can use <b>any</b> GM move when its go-time, including Deal Damage.  Monsters don&#39;t Hack and Slash.  They Show an Approaching Threat (&quot;He runs at you bellowing in rage, sword drawn&quot;), and if the PCs fail to Hack and Slash, the monster Deals Damage.</p>

        <p>Moves that involve dice are for players only. As a GM, you make narration moves - ie, tell them what happens.</p>

        <p>In addition to what has already been said, think in terms of &quot;Action scenes&quot; instead of &quot;Combat scenes&quot; this will help you think about using the environment in addition to monsters to present an exciting scene. Use interesting movement and set pieces to engage your players</p>

        <p>That&#39;s the thing I&#39;m just coming to grips with: what&#39;s the difference between combat and the rest of a DW game? <br /><i>There&#39;s no difference.</i></p>

        <p>realyl good point <span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink" href="https://plus.google.com/113847025671240258531" oid="113847025671240258531">Adrian Thoen</a></span> I always try to use the enviroment as much as possible, it helps ground it and makes it less attack, attack, attack, like in my example the goblin running under the table, players can dive onto the table out of the way, etc... :D</p>
