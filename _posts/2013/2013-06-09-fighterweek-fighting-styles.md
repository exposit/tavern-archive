 <a rel="nofollow" class="ot-hashtag" href="https://plus.google.com/s/%23FighterWeek/posts">#FighterWeek</a>  *Fighting Styles!*<br /><br />These moves are supposed to be an extra move for the Fighter. In a perfect world there would be lot&#39;s of different fighting styles but i present you 3. Each one has a general fighting style moves and then extra ones to represent further training in the style. Right now there is one for 1 <del>Katana</del> Sword, Spear and Shield and one for a big big hammer. There is not really a reason to match them to specific weapons but it&#39;s an easy way to differentiate them. <br />As i said every Fighter would start with 1 fighting style and can choose the other Fighting Style moves later when he levels up. Getting new styles could be done by any character like one would get into a compendium class. The Fighter could easily have a Multiclass like move that gave him access to another fighting style. He is the fighter, he can figure this stuff out. <br /><br />I didn&#39;t had as much time as i wanted to put into these moves so please be gentle on them, they might not be as good but show the direction the move would take. <br />I hope you like this. <br /><br />White Swan Style (single Sword)<br />When you center yourself and deflect every blow coming at you, only attacking with counterstrikes, you may Hack&amp;Slash using WIS instead of STR. <br /><br />Iaidō<br />When you have a moment to focus and then draw your sword in one swift motion to strike your enemy you may deal damage or roll+WIS <br />On a 10+ choose 2, on a 7-9 choose 1 <br />- You take their weaponhand off <br />- You deal your damage+1d6 <br />- You slice them before they can react, giving you time to retreat<br />- Your focus gives you a moment of perfect clarity. You can ask 1 question from the discern realities list <br /><br />Iaidō Focus<br />When you use Iaidō, choose 1 extra option from the list <br /><br />Perfect Defense<br />When you Hack&amp;Slash an Enemy using the White Swan Style, take +2 armor against the next attack coming at you <br /><br /><br /><br />Boros Legion Style (Spear and Shield)<br />When you stand in Defense of one of your comrades, the first enemy getting closer then reach range with them takes a d6 of damage <br /><br />Scorpionsting Maneuver <br />When you damage an enemy in melee, you can sacrifice 4 of your damage to knock them back one range category. <br /><br />The Turtle<br />When you are forming a shieldwall with your allies, roll+CON <br />On a 10+ choose 3, on a 7-9 choose 2   <br />- You can still move<br />- You are protected against range attacks<br />- Everyone trying to brake your formation takes a d6 of damage <br />- You can still attack from behind your shieldwall <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Inspired by the THUNDERING PACHYDERM by +Craig Hatler <br /><br />Mountain Giant Style(BigAss Hammer)<br />When you hit an enemy with a forcefull weapon and throw him of his feet you get to decide where exactly they land or whom they hit in the fall <br /><br />Whipping Truck<br />When you wield a two-handed weapon by bearing its heft with just one hand, ignore the two-handed tag.<br /><br />Hammer Time!<br />When you charge into a group of enemies and bring your hammer down in a giant krakakoom roll+STR On a hit you deal 1d6 to each of them (roll once) but on a 10+ choose 1, on a 7-9 choose 2 <br />- You get attacked by two of them<br />- You get yourself into a Spot doing it<br />- You damage something you didn’t intent to hit <br /><br />Imposing Stature<br />When you parley with someone that saw you in a fight and you use the potential of violence against them as leverage, take +1 forward.

        <p>How much would this help the Fighter? Most of the starting Fighting Style moves wouldn&#39;t be active moves (should they be?) so this would mostly help to differentiate the play experience in a more passive way. </p>

        <p>I think these could help empower the choices in the signature weapon even more and look really cool. I&#39;d love I see a cleaving axe style and maybe a bare knuckle boxing style to to flesh it out. <br /><br />Awesome ideas! Really enjoy the concept.</p>

        <p>Very cool and gives a lot of inspiration. I think I&#39;ll try to develop something similar for a module I wanted to play for a long time. It is a golden era of german zweihander schools it&#39;s set in so three of for distinct styles can be made.</p>

        <p>I am loving it and only have very minor issues with how certain moves are phrased.<br /><br />Like: Iaidō - you may roll damage - so without needing to hack and slash?<br />Also: You take an opponent&#39;s hand off, but you might not get to deal damage? (depending on your choices?)<br /><br />And Scorpionsting Maneuver: You cannot choose this otpion, when you deal less than 4 damage - right?</p>

        <p>You disarm them<br />might be better yes! And yeah, you can deal damage without H&amp;S but you need the moment to focus yourself and are helpless before the strike. It a turbulent battle this is not the best idea but works wonders in a duel. <br /><br />Yes, you need at least 4 damage. I am not sure if spending damage is a mechanic that really works but i tried it. </p>

Yes, you severed his hand, no he doesn&#39;t lose a single HP. Tough as nails those old school samurai. ^_^</p>
