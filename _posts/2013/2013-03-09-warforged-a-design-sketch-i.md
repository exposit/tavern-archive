        <p>+TimFranzke, this is great stuff. LOVE the constructed ranger companion idea. I&#39;ll provide feedback asap. Playing tomorrow with some new people joining in, so I&#39;ll provide this as new player options.<br /> </p>

        <p>Tim, good stuff as usual.  Some thoughts... <br /><br />Druid -- Great opportunity to allow shapeshifting into plants/trees? <br /><br />Paladin -- Not loving the armor being able to be removed.  It&#39;s part of the body (and an obvious drawback at times).  <br /><br />Thief -- Why?  What&#39;s your thought process on this?  <br /><br />Wizard -- Feels week in comparison to other classes.  Intentional? </p>

        <p>I read &quot;Warforgerd&quot; in this lady&#39;s voice: <a href="https://twimg0-a.akamaihd.net/profile_images/1479597524/image.jpg" class="ot-anchor">https://twimg0-a.akamaihd.net/profile_images/1479597524/image.jpg</a></p>

I was thinking of transforming into machines, like siege engiens maybe but it seems to far removed from the druid. <br /><br />Paladin - maybe yeah. i&#39;m not sure<br /><br />Thief - i was looking for a way to give Warforged the ability to determine the worth of objects because they have like a giant database of valuables in their mind. A simple &quot;ask the GM what an item is worth and he will tell you&quot; might be enough.<br /><br />Wizard - is based on the Human Thief move</p>

        <p>Paladin: sans the armor removal like <span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink" href="https://plus.google.com/107145464770197437080" oid="107145464770197437080">Brennan OBrien</a></span> said, I like this one just fine.<br /><br />Druid: perhaps some sort of skingrafting could be useful? Like natural growth out of the wooden parts of its construction that would enable further custom moves. I&#39;m spitballing here but a warforged druid who is able sprout spikes from its body like a horse chestnut could be sweet.<br /><br />Thief: I would suggest for the Thief some sort of darkvision as a literal translation of your move. I suspect that is kind of what you were going for? Darkvision specifies the conditions in which it works. Alternative moves (again, just thinking out loud) hidden weapons cfr the Assassin&#39;s Creed dagger.<br /><br />Wizard: throw in a little bit of artificer and let him infuse a spell onto a specific part of its body? Though that may be taking things too far...</p>

        <p>I was thinking of making the Wizard able to be able to recall 1 spell he had forgotten &quot;per day&quot; or something like that. maybe in trade for some damage but this is still to strong i think. <br /><br />I don&#39;t see the problem with the Wizard move really. The Thief move isn&#39;t different. <br /><br />Darkvision for the Thief sounds good. Not sure how to phrase it though... <br />I still like the Idea of &quot;Ask the GM the price of a valuable and he will tell you&quot; <br />Darkvision-lenses is more Warforged.</p>

        <p>Druid is tricky. I would actually not allow warforged in my game to pick that class, the same way as Dwarfes can&#39;t be Wizards in regular DW. <br />That might seem unfair to some people though but says something about the race. They also shouldn&#39;t be Bards i think. <br /><br />Cleric is tricky. Right now it implies they are serving a particular kind of god but that might be a good thing.</p>

        <p>Added the Artificer, rewrote the Paladin and Thief (still not sure about the wording) and added a caviat about Warforged Bards and Druids. </p>
