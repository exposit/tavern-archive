played DW today, had a player jump off a roof onto someone to try and stop them (a little girl with bundle of wands)<br /><br />wasnt sure what move to make, then reaslised, custom moves!<br /><br />&quot;jump tackle&quot;<br />10+ all three<br />7-9 choose 1<br /><br />* you tackle and pin the target<br />* the target doesnt take any damage<br />* you dont take any damage<br /><br />so asking anyone would have done differently/better? <br />even so we all thought at the table it worked well ^_^

        <p>I think that&#39;s a good improv.</p>

        <p>I like it - most moves are a defy danger specific situation. Thinks this works great, you just add some specifics and gave a choice.</p>

        <p>Sounds like Defy Danger to me.</p>

        <p>Yeah my first suggestion was the defy danger but that didn&#39;t have any effect on the diving on the person or trying to grab her<br /><br />(Also the move had + dex mod)</p>

        <p>Who wouldn&#39;t choose &quot;tackle &amp; pin&quot; on a 7-9? Seems like non choice to me. This reminds me of a move I recall from a DW guide where on a 10+ one of you gets knocked down, on a 7-9 both are knocked prone. Still moves things forward but can generate more fiction, where as the pinned option is so clearly the one most players would choose.</p>

        <p>The danger in Defy Danger can be anything that makes sense in the fiction. You take damage, they take damage, whatever else? All good.</p>

        <p>Actually or thief rolled an 8 and chose not to hurt the target as he was jumping off to save her so chose to jump but she gets out of his grasp, he tumbles and takes minor injury, but she is unharmed <br /><br />And as said defy danger was my option but we felt it ignored the efforts to protect the target and to catch her ^_^</p>

        <p>To echo what <span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink" href="https://plus.google.com/104811112088336879051" oid="104811112088336879051">Eric Lochstampfor</a></span> said, a 7-9 is supposed to be a partial success. If not going for a Defy Danger move, which I think would work (though I&#39;ll admit, I like custom moves better!) I think that this would be a better solution:<br /><br />When you <b>jump to tackle a fleeing creature</b>, roll +Dex:<br />*On a 10+, you deftly knock them to the ground.<br />*On a 7-9, you tackle the foe, but choose one of the following:<br />          * You take damage<br />          * Your target takes damage</p>

        <p>ah much more elegant :)<br /><br />we were a bit hmmm when he chose to effectivly fail to do what he intended (catch the girl) by protecting her, his second instinct<br /><br />i will remember for future events! :D thanks <span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink" href="https://plus.google.com/115203550155137988258" oid="115203550155137988258">Sorcerer Blob</a></span>  i now unerstand <span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink" href="https://plus.google.com/104811112088336879051" oid="104811112088336879051">Eric Lochstampfor</a></span> &#39;s comment about moving forward the action too!</p>

        <p>This guide has good advice on custom moves, and the move I was referencing. Page 28 is when the custom move discussion but the whole guide is good and has some good content in it as well:<br /><a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/3269630/dwdotcom/eon-guide/Dungeon%20World%20Guide%20pdf%20version%201.2.pdf" class="ot-anchor">https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/3269630/dwdotcom/eon-guide/Dungeon%20World%20Guide%20pdf%20version%201.2.pdf</a></p>

        <p>The DW Guide is a fantastic (and quick) read that is super helpful at clarifying certain things.</p>
