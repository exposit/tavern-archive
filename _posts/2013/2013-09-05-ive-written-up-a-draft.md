I&#39;ve written up a draft for The Mimic class, inspired by Joe Banner &#39;s compendium class: <a href="http://tinyurl.com/lcsxl24" class="ot-anchor">http://tinyurl.com/lcsxl24</a><br />Feed back would be great,<br />also suggestions for drives/alignments, names and looks. <br /><br /><br /><br /><b>The Mimic</b><br />D6 Damage        Hp=10+Constitution<br /><br /><br /><b>Background Moves</b><br />Who were you, or where did you come from, before you learnt the art of mimicry? <br /><b>Interpretative Dancer</b><br />– Once per a session you can substitute one stat for another in a roll. Describe how you do this in the fiction.<br /><b>Warband Initiate</b><br />– You have been trained in basic arms; Ignore the Clumsy tag on armor.<br /><b><i>???</i></b><br />–  Nobody knows where you came from, or where you&#39;re going but you don&#39;t seem to leave a lasting impression. +1 to Outstanding Warrants rolls, as long as you don&#39;t reveal any noteworthy details about yourself.<br /><br /><b>Starting Moves</b><br /><br /><b>Live and Learn</b><br />When you are the target of an opponent&#39;s move, you may opt to learn it. (GM must alert you if a move is being used).You start off with on free space to house a move. If all your spaces are full, overwrite a current move. You CANNOT learn and use PC moves for Mimic.<br /><br /><b>Mimic (INT)</b><br />When you dredge from your memory someone else&#39;s move and attempt to recreate it, roll +INT. On a 10+ you succeed. On a 7-9 choose 2. On a miss the move gets away from you and leaves you in a precarious situation.<br />• You don&#39;t think you will be able to recreate this move again; forget it.<br />• You draw unwanted attention with you display<br />• You are mentally drained, take -1 ongoing to INT.<br />• The recreation is not perfect.<br /><br /><b>Learnt Moves</b><br />☐Move: <i>_________</i><br /><br /><b>Mirror Dance</b><br />When you Defend you can also spend hold to<br />• Take the hit from an opponents move, which was intended for another<br />• Automatically Mimic an opponents move, and use it against it. (You do not learn this move.)<br /><br /><b>2-5</b><br />☐ <b>Anything you can do…</b><br />You are a quick student, and eager to learn. When you Make Camp,<br />choose one move another player knows and gain hold equal to the number<br />of bonds you have with that player. You can spend 1-hold to use that move.<br />When you Make Camp, lose any remaining hold from this move.<br />☐ <b>Performer</b><br />You are an immaculate actor; you can easily imitate the basic actions of others, and their voices. You may use these skills as Leverage for Parley.<br />☐ <b>Mimic Dabbler</b><br />Gain one non-multiclass move from any class list. Choose the move as if you<br />were one level lower than you are, unless that move has to do with imitating/gaining the qualities of others.<br />☐ <b>Adept Learner</b><br />Gain two more move spaces.<br />☐ <b>Eye For Trouble</b><br />When you Discern Realities on an opponent, you can also ask<br />• What is this creatures most dangerous move<br />• What is this creatures most interesting move<br />☐ <b>Empathy</b><br />When you take a take on a creatures&#39; move, you learn that creature&#39;s language.<br />☐ <b>Logical</b><br />Take +1 forward when you spout lore about that species&#39; history or culture.<br />When you use strict deduction to analyze your surroundings, you can discern realities with INT instead of WIS.<br /><br /><b>6-10</b><br />☐ <b>…I can do better</b>		<i>Replaces  Anything you can do…</i><br />Your skill is beyond compare. When you Make Camp, choose one move<br />another player knows, and gain hold equal to the number of bonds you have<br />with that player. You can use that move until the next time you Make Camp.<br />When you use the chosen move, you can spend 1-hold to take +1 to your roll.<br />When you Make Camp, lose any remaining hold from this move.<br />☐ <b>Master Memoriser</b><br />Gain three more move spaces.<br />☐ <b>Mimic Initiate</b><br />Gain one non-multiclass move from any class list. Choose the move as if you<br />were one level lower than you are, unless that move has to do with imitating/gaining the qualities of others.<br />☐ <b>What Doesn&#39;t Kill Me…</b><br />When you roll a success on a Last Breath move, you can also automatically learn one move, of your choice, from the creature that sent you to the Black Gates. If a creature didn&#39;t send you there, mimic a move of death, GM&#39;s choice.<br />☐ <b>Eidetic memory (INT)</b><br />When you witness an NPC move in action, roll +INT. On a 10+ you learn that move. On a 7-9 choose 1.<br />• You have to move in closer to get a good look, and maybe leave yourself in a dangerous position<br />• From what you&#39;ve witnessed, you can only recreate a lesser version.<br />• You focus so hard to you find yourself dizzy, take -1 ongoing to INT, until you have a chance to rest.<br />☐ <b>Mirror Monster</b><br />You also have this option for Defend<br />• Roll the enemy&#39;s damage die against it, with the appropriate tags applied.<br />☐ <b>Excessive Empathy</b>		<i>Requires Empathy</i><br />When you observe another language being spoken, you quickly pick it up in an almost unnatural fashion.

        <p>Live and Learn violates a core GM principle!  It may need to be rewritten.</p>

        <p>Am i missing something or is the first Mimic Dance something you can already do with Defend?</p>

        <p>I agree with <span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink" href="https://plus.google.com/112484087750169360510" oid="112484087750169360510">Adam Koebel</a></span>, what if you wrote down how you saw it. So a master bladesman has the move &quot;Dazzle them with swordplay&quot;, but when the GM describes it and you decide you want to mimic the move, you write down what you think it was: &quot;Perform cool sword tricks&quot;. This way you get a move, but you have to word it yourself, avoiding breaking the GM principle</p>

        <p>Also, Mimic is a monster which makes this class super confusingly named! Any chance you&#39;d be willing to rename it to avoid that?</p>

        <p>Apologies, I only just found this. I&#39;m flattered you enjoyed the compendium class! Notwithstanding the rules queries others have mentioned, I like the thematic direction this class goes in - quite different to how I saw the original idea.<br /><br />With all the dances, performing and social skills, this seems like a character out to learn as much as possible about the world, so I&#39;d base the drives around that. Something like &quot;What drives you to copy others?&quot; Maybe &quot;Know thine enemy&quot;, &quot;Empathise with the other&quot; and something else along the lines of &quot;Learn everything about the world&quot;; that last ones a bit vague though. Look could be purposely non-specific to represent how the class takes on the appearance of others? Hope this helps!</p>
