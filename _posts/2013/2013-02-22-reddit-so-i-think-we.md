<b>[REDDIT]</b> So I think we found a god that needs to exist in every DW game:<br />[–]Mr_Bauxite<br />Ah. But. You do get to smite people in the name of a god they probably never heard of?<br /><br />[–]OFTHEHILLPEOPLE<br />There&#39;s a Hipster god in D&amp;D? &quot;Plaid, God of Insular Knowledge&quot;?<br /><br />[–]rob7030[] <br />I think my next character just got his god.<br />Mar&#39;ten Reade, skinny human cleric of Plaid, swathed in his skintight leggings and flannel vestments. He looks disinterestedly at his enemies through non-prescription bifocals as he strums halfheartedly on his lyre made by the master crafter Gi&#39;sbon and sips noisily from the caffeinated concoction he bought for three times the going price at the local apothecary with the hot, sassy barist--I mean potion makers.<br />Holy fuck I need to make this guy right now.<br /><br />[–]OFTHEHILLPEOPLE<br />He only drinks potions with blue ribbons on them.
