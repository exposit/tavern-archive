How does DW run with a lot of players? I am supposed to run a game Friday with 7 (maybe 8) players signed up, and all but 1 are complete newbies to gaming. I love DW but I&#39;m a little apprehensive about this, it&#39;s tempting to revert to tried &amp; true B/X D&amp;D. The players are two 40-something moms, a 20-something guy, and assorted kids (9, 11, 11, 11, 14).  <a rel="nofollow" class="ot-hashtag" href="https://plus.google.com/s/%23DnD/posts">#DnD</a> Â

        <p>I wouldn&#39;t go over 5, and I love B/X, so I say that&#39;s probably your best bet.</p>

        <p>I&#39;ve done it several times with 6, and at times that felt too large. The problem for me is mostly keeping everyone engaged. (But then similar problems haunt every rpg w/r size.)</p>

        <p>Yep, I don&#39;t think a lot of games scale well over 5 or so, but B/X is one of those. We had a group of 10 or so the last time I played and it was a fantastic game. Maybe run B/X for this crowd and get a couple of smaller groups for DW?</p>

        <p>Keeping everyone engaged is what I was concerned about, given the narrative nature of the game. I&#39;d run DW for 3 of them previously and had a great time, and I think they&#39;re hoping to continue that, but they planned a house party around it!</p>

        <p>A lot depends on what you are capable of - if you can keep the camera moving around, and improv interesting response moves, it could be do-able as a great demo one-shot at least.</p>

        <p>Solution: Schedule and run two DW campaigns. It&#39;s worth it!</p>

        <p>My experience running DW is limited, but I&#39;m inclined to go with the authors&#39; recommendations and call the comfortable top out point five players.  It&#39;s doesn&#39;t mean that you can&#39;t go higher, but the free-nature of combat flow (no initiative) means the burden on the GM increases a lot with each additional player insofar as insuring both a smooth flow and that every character gets their moment in the spotlight.</p>

        <p>Btw, I like the idea +Tim Jensen had.  Run two games.  I&#39;d split roughly along age lines (an old group and a young group, maybe with the mid-range overlapping if they want to play in two games).</p>

        <p>When I run 6 it feels like I get a real workout and no one else gets enough screen time. 5 works for me, but 4 is perfect. Would be curious to know how 9 and 11 year olds take to the game though.</p>

My son could act as co-GM giving each of us 3 players. It seems confusing though, wondering how it would work. I suppose the GMs could divide the monsters between them and work with whatever players they happen to be involved with. Or one gm could play &quot;adversary&quot; and run the monsters as characters while the other acts more as moderator. Or the game could involve two separate adventuring teams in the same dungeon... that would be wild!</p>

        <p>I actually think DW is more suited to larger groups then more rules-heavy games. Stick to using narrative and keep things constantly moving. The only thing I would be warey of 1 or 2 older/more experienced people dominating the GM&#39;s attention.</p>
