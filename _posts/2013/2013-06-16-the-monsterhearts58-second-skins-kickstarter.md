The Monsterhearts: Second Skins Kickstarter ends in a few hours. The final stretch goal includes a little add-on game by <span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink" href="https://plus.google.com/111694100408744715863" oid="111694100408744715863">Jonathan Walton</a></span> that he is calling Dungeonhearts. He describes it as: &quot;A 2-page outline for playing homeless monster teens who&#39;ve holed up in that abandoned school on the outskirts of town.&quot; What do they do when those &quot;normal&quot;, adventurous kids come in exploring?<br /><br />Go throw a few bucks at the Kickstarter to lock in the chance to see what happens when the D&amp;D kids invade the goth kids&#39; turf. Not to mention all the other cool stretch goals, too.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1571708637/monsterhearts-second-skins" class="ot-anchor">http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1571708637/monsterhearts-second-skins</a>
