I&#39;ve loved Dungeon World from the first time I read it, and playing it inspired me to write 4 player classes with unique fictional hooks to drive your game in new and interesting ways.<br /><br />I love that the character you choose can so dramatically change what the game will be about, and have tried to experiment and push this idea with my playbooks. I like the flexibility so much, many of the playbooks I&#39;ve made have alternate versions to reflect different archetypes of the classes. Are you a big friendly giant, or a giant jerk? Is your spellslinger more fantasy, or the good, the bad, and the ugly Wild West?<br /><br />It was recently my birthday, and I wanted to offer my playbooks at a discount to the dungeon world community that&#39;s given such great support to all of its creators! So for the month of October, all of my playbooks are just $1 from drivethru rpg.

        <p>Oh, but I will :) Maybe my players would like to play one of them in our coming campaign, who knows?</p>

        <p>So, Adrian, I&#39;m curious about your playtesting procedures. How do you playtest them, how extensively, etc?</p>

        <p>I&#39;d also like to say that I bought all of your classes, and I think they&#39;re just wonderful! I&#39;m just curious because I have quite a few classes in various stages of completeness, and wanted to hear how you did playtesting.</p>

        <p>For play testing, I basically throw the google doc at the dungeon world thread on SA, or run one-shots online. <br /><br />Feedback from people playing the class in a game I&#39;m not running is very useful since then I&#39;m not there to interpret anything  I&#39;ve written poorly. That will most clearly expose rough edges. <br /><br /></p>

        <p>That&#39;s an excellent idea! I&#39;ve always playtested them with my groups.</p>
