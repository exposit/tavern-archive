Any Brooklyn based players looking for a game?<br /><br />I am running one which is a lot of fun but is very infrequent (maybe once every 6 weeks or so).  I&#39;d love to run a game for a few folks closer to every 3 weeks or so.  <br /><br />Prefer to play semiseriously, meaning actually investing a bit in the story, characters and world.  I am in my mid-30s and prefer to play with folks who are post-college age because I am old and find your youthful energy repulsive.  <br /><br />I can host or travel (within my sweet home borough).  <br /><br />I&#39;ll try the standard forums, but have had no luck with them in the past.  If people have other suggestions for places to post I&#39;m definitely open to it.

Greene, but work in Manhattan so could chat there.  Or we can just try out a session and see if it clicks.</p>

        <p>I&#39;m down to just try it out. I played a bunch of pickup games at PAX East so I&#39;m used to diving in. Character creation is part of the process and only takes 15 mins... so why not? I could potentially host around Union Square on days other than Sun/Mon. I also have one other guy interested who played with me at PAX East.</p>
