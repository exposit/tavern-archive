Getting VERY excited about converting our Darkmoor campaign setting over to DW. Looking into making a few houseruled changes, one of which concerns the <b>level 11+</b> game.<br /><br />I&#39;m considering offering my players two new options once they hit level 11. The first one involves a point system. At level 10, every 17xp earned gives the PC <b>Fate Points</b> (or something like that) which can be spent during gameplay. I haven&#39;t figured this out entirely yet, but re-rolls seem like a traditional fit.<br /><br />The second option is to allow the player to let their PC go down in a <b>Blaze of Glory</b>. When they&#39;ve reached what would be level 11, they don&#39;t earn any more xp but now have access to a move which basically lets them get the party through any one scenario, but their PC dies in the process. How this happens in the fiction would be completely up to the PC (within reason of course).

        <p>I would also imagine that very specific compendium classes would make a lot of sense. Work with the players to find out.</p>

        <p>I love the Blaze of Glory idea. That&#39;s awesome. You might also think about adding something in like the death gift (from Amagi games, <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/amagigames/the-death-gift" class="ot-anchor">the death gift | amagigames</a> for a direct link, it&#39;s an awesome site) fit those who do go down in a blaze. Let them have a slightly more lasting effect than just one scenario.</p>

His player saw this is the ultimate end to his character&#39;s arc and went for it. It remains a really memorable moment for everyone who was there.</p>

        <p>The only problem I see with the <b>Blaze of Glory</b> idea is that it gives nothing to the player in the interim. They may go five or six sessions before the right situation comes up, in which case there character isn&#39;t really growing/changing (at least not in the rules). But I <i>do</i> like the idea.</p>

Lots to work with there; it even gives me another idea:<br /><br />When a PC dies, their playbook is set aside. For the remainder of the adventure, any living PC who knew the character can use a Move from the dead PC&#39;s playbook as they recall some fact about their departed friend. Once a Move has been used in this way, it is crossed off and cannot be chosen again. Discard the dead PC&#39;s playbook at the end of the adventure.<br /><br />On second thought, this might get complicated what with spells and such...<br /><br /><span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink" href="https://plus.google.com/117869609164816132752" oid="117869609164816132752">Parker Emerson</a></span> True. <b>BoG</b> could simply be a Move made available to PCs who have reached 11th level. They&#39;d still choose one of the other options moving forward.</p>
