I&#39;m a huge fan of the intro blurbs on pages 6 to 9.  Does anyone know if there&#39;s an intro blurb for the Barbarian yet?<br /><br />How about for the awesome Mage or Artificer base classes from <span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink" href="https://plus.google.com/109415345416055594262" oid="109415345416055594262">Jacob Randolph</a></span> ? <a href="http://rpg.drivethrustuff.com/product/108623/Dungeon-World-Alternative-Playbooks" class="ot-anchor">http://rpg.drivethrustuff.com/product/108623/Dungeon-World-Alternative-Playbooks</a>

        <p>They&#39;ve been recently updated and are awesome!  The Templar is good fun, too!  Nothing like a drill instructor to hurry you into the dragon&#39;s lair!</p>

        <p>Perhaps this for the Barbarian:  Despite his brutish appearance, The Barbarian uses his brains as well as his brawn. The Barbarian is a talented fighter, but his travels have given him vast experience in other trades, especially as a thief; he is also a talented commander, tactician and strategist, as well as a born leader. In addition, The Barbarian speaks many languages, including advanced reading and writing abilities: in certain stories, he is able to recognize, or even decipher, certain ancient or secret signs and writings; for example, in &quot;Jewels of Gwahlur&quot; Howard states, &quot;In his roaming about the world the giant adventurer had picked up a wide smattering of knowledge, particularly including the speaking and reading of many alien tongues. Many a sheltered scholar would have been astonished at the Barbarian&#39;s linguistic abilities...&quot; He also has incredible stamina, enabling him to go without sleep for a few days. In &quot;A Witch Shall be Born&quot;, The Barbarian fights armed men until he is overwhelmed, captured, and crucified, and goes a night and a day without water, but still possesses the strength to pull the nails from his feet, then to hoist himself into a horse&#39;s saddle and ride ten miles.</p>

        <p>I save writing the blurb for the very absolute last thing, because so much of the tone is wrapped up in the moves and the moves have to be done for me to know the tone, after all!</p>

        <p>Was there ever an official blurb for the Barbarian? I just purchased DW from DTRPG and was surprised I didn&#39;t find one for the class.</p>
