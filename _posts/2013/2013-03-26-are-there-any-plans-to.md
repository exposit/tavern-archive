Are there any plans to curate the Monster Codex? It seems like there are roughly three kinds of entries: &quot;serious&quot; monster archetypes, &quot;silly&quot; monster archetypes, and specific NPCs. Perhaps just a field to categorize and filter the entries would be helpful? I know my DW isn&#39;t the same as your DW, but I&#39;d like to be able to filter out monsters that don&#39;t fit my style.

        <p>We&#39;re considering the best way to do that. Use tags? Categories? Algorithmic grouping?<br /><br />We didn&#39;t already have a better solution because we never expected it to be this successful! I had nightmares of everyone just not caring.</p>

        <p>Taxonomy is a complex subject that I&#39;m not intimately familiar with. Definitely worth crowdsourcing ideas. The tricky thing about tags is that no one knows what all the tags are! As for my contribution to this effort, I&#39;d like to see the following capabilities:<br /><br />Filter by where it resides (like in the DW manual)<br />Filter by &quot;official&quot; monsters endorsed by dev/mods<br />Other filters: silly, npc<br />A style guide for entries<br />The ability to flag entries<br /><br />If the site is written in Rails I&#39;d be happy to lend a hand.</p>

        <p>Tags would work best; you could tag serious, huge, Lovecraft, whatever. Most popular tags would become categories over time.</p>

        <p>Something where you could add to your list would be nice.</p>

        <p>Tags are definitely a good idea. The problem with a &quot;silly&quot; category is that there definitely will be (if there aren&#39;t already) some monsters that the creator (and maybe others) insists is serious while others are saying &quot;Really? No. Just no.&quot; (Which also makes a &quot;serious&quot; category or tag less useful.) So there may not be a practical way to filter those out, although there&#39;s no reason why creators shouldn&#39;t be able to tag their own creations &quot;silly&quot; or &quot;parody&quot; or whatever. <br /><br />Having a category for NPCs will definitely be needed.</p>

        <p>Having thought more about this issue, a simple per-entry &quot;hide&quot; feature may be the most efficient solution. Of course, there would need to be the ability to review hidden entries and &quot;unhide&quot; them. Also, &quot;hide/unhide all by this user&quot; would be a very helpful time saver.</p>

        <p>I think it would be nicer if it could add the monsters to your profile, maybe even under certain campaigns/</p>
