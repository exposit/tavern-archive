        <p>Yep, complete first time! I&#39;ve been reading through the play book the past couple of days and have been anxious to play. So glad I found this community on here, otherwise I would still be trying to find people to play my first adventure!</p>

        <p>Fun fact, a bunch of dim-witted jerks aren&#39;t great at investigating crimes.</p>

        <p>Hopefully they&#39;re at least entertaining at investigating crimes. :-)</p>

        <p>I hope you guys had fun. Fun little random Saturday romp turned in First Time Gaming, so I tried to stay on point. You guys were a blast, and even though I am sure I missed some move triggers, the engine got<br /> things done and then out of the way. <br /><br />I look forward to gaming with you all again soon!</p>
