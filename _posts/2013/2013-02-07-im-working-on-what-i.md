I&#39;m working on what I hope will be a booklet of monsters. While I anticipate releasing my work for free, I&#39;d like to at least leave open the option of charging a buck or two in the future. I had some questions about what creatures might (or might not) be permissible to use. <br /><br />I note that the DW rulebook includes a lot of monsters that were specifically created for D&amp;D, including some that were introduced in 3E (e.g. girallon, gray render). I also note that all D&amp;D monsters used appear in the d20 SRD, even though DW--as far as I know--isn&#39;t published under the OGL. <br /><br />Is the presumption that as long as a creature isn&#39;t considered WOTC product identity (e.g. beholder) it&#39;s fair game? Could I, for example, include the darkmantle?<br /><br />Also, what&#39;s the status of the Cthulhu Mythos monsters? While they&#39;re not in the d20 SRD, they are in the Pathfinder SRD, which further includes some that were not derived exclusively from Lovecraft (e.g. Hound of Tindalos). I don&#39;t see any attribution given to Arkham House or Chaosium in the Paizo legalese.<br /><br />I know, I know, the easiest way to avoid any problems to make up original monsters, but just as the original D&amp;D &quot;borrowed&quot; from every book, comic, movie and plastic toy available at the time, it&#39;s fun to stat up pre-existing critters.

        <p>I think you can&#39;t use non-SRD monsters, yeah. I remember this coming up when I stated up Mind Flayers a while back.</p>

        <p>Coming soon: THE BESTIARY OF FORBIDDEN MONSTERS: Mindflayers! Beholders! Slaad! Githyanki! Oh, wait, somebody already did that last one, hmmm.</p>

        <p>You can&#39;t call them Mind-Flayers. But you could have psychic squid-faced beings that eat brains, maybe.</p>

        <p>Yeah, I know to stay away from beholders and mind flayers. What I&#39;m getting at here is whether we&#39;re assuming that anything in the d20 SRD is fair game? I&#39;d thought that to use material from the SRD, you had to slap an Open Game License agreement on the final product. Is this just a case of &quot;we think no one&#39;s really going to worry about it if we just go ahead and put a stirge in our book?&quot;<br /><br />And the whole Cthulhu Mythos thing confuses me. Plenty of rules systems include references to specific Mythos entities, and I&#39;d be willing to bet that they don&#39;t all go through Arkham or Chaosium.</p>

        <p><i>Parts</i> of Lovecraft&#39;s works are now out-of-copyright, I believe. Hence the recent explosion of Mythos-related gaming. :)</p>

        <p>Names can never be copyright, and content can never be a trademark.  So the question of whether you can convert the mind flayer to DW turns on two factors: whether &#39;mind flayer&#39; is a valid trademark held by Wizards of the Coast, and whether you are copying Wizards&#39; content when you convert the mind flayer. <br /><br />Putting a monster into the SRD under the OGL is not a guarantee that Wizards doesn&#39;t have a trademark claim (the OGL is a pseudo-copyright licence, not a trademark licence) but it makes it a pretty good bet (for reasons I won&#39;t go into). So that explains the use of the names &#39;girallon&#39; and so on. <br /><br />However, unless you&#39;re using the OGL (and DW does not), you still can&#39;t copy the content -- whether it&#39;s a description of a mind flayer or of a girallon or of a donkey. So in terms of copyright law, you are in no better or worse position whichever monster you convert.<br /><br />This is not legal advice. I won&#39;t be a lawyer for another year and a half.</p>
