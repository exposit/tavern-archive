Further to the discussion <span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink" href="https://plus.google.com/102311180250681509880" oid="102311180250681509880">Patrick Joannisse</a></span>Â started about group moves, here is a covenant move I&#39;m working on for my Ars Magica hack:<br /><br />When the covenant sends a group of the most sociable grogs to a suitably large population centre to look for additional members, roll+Social. On a 10+ they recruit enough people to grow the population a bit (GM&#39;s call but usually about 10%). On a 7-9 the population grows and choose two:<br />They don&#39;t attract the wrong kind of attention.<br />They don&#39;t have to pay bribes costing 1 gold.<br />They don&#39;t have to resort to press-ganging.<br />On a miss most of the recruiters wind up abandoning the covenant (the population decreases a bit).<br /><br />For reference, 1 gold is about enough to feed a peasant family for a month.<br /><br />Any thoughts/feedback?

        <p>I always suggest omitting the &#39;miss&#39; result. The MC may have something much better mind, given the opportunity, and can always choose to have it be that grogs abandon the Covenant if they so wish.</p>

        <p>That&#39;s a good point. I was tied to the profit / catastrophe model from the Operator&#39;s gigs in AW but you&#39;re right - the MC might have something much cooler in mind.</p>
