A&#39;right, guys - let&#39;s talk about Tags.<br /><br />I&#39;m building fronts and beasties for my new campaign, and am (only mildly) confused by the loose tags for monsters.   Let&#39;s take <i>Messy</i>, specifically.<br /><br />I&#39;m working on an automaton - a sort of clockwork contraption of whirling blades that would essentially be tagged as <i>Stupid</i>, <i>Clumsy</i>, and <i>Messy</i>.  As I understand things, these tags essentially give me license to affect the fiction in ways that are appropriate to the tag.  That is, the beastie is intended to be <i>really dumb</i>; it lacks self-preservation, won&#39;t notice even obvious traps or ambushes, and would charge heedlessly at an enemy even with a gaping chasm filled with lava between themselves and their target.   Clumsy?  They&#39;re easy to knock over, prone to falling over, and don&#39;t handle things like stairs well.<br /><br />However, <i>Messy</i> has direct consequences to the players - getting hit by one of these things isn&#39;t a couple of clean wounds; it&#39;s more like running into a blender set on frappe&#39;.  I get how this works fictionally - how should I treat this systemically?<br /><br />Is this a matter of more hard moves for damage, with bigger consequences?    When do we maim or visit fictional consequences beyond damage?  Is the answer always &#39;when the fiction dictates it to be so?&#39;

        <p>It sounds like a cop out, but that&#39;s it right there.  If the monster didn&#39;t have messy and it hit a PC, you&#39;d be within your rights to narrate pain and blood but probably nothing that wouldn&#39;t heal up right.<br /><br />Messy means broken bones, torn flesh and nasty damage that sticks around.</p>

        <p>Messy is a description tag as well, wounds aren&#39;t simple cuts and bruises, they are open wounds with flesh torn around and apart, sometimes chunks missing, if they go unhealed they become ugly and so on. In my mind a messy monster&#39;s attacks are dangerous in an obvious way, you don&#39;t have a shred of doubt, and it is brutal.<br /><br />It is like watching an alligator attacking its prey, it is vicious and it is obvious.<br /><br />As for consequences beyond damage, the fiction surely has a say in it, but the players must be cool with it more than the fiction. I had a character that was blinded in D&amp;D 3.5 because in the fiction a war hero noticed my eyes were being used for scrying by the bad guys, I didn&#39;t doubt it was needed.<br /><br />I wouldn&#39;t be happy if it happened because a robot swung at me though, so it really depends on everyone&#39;s moods and dispositions. When it comes up in my game I will make an offer when someone gets a huge blow by a messy creature:<br /><br />You can take all that damage or you can choose to tell me HOW you go on after what happened, even giving a choice, if they take it, I ignore the damage and go with the fiction and fictional results, if they don&#39;t take it then I apply damage with descriptions but no larger overall impact.<br /><br />In the end I will have gauged them for how far are they accepting loss of part of their characters, and I don&#39;t mean members, I mean of how they envision them.</p>
