Is anyone out there doing a PBP (play by post) DW one shot? I would like something short just to get my feet wet with PBP and DW. Haven&#39;t played it yet but reading through the rules right now. <br /><br />I intend to run my own PBP with some friends but would like to participate in DW before being a GM.  Also would like to see how others do PBP, I intend to use google docs as it&#39;s got some awesome resources. <br /><br />Thanks for the feedback!

        <p>I&#39;m running a DW campaign via google docs at the moment.  If you wanted to jump in for a bit you could. </p>

        <p>We play DW PbP games over on <a href="http://www.gotexp.com" class="ot-anchor">www.gotexp.com</a>. I&#39;m running a DW and Dungeon Planet (DP) game there. Both have room for new PCs; however, we&#39;re also trying to get a new game of Grim World going. :)<br /><br />Come by and check it out, if you want!</p>

        <p>It&#39;s a DW/Fate supplement that recently had a Kickstarter: <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/trentish/grim-world-gaming-supplement-for-dungeon-world-and" class="ot-anchor">http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/trentish/grim-world-gaming-supplement-for-dungeon-world-and</a><br /><br />Basically DW, but darker and grittier. There are cool, new races and classes too.<br /><br />If you&#39;re not interested, I&#39;d still be up for getting another, regular game of DW going - unless any of you feel like GMing. :)<br /><br />Also, I&#39;ve never played DW with <span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink" href="https://plus.google.com/100537307520628832230" oid="100537307520628832230">dave ring</a></span> , but he can MC the crap out of Apocalypse World, I can tell you that. I&#39;m more than sure his DW game is awesome, as well. Actually, Dave, how many PCs are you capping it at</p>

        <p>Ha, you&#39;re kind to say so, Misha. <br /><br />The game&#39;s been ongoing for awhile, had sort of a flux of incoming and outgoing players.  So no cap exactly.  I&#39;ll invite you to the DW folder and you can see if you&#39;re into it.</p>
