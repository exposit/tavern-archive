Ended a short campaign yesterday. Made it interesting by giving them nearly unlimited power, but punishing them immensely for any fails.  They rolled surprisingly well. <br /><br />The wizard channeled a ritual to ascend the necromancer to godliness, but ended up going mad before his escape. <br /><br />The necromancer sacrificed his power to destroy the dark plane that threatened their native world, earning a royal position in the underworld. <br /><br />The paladin stood atop the corpse of a fallen nightmare lord as the plane collapsed around him, content that he&#39;d done his duty. <br /><br />The reclusive ranger was the only one who made it out without permanent harm, but would anyone believe him anyway? <br /><br />Fun stuff.
