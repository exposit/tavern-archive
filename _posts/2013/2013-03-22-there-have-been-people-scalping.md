There have been people scalping Dungeon World books. If you want a book, buy it from the source. Drops on Amazon on the 26th (no shipping outside US, though).<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Dungeon-World-Roleplaying-Game/dp/0988639408/" class="ot-anchor">http://www.amazon.com/Dungeon-World-Roleplaying-Game/dp/0988639408/</a>

Person HC = $65 each (yeah there was a shirt too). Merchant HC = $25 each (who then turned around and sold them for minimum $40 a pop.)<br />The next time Noble Knight Games gets their hands on a hardcover it&#39;ll be over $100 I&#39;m sure.<br />It&#39;s sadly just business, some people backed a project and now their investment is paying off. Good for them. No one is forcing anyone to buy off of ebay. I&#39;m just hoping my FLGS can order the book soon.</p>

It&#39;s scalping no matter what kind of mental gymnastics we do. If people want to go through a third party to get their stuff when they could get it first hand through the creators, great, that&#39;s their prerogative. They should know that there IS an option to get it from the creators though, which is why I&#39;m pointing it out.<br /><br />I backed the Kickstarter &quot;before it was cool,&quot; too, but I&#39;m not on here selling hardcovers on the community page.</p>

        <p>;) It&#39;s not scalping if it&#39;s sanctioned.<br /><br />Really, it&#39;s exactly what a FLGS does, except instead of spending loads on having a storefront you just sell on eBay. </p>

        <p>Yeah, I agree everybody should get the books and play, I just personally feel that marking up the book (like the one that went for $200 on eBay) is pretty shady. <br /><br />I personally would want to buy from a source such as the designers, FLGS, or other retailer, so I was just relaying the link for others like me.</p>

        <p>How exactly is selling your book on ebay Scalping? It&#39;s not like there was some condition on backing the kickstarter that you couldn&#39;t re-sell your books. Plus the people doing this are offering exclusive backer rewards you can&#39;t get anywhere else. I don&#39;t see any problem with this.</p>

        <p>I think that it totally is scalping. That money does not go to Sage and Adam. I&#39;m pretty bummed I won&#39;t be able to get those rad ass scout books, but that&#39;s a privilege of getting in on the kickstarter. I wish I could buy them from Sage and Adam, that would sit with me as more moral. Regardless, I&#39;m probably a bad example in that I have bought AW 3 times and already have purchased 2 DWs. I do these things gladly because I feel good content deserves money.<br /><br />Just my $0.02. Thanks for the heads up Kirby.</p>

So if you sell a copy of a 4e player&#39;s guide for a lot less than you paid for it then that is not scalping, but if other adults make a conscious decision to give you more than your starting bid and then the last bid is more than you original paid then you are scalping...I guess.<br /><br />I remember when scalping was a big event like the band Winger coming in concert :) and then people would maliciously buy up all the tickets to then resell them at ridiculous prices.<br /><br />Now scalping is supporting a nonexistent product and then when that non existent product becomes a reality selling it where the buyer decides how much they are going to pay?<br /><br />I bet all those people that were going to scalp Dwimmermount or any of the other dozens of failed kickstarters are pretty disappointed right now.</p>

Once someone outbids someone else it is no longer the price set buy the merchant. It is self-inflicted.<br />Is it a higher price than most would pay? Certainly.<br />But so is a lot of geeky stuff on ebay. I wouldn&#39;t mind a copy of Warhammer Quest, but it is always worth a lot more to someone else than it is to me. I&#39;m being outbid, not price gouged by another bidder.</p>

        <p>As someone who has engaged in far too many hobbies which involve some level of scarcity, I&#39;m very familiar with these arguments. In the world of collectible toys, the scalpers always justified their actions by declaring that buying up all the hard-to-find items and reselling them at a huge markup was actually doing us all a favor. It was b.s. then and it still is.<br /><br />That said, I will grant that there&#39;s one fundamental difference here. Participation in the Kickstarter wasn&#39;t limited; if you knew about it and had the money, you could buy a copy. These people are definitely profiteering, but at least they didn&#39;t remove copies from an already scarce supply to do so. <br /><br />It&#39;s still skeevy.</p>

        <p>:/ <br />I bought the PDF through DriveThru RPG and my FLGS has a copy being transferred from another store so I can get my hard copy as well but I have a friend who lives in Alabama who has played D&amp;D with us before. He looked into DW after seeing how excited I was about it and thinks it&#39;s a perfect system for him to try out as a new GM with new players. I was hoping to buy him a copy! Any update on when Amazon might be selling it again would be greatly appreciated! (Or any links to other reliable retailers in the US with decent shipping!) </p>
