 <a rel="nofollow" class="ot-hashtag" href="https://plus.google.com/s/%23WizardWeek/posts">#WizardWeek</a>   <br /><br /><b>RESEARCH</b><br />When you dedicate yourself to a research project (be it a new spell, the gathering of knowledge, the improvement of another spell or the creation of an artifact) write it down on your character sheet. The GM will tell you to create a research countdown matching the complexity of your project. They will also give you 1-3 other requirements you must fulfil from the following list<br />- You need to gather specific resources<br />- You need to gather information at this and that place<br />- You need the help of an expert on this subject<br />- You need to gather samples at a specific place<br />- You will need a week at the end to go over your notes again and puzzle it together<br />- It will cost you quite a fortune for components and books etc. <br /><br />The GM will also tell you 3 actions you can take to advance your Research Countdown. <br />For example to improve one of your spells these could be options:<br />- Fail at casting the spell<br />- Use the spell on something you never used it on<br />- Prepare nothing but that spell for the day (advances 2)<br /><br />When the countdown is filled up your research is complete and you may reap it’s fruit.

        <p>So is this an advanced move the Wizard would have to take or a Custom Move the GM present them with when they take the act in the fiction?</p>

        <p>I love this. Would you mind if I incorporate the basic concept into my Ars Magica hack?</p>
