 <a rel="nofollow" class="ot-hashtag" href="https://plus.google.com/s/%23bardweek/posts">#bardweek</a>     <a rel="nofollow" class="ot-hashtag" href="https://plus.google.com/s/%23compendiumclass/posts">#compendiumclass</a>   <br /><br />So, I decided that I would like to contribute to this class week, and I decided to do this with a CC ^^<br /><br />So, here goes! I&#39;m writing as I go along here ;)<br /><br />I think there&#39;s a lot of potential for making CC directly related to different kinds of performances, so I&#39;ll start making a &quot;Breakdancing Bard&quot;, just to completely break the mold!<br /><br /><b><i>Athosian Wardancer</i></b><br /><br />When you <i>have been tutored in the secrets of the wardancer</i>, you may take this move the next time you level:<br /><br /><b>Dazzling Wardance</b><br />When you <i>make the dance of war as a part of your arcane performance</i>, on a hit you can move between foes without endangering yourself and you get +1 hold next time you <i>defend</i> in this battle.<br /><br />Once you’ve taken “Dazzling Wardance,” the following moves count as class moves for you. In addition to your normal list of moves, you may choose from this list when you gain a level.<br /><br /><b>Air Flares</b><br />When you <i>make the &quot;air flares&quot; dance move</i> roll+CON. On a 10+ you can fly briefly and can carry a nearby ally into an advantageous position. Your GM will give you a choice between two such positions.<br />On a 7-9 you also get slightly dazed and take -1 forward as you vision keeps spinning for a while.<br /><br /><b>The Windmill</b><br />When you <i>make the &quot;windmills&quot; dance move</i> roll+CON. On a 10+ you create a wave of repulsion that will blow back any enemies at <i>close</i> range. On a 7-9 it goes out of control and you blow away all allies at <i>close</i> range as well. <br /><br /><b>Street Cred</b><br />Your mad dancing skills attract all the b-boys and flygirls in town. When you <i>make a street performance showcasing your latest and most difficult moves</i> roll+CHA. On a hit you attract a group of fans. On a 7-9 they can introduce you to some useful and influential people in the city&#39;s underground. On a 10+ one of the fans has some influence in the city&#39;s underground milieu and is willing to pull some strings for you.<br /><br />(<b>Street Cred</b> wasn&#39;t well-defined in this post originally. <span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink" href="https://plus.google.com/110330901807759406775" oid="110330901807759406775">Tim Franzke</a></span> got the idea of attracting fans.)<br /><br />Inspiration for dance moves from: <a href="http://list25.com/top-25-craziest-breakdance-moves/" class="ot-anchor">http://list25.com/top-25-craziest-breakdance-moves/</a>

        <p>when you spend some time in a city you amas a group of kids and rebelious teenagers that you can manipulate into doing things for you as long as you share your awesome dance moves with them?</p>
