        <p>I really need help with examples of this as well.  I really dislike making the characters look incompetent, so the idea of &quot;I want to turn into a bear&quot; and then making them turn into a bear cub instead because of a bad roll doesn&#39;t jive with me.  Even if you go that route, what do you require to allow them to change back?  It seems especially harsh to take them out of combat effectively for one or a few bad rolls, but maybe I just don&#39;t get it :)</p>

        <p>They transform but their equipment does not. It&#39;s hard to fly away as a falcon when you are trapped in your armor.</p>

        <p>While shifting into a bat: After his hold was used, the bat spirits were angered and he must first commune with some bats before being allowed to turn back into a bat.<br />While shifting into a horse: Couldn’t shift back for 2 days (spirits said he needed to learn ot be humble).<br />While shifting into a falcon: His arms changed into falcon-sized wings as he jumped into the air… and promptly landed on his face. He took damage as he hit the ground and had to spend a moment to realize what happened and fix it.<br />While shifting into a humming bird: He attracted the attention of a mean giant eagle that got in a shit-talking fight with him. The bird now stalks him and still sometimes causes him trouble when he shifts into birds or small prey.<br />While shifting into a deer: He was shot by a hunter.</p>

        <p>-They shift but the animal spirits are angered. Once you shift back to your regular form, you can no longer use Shapeshifting until you appease the spirits.<br /><br />-You shift but the animal spirit is fighting you for control of your physical shell (body).</p>

        <p>When you shift back or Shed, the animal spirit separates from you and becomes flesh, right here and now.  It is not pleased that you have called upon it&#39;s gifts.</p>

        <p>For all of the &#39;you can&#39;t shapeshift back till X&#39;, how do you handle them taking moves for that form?  They&#39;ve used up all their holds, so can they just no longer do the moves or do you let them?  Actually these types of &#39;hard moves&#39; against the player for rolling a 6- are the hardest ones for me to make.  It really penalizes the player, moreso than I think other hard moves I&#39;d make.<br /><br />I feel the same about not allowing them to shapeshift anymore until they do something.  That&#39;s one of the biggest powers of the druid, and taking it away unless the situation was really relevant seems harsh.<br /><br />I like the idea of not allowing them to change back into a particular shape because they&#39;ve angered the spirits - seems bad enough, without overly penalizing the players.<br /><br />Awesome ideas though, keep&#39;m coming!</p>

        <p>Either one.  Big archetype Bad version of the animal.  OR a spirit version.  Hell, or BOTH. Depends on the GM and the kind of fight they want and spirit shenanigans have been established in the fiction so far .  <br /><br />A Big Bad Dire Wolf is scary.  A spirit wolf that they need some kind of special weapon or something to fight is something else.  Consider it two different shades of the Hard Move =)</p>

        <p>The real use of Hold is a pacing mechanism for how often the Druid needs to make the Shapeshift roll.  When our Druid got stuck as a field mouse, I didn&#39;t give him any hold, I just let him do things that a field mouse would naturally be able to do and judged accordingly.<br /><br />If he had been shifting to a more capable shape, I probably would have chosen a different hard move.</p>

        <p>Lots of great ideas here, thanks.  Some I&#39;ve used:<br /><br />Partial transformation: you get a sort of human-animal hybrid with some but not all of the benefits of either.  And you&#39;re stuck with it for a few minutes (the duration of the fight in question).  If I used it again, I think I&#39;ll go with &quot;You get hybrid forms for all animals you go to for the rest of the day.&quot;)<br /><br />Residual effects: When you go back to human form, you look a lot like the animal you just were.  People look at you funny and gain Scarred for a day.</p>

        <p>On a roll of 3, I had my druid turn into a &quot;lamb&quot; rather than a &quot;ram&quot; and I gave him one move &quot;bleat helplessly&quot;.<br /><br />It was harsh, but it was his 5th or 6th transformation of the evening and his first miss. He still managed to ram a zombie in the legs on an assist.</p>

        <p>I tend to play up the animal nature overwhelming the druid&#39;s rational mind, or have the physical nature of the new shape screw things up. I&#39;m not overly keen on partial or failed transformations; I don&#39;t want the druid to be a laughing stock. I can see the occasional use working, just not as a regular thing.</p>

        <p>The transformation hurts. Take 1d4 stun damage/damage depending on the narrative.<br /><br />The transformation takes time.<br /><br />The transformation is painful. Take -1 ongoing on future transformations.<br /><br />The spirit form is overwhelmed by your human logic. You cannot call upon that particular animal form til your next night of rest.</p>

        <p>I didn&#39;t read this entire thread, but <span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink" href="https://plus.google.com/117415966179711277938" oid="117415966179711277938">Sage LaTorra</a></span> mentioned in a thread a few weeks ago, that a 6- on a shapeshift doesn&#39;t have the same rules as other moves.  The logic was that since the act of changing shape doesn&#39;t do anything to change the situation. You still have to attack the baddies, or sneak past the guards etc. Therefore the downside to a poor role on shapshift was that you didn&#39;t get much use out of your new shape. </p>

        <p>I have to agree that I like having the option to still allow shapeshifting to work, but at a cost.  Sort of like how the 7-9 stuff work for others.   So in a sense: 10+ is 3 hold, 7-9 is less hold, and 6 below is sort of like 7-9 result but with a cost.</p>

        <p>Ya, its hard to make the form less useful without making the Druid seem like the comic relief.</p>

        <p>It depends on how dangerous/risky Shape Changing is in your dungeon world.</p>

        <p>After all the discussion, I put together a list of what everyone said. I tried to include everything everyone said... but I changed some of them a bit to my taste and style. I hope this helps!</p>
