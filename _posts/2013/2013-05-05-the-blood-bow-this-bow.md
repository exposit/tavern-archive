<b>The Blood Bow</b><br />This bow was originally crafted for an ancient, unknown vampire lord, whose unlife was cut short by a travelling band of adventurers. While the bow does not use ammunition, it draws on the blood of its bearer to create it&#39;s arrows.<br /><br /><i>near, far, +2 damage, weight 1</i><br /><br />Whenever you <i>volley</i> with this bow, take 1 damage, ignoring armor. You can not spend ammo on a 7-9 result, but you may choose to take +1d4 additional damage, ignoring armor.

        <p>OK, the backstory is pretty bland, I know. It was the idea I went for. A powerful bow that hurts to use...</p>

        <p>I don&#39;t think it&#39;s bland at all. Only thing I think it&#39;s missing maybe it&#39;s what it looks like. Otherwise, in pretty ready to use this :-)</p>

        <p>I think it&#39;s the perfect amount of backstory. Neat item!</p>

        <p>For what it looks like, I&#39;d go with an old oak bow no string. When you &quot;pull&quot; it, blood leaks from your wrist, forming an arrow.</p>

        <p>Hey! I had a similar bow some time ago in a seafaring campaign for the ranger. Bow of the sea king, made of pearl and coral, with no string nor need for arrows that shoots water darts. It has 3 ammo within you can recharge any time immersing the bow in salt water. Also, it was good enough even underwater.</p>

But your version is incredibly flavorful :)<br /><br />I love the &quot;power isn&#39;t cheap&quot; angle on magic items. Let them be powerful enough that the heroes want them, but let them be just dangerous enough that they will think before they use it.<br /><br />Basically, I want magic items to be the epitome of <i>offer an opportunity with cost</i>.</p>
