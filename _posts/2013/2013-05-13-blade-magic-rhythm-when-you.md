<i>Blade Magic Rhythm</i> <br /><i>When you successfully cast a damaging spell, take half of it’s damage forward for your next melee attack. When you damage an enemy in melee, take half your damage forward for your next damaging spell.</i>  <br /><br />too much?

        <p>Not exactly but wouldn&#39;t a +1 to your next attack/spell telegraph the same thing? Maybe split it into four moves, +1 to spells after an attack, +1 to attacks after a spell, half damage to spells after attacks, half damage to attacks after spells.</p>

        <p>a +1 is hell of uninteresting though... 4 Moves is also way to much to incentivize a specific behaviour... </p>

        <p>and this is mostly designed to go on a Wizard. A fighter could probably still get to that but it would cost more. </p>

        <p>I think it needs more interesting triggers, for starters. Those don&#39;t really conjure up that much cinematic or thematic concepts other than just, &#39;guy who alternates between sword and spell&#39;.</p>

        <p>Well if you want a Wizard that can mix it up in melee you have 2 problems <br />- 1 they deal only a d4 of damage<br />- they have so little hitpoints <br /><br />So if you want to give them any reason to go into melee you need to make it so, that this actually creates an advantage for them. <br /><br />You could also go the route of the Arcane Duelist and give them extra stuff to do on an attack but someone already did this <br /><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/10FGRQNXa2pZBSwZeCxcFHNWxwfEn2H1C_SnyvQfzLwQ/edit" class="ot-anchor">https://docs.google.com/document/d/10FGRQNXa2pZBSwZeCxcFHNWxwfEn2H1C_SnyvQfzLwQ/edit</a> </p>

        <p>What about allowing them to follow up a successful attack with a spell? What about adding, &quot;Your target moves into melee range with you.&quot;, as a 7-9 option on casting a spell?</p>

        <p>There is an additional move that lets you cast a spell when you damage someone in melee</p>

        <p>I think you&#39;d be better off with a different class like warlock our something if you wanted to make a melee wizard. You&#39;re thinking of it too much like D&amp;D. Focus on the fiction first.<br /><br />What does spell-sword rhythm DO when you imagine a guy doing it in a movie? Is it good because its relentless? Them maybe something like:<br /><br />When you work up a rhythm of spells and slashes, battering your opponent onto the backfoot, forget one spell you have memorized and roll+INT.<br /><br />10+: Deal your damage and your opponent is stunned.<br />7-9: Your opponent is stunned, but you are put in a spot.</p>

        <p>Why does the Wizard need to be good at melee in addition to being good at everything else <i>and</i> getting spells?<br /><br />Why does the Wizard need to deal more than 1d4 damage to be good at melee?<br /><br />Why not make a CC that makes melee desirable for a Wizard via some effect other than just buffing their melee damage up to the same levels as classes who actually go into melee and aren&#39;t also Wizards?</p>

        <p>MANTLE OF ENERGY<br />When you cast a damaging spell you&#39;ve learned to make little bits of the magical energy stay with you. On a +10 when you can choose to take one of the 7-9 results you can also take half the damage forward to your next Hack and Slash or Volley attack. <br /><br />BLOOD MAGIC<br />When you have the blood of your target on your hands, take +1 to cast spells against them. </p>

        <p>Oooh, I like <i>Blood Magic</i>, <span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink" href="https://plus.google.com/110820867937238391587" oid="110820867937238391587">Kingston Cassidy</a></span>.  It incentivizes Hack and Slash for the Wizard.  It also adds some cool dark color to spells.</p>

        <p>and it&#39;s useful outside of hack and slash. Poke somebodies finger with a blade, then cast invisibility on them. Prick somebody with a pin, then cast Charm person. </p>

        <p>If you like Jacob Randolph&#39;s The Mage playbook, The Mage of The Tower is a good one for melee.  They are something of a Paladin Mage:<br /><b>The Tower</b><br /><b>Aligned:</b> Shield From Harm, Give Strength to the Weak, Iron and Steel<br /><b>Opposed:</b> Fleeing or Escaping, Using Magic for Your Own Gain</p>

        <p>New idea: (all different moves)<br /><br />When your blade is drenched in blood and you channel a spell through it take +1 to casting a spell <br /><br />When you have cast a damaging spell, it&#39;s energies resonate in your blade. When you harm someone with it, don&#39;t roll your class damage but the damage dice of the spell <br /><br /><br /><br /></p>
