Our latest adventure front, &quot;Trouble in Northamlet&quot; is now available on RPGNow. This one is inspired by the classic T1 AD&amp;D module though quite different in terms of story. It&#39;s also the first part of a trilogy of adventures. Hopefully we&#39;ll have part 2 out by the end of August.
