So, I ran a session of Dungeon World last night and it was a mixed bag. I am still trying to get into the flow of this game. I enjoy it, but there is an amount of flow that you have to have for it to...

        <p>Keep on running this. Many games are sub-par with only two players; for DW I think 5 is optimal.</p>

        <p>Thanks for the blog, it was a good read. I&#39;d love to try it out if you try running it again and I&#39;m available. Reading it, it definitely feels like an adjustment</p>

        <p>Actually, in my experience, DW often works better with fewer players. I&#39;m not sure I&#39;d be super enthusiastic about running it for more than 4. Definitely not more than 5.</p>

        <p>I cannot run any game over 4 people well. I am a bit ADD and the game tends to suffer.</p>

        <p>I didn&#39;t hit my stride running the game until about the third session.  I think I remember reading in the book that it will take you a few times running to get the hang of GMing (though players take to it much faster).<br /><br />Some of the best advice that I adopted after my first session was to focus on three of the GM Moves:  <br />+ Put someone in a spot<br />+ Show signs of an approaching threat<br />+ Deal Damage<br />Those 3 moves are still my main ones I use, though I&#39;ve gotten much more comfortable with:<br />+ Use up their resources<br />+ Offer an opportunity, with or without cost<br />+ Tell them the requirements or consequences and ask.</p>

        <p>Hey <span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink" href="https://plus.google.com/111111898558971712489" oid="111111898558971712489">Stacey Chancellor</a></span>  have you seen <a href="http://www.dungeon-world.com/dungeon-world-guide/" class="ot-anchor">http://www.dungeon-world.com/dungeon-world-guide/</a> ? It&#39;s a fan-written guide to getting &quot;the flow&quot; of DW, that you talk about in your article. I found the advice within invaluable.<br /><br />Actually I&#39;ve forgotten quite a bit of it since running other games. I think I&#39;ll have to read it again before my next DW session.</p>

        <p>I just got done running a Dungeon World game for 5 players (4 teenagers and one adult). It was interesting, but most certainly a more taxing game than if it had been 3 players.</p>
