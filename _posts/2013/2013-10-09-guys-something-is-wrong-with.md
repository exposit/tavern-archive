Guys, something is wrong with the animal companion bases.<br /><br />• Ferocity +2, Cunning +1, 1 Armor, Instinct +1<br />• Ferocity +2, Cunning +2, 0 Armor, Instinct +1<br />• Ferocity +1, Cunning +2, 1 Armor, Instinct +1<br />• Ferocity +3, Cunning +1, 1 Armor, Instinct +2<br /><br />Comparing the 1st and 4th options the ranger doesn&#39;t have a choice at all. He always will pick the last one.

        <p>Instinct puts up another Weakness the companion has. They get an extra weakness for a bit more ferocity.</p>

        <p>Instincts equates to amount of weaknesses the animal companion has. Also, if you look under the last option for Command:<br /><br />• ... and someone interferes with you, add its instinct to their roll.<br /><br />So the drawback to the last option is having the +2 instinct (as opposed to the other options); however, you do get +3 ferocity.<br /><br />Still, I don&#39;t agree that a Ranger would always pick the last one. To me, it also depends on what animal the companion is when picking its stats. </p>

        <p>Instinct is bad. They get +instinct to interfere and you have to take a second weakness. So an oft forgotten detail on a rare move and a purely narrative disadvantage. Arguably much better than the 1st option but there are totally downsides there.</p>

        <p>2 cunning however is really good. Extra training is really useful. It&#39;s not only for command. If you have guard training your animal can guard!</p>

        <p>I&#39;ve run into problems when running the Ranger - the animal companion seems like a handy proxy for the ranger to get to do things for in lieu of the PC - I find it runs into the old D&amp;D problem of the Druid getting &#39;extra actions&#39;  (i.e. the Wolf attacks THIS guy and attack the other one!)  it make sense in the fiction, but seems a little more powerful than I&#39;d like<br /><br />Also: why does the animal companion have armor? It stirkes me as odd that a thing without HP or play-like stats really needs to work with that.)<br /><br />Any pointers on how to run the animal companion &#39;properly&#39;?</p>

        <p>The AC has armor because you can use thei armor to protect yourself. <br />I wouldn&#39;t send my wolf against anything nastier then a goblin, you are setting yourself up for a golden opportunity.</p>

        <p>The Animal Companion is basically just a beefed up hireling, with weaknesses instead of costs.</p>

Are they afraid of something? Is there something that they&#39;ll attack on sight? Build on the answers to both help and hurt, as appropriate to the roll.</p>

        <p>Actually, seperating the ranger from his pet could be a pretty good move sometimes. Just don&#39;t do it too often as it quickly gets stale. And never force it; make it a difficult choice! On a <i>miss</i> you could ask the player if he wants to be separated from his pet or the party ;)<br /><br />I really think that the Animal Companion should be treated much like the Signature Weapon in that regard; it&#39;s a core part of what makes the ranger cool. Don&#39;t f*ck him over by taking it away too often.</p>
