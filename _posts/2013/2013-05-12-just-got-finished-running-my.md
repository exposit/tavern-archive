Just got finished running my nephew and his friend (12-year-olds) through a short DW-inspired scenario. Not having much on-hand besides minis and dice, I had them choose a mini, then asked a bunch of establishing questions. Turned out one of them was a warforged created by the other&#39;s wizard friend to protect him while he tried to kill the evil king. Warforged dogs were fought, the protector became the protected, and they eventually defended the wizard&#39;s tower by nearly decapitating a dragon. Oh, and the warforged character died in the process. All this from winging and rules hand-waving, but sticking to the general DW GM principles and the basic dice mechanics. Right now I&#39;m going to bed and I can hear them rolling dice in the other room, starting up another session.
