Dungeon World Playbook: The Prophet<br /><br /><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B99hPl0o50Y8a1BDanpneGVfblk/edit?usp=sharing" class="ot-anchor">https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B99hPl0o50Y8a1BDanpneGVfblk/edit?usp=sharing</a><br /><br />So +James May may have beaten me to the punch here, but I have been developing a class that was loosely based off of the Fortune Teller. I began playing this class in a campaign and was realizing what kinds of things I wanted to do that I was having trouble doing with that class.<br /><br />So, naturally, I made my own! I had quite a few more moves that I wanted to add, and may still do so. I was simply trying to still adhere to the one page move list.<br /><br />Would love to know what you guys think.<br /><br />Thanks to +Matt Smith, +James Etheridge, and +Tim Franzke for their constructive feedback. ﻿

        <p>I already realize that - a &quot;moment&quot; - should be replaced by simply moment. But that&#39;s just syntax that I will fix.</p>

        <p>Cool to see the different approaches you have taken to some of the same kinds of &quot;story beats.&quot; I especially like A Slightly Less Perilous Journey and A Much More Interesting Journey. Nice in-fiction upgrades on the standard move, without having to add a bunch of bonuses. One of the interesting things about writing a class like this is finding places where just giving more information and more opportunities can provide a meaningful benefit.<br /><br />I also think that 7-9 option on Road Less Traveled is quite cool. I like that you can get the bonus if you deal with the difficulty, or you can accept a penalty and not face the difficulty.</p>

        <p>Moment in Time... a move that feeds on rations!? ^_____^</p>

        <p>Blood of the damed. By using the blood or body part of a slay evil creature you can see there plans from their pov. Side effect is you on a fail will be knocked out. On a success you gain soke knowleage. On a extreme success you channel that being.</p>

I wanted a way to replenish the move resource on a regular basis without using only moment. This way the player runs out of the resource and will have to forage or renew it in town. ﻿i feel like i never use rations in games anyways, so put them to use!</p>

        <p>What abut using gold. You complete a task get paid and the spend the money on things you need to reset movements?</p>

        <p>Not bad, but I wanted to use something that could be replenished in the wild as well, such as foraging for food/rations.</p>

        <p>I&#39;m not very sold on the moves without ruling to &quot;manage&quot; the fiction, ie Tell Fortune. How can you manage player tell another one &quot;You&#39;ll die today, I see it&quot;. Also, just telling &quot;I see great gold coming your way&quot; could be tricky, even with a murky result. Dunno.</p>

        <p>I agree with that move in particular. I think that it could use a bit more meat to it.</p>

        <p>Update to the playbook. I think I am about 95% happy with it as it stands, so feel free to use it!<br /><br /><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B99hPl0o50Y8a1BDanpneGVfblk/edit?usp=sharing" class="ot-anchor">https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B99hPl0o50Y8a1BDanpneGVfblk/edit?usp=sharing</a></p>

        <p>So looking back at the ration use, I&#39;m not quite satisfied with it, but I am not sure what else I could use to replenish those debilitations. Any ideas? I would want something that takes effort to collect, but not so difficult as to make the move a burden to use.</p>

        <p>Maybe make the debilities apply &quot;until you get a few hours of sleep&quot;? That would make it sort of a once-a-day, or once-per-camp, effect. I guess the drawbacks would be 1) it enforces a pace on the use of the move that rations don&#39;t, and 2) it removes the cost in coin.<br /><br />About Moment in Time: what made you want it to be a move that grants hold? The pick-from-a-list-of-buffs structure of it reminds me of the Bard and Arcane Art, where you have to risk a roll every time you want an effect. Did you consider that as a model?</p>

        <p>Yea, i was picturing the move as such that as when you&#39;re able to see the near future, you see various things happening at once. I don&#39;t want it to be a roll where the player has to say, &quot;ok, but before he does that, let me roll to see if i can sense what will happen&quot; and then aide. If you have a hold, you have seen the events happen all at the same time around you and anticipate what it is that is coming, so spending a hold, for me, is more applicable.<br /><br />I like the condition idea. I was already toying with making it only one debilitation of the GM&#39;s choosing that has to be fixed in the normal way a condition is resolved. That way each use is essentially a small penalty and you can decide how much you want to penalize yourself, although you have to get it fixed on your own time.</p>

        <p>Made a few adjustments. New move and a change to Moment in Time - some updated wording in other moves as well.</p>

        <p>I purchased the final playbook, but was curious about the previous iterations (as I had a player spamming Moment all session). Could you please re-share?</p>
