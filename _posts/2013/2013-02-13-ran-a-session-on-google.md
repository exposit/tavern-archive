Ran a session on Google+ Hangouts last night. Had two players. During character creation I asked 2 questions of each character in the following order:<br /><br />Wizard: Why are you an adventurer?<br />Thief: Why are you hanging out with this Wizard?<br />Thief: Name a city and tell me which crime they found you guilty of which will result in your execution should you ever return?<br />Wizard: What do you think of children?

        <p>Wizard was sent by his mentor to recover powerful Stones.. Thief likes to lead an interesting life and the Wizard provides that. I can&#39;t remember the city, but the Thief tried to steal a Power Stone (which may have been fake) that was considered a religious relic from the city&#39;s church.<br />The Wizard thinks children are interesting.</p>
