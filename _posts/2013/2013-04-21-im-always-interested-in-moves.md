I&#39;m always interested in moves that flesh out the campaign world. The Storysmith is a compendium class I put together in that spirit. It requires a fair amount of creativity, but in the hands of the right player, I think it could be a lot of fun.

        <p>looks fun!<br />Yes, it&#39;d work better with an active, creative player... then again, what wouldn&#39;t? ;)</p>

        <p>This is very cool, particularly Enchanting Narrative.</p>

        <p>I&#39;m thinking of collapsing Compelling Narrative into Teller of Tales somehow (only because it seems less cool than the other moves). I will likely replace it with something else--I have some thoughts, but am always open to suggestions. </p>
