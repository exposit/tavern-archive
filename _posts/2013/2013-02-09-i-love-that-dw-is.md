I love that DW is currently the #4 hottest product on DriveThruRPG.com right now. <br /><br />What I love even more is that DW is bookended by the #3 and #5 games, which just happen to be the original 1981 D&amp;D Basic and Expert rulebooks.<br /><br />That&#39;s must be some sort of ironic poetic justice...or something. <br /><br />Congrats!!!
