Bonds<br />So...we were wondering if characters can take on additional Bonds during End of Session or leveling up. I don&#39;t mean replacing an existing Bond. Apologies if this has been covered here before.

        <p>I allow it but only one new bond at a time and only if they didn&#39;t resolve or abandon any bonds. Not sure how it is in the rules but thats how we handle it.</p>

        <p>In addition to the number they have listed? No I wouldn&#39;t, the number of bonds is considered a feature of the class. Wizard have fewer and bards have more compensating for other abilities and niches.</p>
