Played my first game of  <a rel="nofollow" class="ot-hashtag" href="https://plus.google.com/s/%23DungeonWorld/posts">#DungeonWorld</a>  last night, via  <a rel="nofollow" class="ot-hashtag" href="https://plus.google.com/s/%23Roll20/posts">#Roll20</a>   and had a great amount of fun despite dice that conspired with extreme prejudice  against my poor Dwarven Necromancer. Kudos to all involved in both DW as a game and our adventure!

        <p>Were you using the Necromancer from Grim Portents? I&#39;d be really curious to hear what you thought of it.</p>

        <p>I was, yes.<br /><br />I&#39;m afraid I can&#39;t give a complete review as I have yet to collect any Souls  with which to use my nifty and flavourful abilities and - due to my own choices in the opening fiction - I began the game sans gear. I then proceeded to roll no higher than a 6 for the bulk of the gameplay that followed, which pretty much meant that my character was ineffective despite having cool abilities.<br /><br />We&#39;re scheduled to play again in a week, so I can hopefully offer a better opinion at that point. :D</p>

        <p>I&#39;ve actually got an updated version, as the one in the magazine needed some playtesting. <a href="https://docs.google.com/file/d/0BwTCs6XWNfLMWVVranlxSVFpQ2s/edit?usp=sharing" class="ot-anchor">https://docs.google.com/file/d/0BwTCs6XWNfLMWVVranlxSVFpQ2s/edit?usp=sharing</a></p>

        <p>I very much prefer the updated version to the original, tho I don&#39;t have a huge basis for comparison as yet.</p>

        <p>Thanks, I dig the new one more as well. I was too focused on mechanical effects for the first draft.</p>

        <p>After a bit of thought, my only complaint was with the Bonds listed on the original sheet. Not that they were bad, but as a newbie I would&#39;ve preferred a few more options.</p>

        <p>Like, there were only 3? I kind of figured that since they&#39;re mostly interacting with spirits, that they wouldn&#39;t have that many bonds with others</p>

        <p>There&#39;s some truth in that, I&#39;ll admit. Looking at the moves on the recent version though, how about adding something like:<br /><br />I once bound an ancestor of <i>__________</i>  to my service.</p>

        <p>Yeah, feel free to add that in if you feel it needs another Bond.</p>

Every starting move came into play except Vampiric Touch (I was at full health), and seemed useful/appropriate as applied.<br /><br />One thing I&#39;d like clarification on: I bound 2 souls (my max) using <b>Last Rites</b> early in the session. A scene or so later I had need of <b>Secrets of the Dead</b>, rolled an 11, absorbed one of my bound souls and made use of the resulting Hold to distract an enemy engaging one of my companions.<br /><br />Is that soul considered &quot;Used&quot; or &quot;Spent&quot;, leaving me with 1 still bound, or are they only consumed when a move (such as <b>Soul Magic</b>, or a partial success using <b>Vampiric Touch</b>) specifically says &quot;Spend 1 Soul&quot;?</p>

        <p>When you use it for <b>Secrets of the Dead</b>, it&#39;s also spent.</p>

        <p>That was my assumption, thanks for clarifying. Might be something to specifically state in a further playbook revision, as it seems open to interpretation.<br /><br />All in all, fun class so far!</p>
