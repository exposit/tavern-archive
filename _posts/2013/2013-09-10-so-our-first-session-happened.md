So our first session happened Saturday night, and the group really loved it. It was really more of a learning session for all of us, as neither the players or the GM (me) had any experience with the rules.<br /><br />The group is already clamoring to play again! Here&#39;s the audio from the first session if anyone wants to listen to the growing pains. :D<br /><br />Though be warned, there&#39;s definitely adult language.<br /><br /><br />Also, as a GM listening to this I see many spots where I missed opportunities or didn&#39;t play the rules properly. If you have any suggestions to make the game better for my players please let me know. Thanks!!

        <p>The levels on this are a bit low, but otherwise that&#39;s a pretty great AP.<br /><br />Most of the playbooks in this are <span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink" href="https://plus.google.com/105004837996196022135" oid="105004837996196022135">Jacob Randolph</a></span>&#39;s (Witch, Artificer and Templar; the Spellslinger isÂ <span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink" href="https://plus.google.com/113847025671240258531" oid="113847025671240258531">Adrian Thoen</a></span>&#39;s), for anyone wondering.</p>

        <p>Yeah we were playing outside on a deck so there was a pretty good bit of background noise. We&#39;ve got a new player this Saturday and I think she&#39;s leaning towards the Dashing Hero.</p>

        <p>I personally can&#39;t wait for the next one. What kinda recording equipment are you using?</p>

        <p>Thanks a bunch Brandon! The next session is this Saturday. I&#39;m using a Yeti microphone from Blue that connects into my Macbook Pro and records using Audacity. Pretty simple actually.<br /><br />We&#39;ll be playing inside this next time too so the sound quality should be better.</p>

        <p>The quality was actually fine, it&#39;s just that everyone except Heather was pretty quiet - you should actually be able to boost the levels globally using Audacity fairly easily, which would fix that.</p>

        <p>I&#39;m pretty sure it&#39;s more that she was physically closer to the mic than the rest of you guys. :P</p>
