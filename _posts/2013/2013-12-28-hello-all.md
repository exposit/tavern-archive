Hello all.  I am trying to wrap my head around Parley and the use of counteroffers... I was thinking about the archetypal situation of trying to bribe a bouncer.<br /><br />PC: I offer 20 coin to the bouncer to &quot;find&quot; me on the guest list.<br />GM: Beefgate the Bouncer eyes your coin.  This seems like a Parley, roll for it.<br /><br />On 6-, I understand all sorts of fun things could happen, because the GM gets to make a move.  Maybe the bouncers take the PC out back and beat him.  Or toss him into a canal.  Or embarrass him in front of his date.  Or, more deviously, maybe the bouncers let in the hapless PC but alert the Big Bad Evil Guy (tm).<br /><br />On a 7-9, I understand that the Bouncer will do what the PC asks, but will demand &quot;concrete assurances.&quot;  I guess this means that he wants the 20 coins right now, and he lets the PC in.<br /><br />On a 10+... I assume the Bouncer will still want those 20 coins right now, because it follows from the fiction.  Which makes a 7-9 result here identical to a 10+.  I mean, I could imagine a result on a 10+ where the Bouncer just likes the cheek of the PC so much that he lets him in for free, but that strikes me as diminishing the importance of the leverage.<br /><br />What I am getting at is how to better make distinctions between 7-9 and 10+, or &quot;concrete assurance&quot; versus mere &quot;promise.&quot;  And is there room for something like a counteroffer?  Suppose on the 7-9, instead of &quot;concrete assurance&quot; of the 20 coins waved under his nose, the Bouncer comes back with a request for 30 coins?  Or would that kind of counteroffer be more appropriate as a GM move, in the event of a 6- roll?<br /><br />Anyway these are just head experiments, I have relatively little DW game experience under my belt at this point.  So how do you handle Parley?  Do you have awesome Parley stories to share?  I genuinely think it is an awesome mechanic, I&#39;m really just trying to understand it better.

        <p>With parley I sometimes treat it as &quot;open negotiations&quot; instead of just &quot;demand something now&quot;. I let the fiction dictate which one I use.  Otherwise I don&#39;t find any problems.</p>

        <p>If you have 20 coins and the bouncer wants them, it&#39;s not even a parley - you don&#39;t have leverage, you have a bribe. If they don&#39;t want those coins or they&#39;re not sure, you can leverage the coins and the promise can be that you don&#39;t tell anyone what a piss-poor bouncer they are. Concrete assurances could be &quot;ten now, ten when I leave and you&#39;ll never see me again&quot;.</p>

        <p>I typed out this whole long response and then realized there&#39;s a very simple answer.<br /><br />On a 10+, the NPC does what you ask <b>if you first promise to do what they ask</b>. In this case that means the bouncer will let the PC in, so long as the PC promises to give them the 20 coins once they are inside.<br /><br />On a 7-9, the NPC needs some concrete assurance <b>right now</b>. In this case that means the PC has to hand over a few coins now, before they get inside, and is expected to hand over the rest once they actually are inside.<br /><br />Of course, whether the PC actually pays the bouncer after they&#39;re inside is completely up to them. ;)</p>

        <p>The fact that with a 10+ you don&#39;t <i>have</i> to keep your promise doesn&#39;t mean that, if you do, you&#39;re losing something or wasting a good roll.<br /><br />The paladin in my games always goes for parlay and <i>always</i> keeps his word.<br /><br />In other words: a 10+ on parlay is, at the very least, a measure to see what the character is made of.<br /><br />Specific to the example you made: you don&#39;t promise 20 coin, you promise &quot;big gold&quot;. On a 10+, even if you you give him a coin purse filled with marbles, he will not count the money <i>right now</i>.</p>

        <p>Hell, you don&#39;t even have to keep your word on a 7-9 either. You just have to give the NPC something to make them <i>think</i> that you will.<br /><br />Example A: PC says &quot;I&#39;ll give you this bag of gold if you let me in.&quot; They get a 10+ on Parley, and so the bouncer lets them inside <i>then</i> holds out their hand for payment. The PC can then say &quot;Yeah, I lied. But thanks for letting me in.&quot; They just have to deal with a pissed off NPC.<br /><br />Example B: PC says &quot;I&#39;ll give you this bag of gold if you let me in.&quot; They get a 7-9 on Parley, and so the bouncer holds out his hand for some kind of payment now. The PC gets in if they drop a few coins. After getting in the PC can still say &quot;Yeah, I lied.&quot; just like on a 10+, but here they are out a few coins.</p>

        <p>Bouncer: Yer not on da list.<br />PC: What would it take to get in the list? <br />Bouncer: Howzabout 10 gold.<br />PC: Eh. Okay fine. But I don&#39;t carry that much on me. Can I bring it tomorrow?  (Rolls 9)<br />Bouncer: Gold in my hand or you ain&#39;t gettin in.<br />PC: Tell you what, 2 now, and the rest tomorrow? Here, at noon.<br />Bouncer: Three now. And you better not stiff me... this is a small town.</p>
