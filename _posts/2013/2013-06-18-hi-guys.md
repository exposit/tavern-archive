Hi guys! I know there was some discussion here about last breath, and the fact that you don&#39;t always get to roll it: specifically, you roll it when you&#39;re dying, not when you&#39;re totally fucked up. You know, instantly decapitated, tossed in a river of lava, and so on. Can someone help me fetch it, or give me confirmation about this?

        <p>I remember <span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink" href="https://plus.google.com/117415966179711277938" oid="117415966179711277938">Sage LaTorra</a></span>  (I think) said that he has them make the Last Breath roll <i>before</i> the death is narrated.  Which is brilliant if you want to actually allow them the roll.  (And, you know, not be a dick.)</p>

        <p>Actually, I think I was the one who said the thing in the OP, not the brilliant thing. <br /><br />It&#39;s all in the trigger: when you&#39;re dying. Not dead, but dying. If you never really get into a dying state (head cut off, for example), I think the move doesn&#39;t trigger. <br /><br />Of course some of that depends on how you judge he fiction, and what Death is in your game.</p>

        <p>that was exactly what I was asking for. Thank you very much!</p>

        <p>As I understand it, the move triggers when you are still alive, but not for long. You don&#39;t roll the move for that instant that separates life from death.</p>

        <p>I tend to read it as dying as in &quot;death is imminent, but not guaranteed.&quot; That&#39;s not the only way to read it. I&#39;m not sure if that&#39;s a good thing or not.</p>
