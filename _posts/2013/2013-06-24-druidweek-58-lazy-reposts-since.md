 <a rel="nofollow" class="ot-hashtag" href="https://plus.google.com/s/%23druidweek/posts">#druidweek</a>  : lazy reposts since it&#39;s Monday, but some people might not have seen these yet:<br /><br /><b>New Druid racial moves</b>:<br /><br /><b>Dwarf</b><br />You are born and bred of stone. In addition to any other attunements, <b>the Towering Mountains</b> are always considered your land.<br /><br /><b>Orc</b><br />You are at the top of the food chain. When you <b>change your shape into that of a predator</b>, you deal +2 damage.<br /><br /><b>New Druid alignment moves</b>:<br /><br /><b>Lawful</b><br />Prevent others from interfering with the natural order.<br /><br /><b>Evil</b><br />Subvert the natural order to serve your whims.

        <p>Air Soul Genasi<br />The form of Birds and other flying animals come naturaly to you, when you Shapechange into something that has wings, you get an extra hold but you can only spend it on the &quot;fly away to safety&quot; move.</p>

        <p>That last restriction is a really bad idea, since not every creature with wings has that move. It should just be &quot;When you change your shape into something that has wings, gain an extra hold.&quot;<br /><br />Also works for raptorans, winged elves, etc.</p>

        <p>argh yeah. I kinda wanted to imply that they also get that move. Would this be clearer:<br /><br />you get an extra hold you can always spend on the &quot;fly away to safety&quot; move.﻿<br /><br />Just getting extra hold would be easier though, also more powerfull.</p>

        <p>With that phrasing, they get n hold that they can spend on any of their monster move, and 1 hold that they can spend on any of their monster moves or on the &quot;fly away to safety&quot; move (even if their form doesn&#39;t have it).<br /><br />With the basic +1 hold, they get n+1 hold they can spend on any of their monster moves, but they don&#39;t get a free dodge unless their form has the &quot;fly away to safety&quot; move.<br /><br />The latter is less powerful.<br /><br />You could also go for something like &quot;when you change your shape into something that has wings, you always have access to the &#39;fly away to safety&#39; move&quot; (no extra hold).</p>

        <p>When you change your shape into something that has wings, you always have access to the &#39;fly away to safety&#39; move and can use it once (per shapechange), without spending hold?<br /><br />I&#39;m also sorry for derailing your post</p>

        <p>Honestly, that&#39;s starting to get a little complicated for a racial move. My preference is for the +1 hold if it has wings option since it&#39;s simple.</p>

        <p>Not sure I like the druid subverting the natural order, even when evil. How about &quot;Use the natural order to serve your whims&quot;</p>

        <p>Ratkin - Your people have a very good attunement with different kinds of Vermin. You may always take the shape of Vermin in addition to your other options.</p>

        <p>Maybe a reword of evil to be Evil -  exemplify the cruelty of nature&#39;s wrath</p>
