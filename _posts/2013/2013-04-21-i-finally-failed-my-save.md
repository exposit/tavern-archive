I finally failed my save vs. &quot;Buy yet another dungeon crawling RPG&quot;. Still waiting for the actual book, but eagerly reading the epub version on my phone.<br /><br />This group seems to be an awesome resource for fledgling DW DMs.<br /><br />I just hope I can convert my gaming group. They like dungeon crawling, but aren&#39;t very fond of AW. And the gamers I know who like AW don&#39;t seem to like dungeon crawling very much.

        <p>I had a very resistant player, after the first season he was willing, after the third he was excited.<br /><br />Make sure you follow the first session advice, this will help sell the game to your players.</p>

        <p>It&#39;s hard to go back to other RPGs after you&#39;ve dug in with Dungeon World. Trust me: one session with some willing players is ALL you need.</p>

        <p>Yeah we had the wrong group for AW  but I&#39;ve yet to have a bad or even just OK game of dungeon world.</p>

        <p>DW does a pretty good job of selling itself— I&#39;ve converted two Pathfinder groups so far plus a few of my friends who are absolutely new to RPGs. DW seems particularly great with a mix of vets and newbs.</p>

        <p>The great thing about DW is that it allows much more than just dungeon crawling.</p>

        <p>I would suggest not framing it as &quot;converting.&quot; Instead, run something like a mini-series to show off the system. If you know that dungeon crawling won&#39;t be a big selling point, focus on the narrative control features and partial success system.</p>

        <p>With groups familiar with other games, I&#39;ve asked &quot;Tell me about the last time we played AD&amp;D / Pathfinder / 4e&quot; and listened to them reminisce.  They&#39;ll tell me about the amazing adventure they had - enemies battled with aplomb, daring chasm leaps, that last minute genius idea that saved the party.  I&#39;ll note, when they&#39;re done, how they didn&#39;t remember the <i>rules</i> but what actually happened in the game, to the characters.  They remember the fiction.<br /><br />Then I say &quot;want to try a game that feels like that <b>when you play</b>, not just afterward?&quot; and usually it&#39;s an easy sell from there.</p>

        <p>Lots of good suggestions. Thanks. Also: I tried to make my group tired of Moldvay, so today I killed of 75 percent of the party...</p>

We 2-rounded a CR 9 black dragon and got like 10k in lewtz!&quot;<br /><br />Funny thing is, when I play DW with those people (and I include myself in this camp), nobody cares about how much damage they do or the value of the loot they get. Different systems set different expectations. I don&#39;t think there are &quot;Narrative people&quot; and &quot;Crunch people...&quot; Just open-minded or close-minded to new systems!</p>

        <p>I don&#39;t think converting a campaign is necessary or recommended depending on what your players like about the game you are playing. Narrative games have a certain feel and limitations beyond just having less crunch.<br /><br />For me DW wont be my only game or a longer campaign game. This has as much to do with my problems with D&amp;D as well as the few flaws I have with DW.<br /><br />However DW excels as a pick-up game when there wasn&#39;t time to prep or not everyone can make the regular game. Before DW I would say Spirit of the Century was my favorite pick-up, but it has a bigger learning curve. This can be up and running in minutes.<br /><br />Instead of trying convince everyone to convert a current game to it maybe just try Dungeon World as a one shot.</p>
