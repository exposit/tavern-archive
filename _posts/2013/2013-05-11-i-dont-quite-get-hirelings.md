I don&#39;t quite get hirelings. I understand that the GM gets a certain number if points to distribute among a main skill, any number of secondary skills, loyalty, and cost. It says you can distribute between 1 and 10 points. Why do they get such a high potential modifier? How does cost work?

        <p>&quot;Why do they get such a high potential modifier?&quot;<br /><br />I&#39;m not sure I follow. They can have up to 10 points spread between loyalty and various skills, but that&#39;s like The Best Hireling Ever. Probably has quite a cost attached.<br /><br />Cost works like an agreement with a real person: they want X (money, fame, etc.). You need to pay them with it regularly (once a session is a good rule of thumb). What exactly counts as paying it depends a lot on the hireling, the characters, and the setting. A minor priest who heals the party and craves fame within his order won&#39;t care two bits if the ale hall toasts him, we wants fame within his order. The poor village warrior will probably take a few coin as happy payment, but the skilled mercenary will ask for more (there some suggested costs for various jobs in the equipment chapter).</p>

        <p>It says in the book that each hireling skill has a value from 1 to 10 (page 34). I&#39;m just wondering why the range is so great.</p>

        <p>Because otherwise an Adept could never help with a 9th level spell, a Priest could barely heal, and a Tracker wouldn&#39;t be able to take you all that far.<br /><br />Keep in mind that a hireling with a skill at 10 has (by default) no loyalty and no secondary skills. They&#39;re likely to turn on you unless you really do what they want, and they&#39;re only good at one thing. You had to recruit them from a major city, and they&#39;re basically the best help you can get. Sure, for somethings that&#39;s very powerful (+10 damage from a man-at-arms) but you&#39;ve essentially found the best hired sword there is, I&#39;d expect him to be potent.</p>

        <p>Okay. I can grok that. Thank you. Those questions have been burning a hole in my head for months.</p>
