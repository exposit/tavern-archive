I&#39;ve been having a random thought on dueling - as in a formal combat rather than general hank and slash.  (Warning very heavily inspired by LO5R)<br /><br />Challenged chooses to start or not.<br />first character chooses a difficulty up to 5<br />Second character can either raise by up to 5 or allow the first character to roll.<br />This continues until one of the characters allows the other roll.<br />Roll 2d6+ level if higher than the difficulty then a hit is made and damage is normal character level + difficulty.<br /><br />If the character misses the other character then rolls against their highest bid, if successful the damage would be normal base  + difficulty.<br /><br />If both fail then they both inflict their normal basic class damage (no modifiers, ignore armour).<br /><br />At this point the one hit can choose to offer an apology, surrender etc otherwise they will reset for another round.  If both fail it will take both to agree to reset for another round<br /><br />This of course will lead to a compendium class that will specialise in dueling.....

        <p>DW handles PvP very differently from PvNPC.  Is this system for PvP or for PvNPC?</p>

        <p>I am mainly looking at PvNPC, I try to steer players from attacking each other if possible as it just causes the wrong kind of diversions generally in my experience. <br />Dueling could easily include jousting, calling up eldritch forces, good old fashioned swords at dawn etc</p>

        <p>FYI, NPCs aren&#39;t going to have a &quot;level&quot;, though they could have a skill in Duelling.</p>

        <p>Ahh my history of Lo5R comes back to bite my posterior - in Lo5R the NPC is<br />usually the same &#39;level&#39; as the player, some times top end of level below,<br />some times bottom end of the level above.<br />I will need to revisit this ;-)</p>

        <p>When you <b>engage in a duel</b> roll+level.  On a 12+, you slay your opponent (regardless of your intentions).  On a 10-11, you defeat your opponent and choose 2:<br />+ Opponent is humiliated.<br />+ Opponent is mortally wounded.<br />+ Opponent (and/or opponents family) will not seek vengeance.<br />On a 7-9, you choose 1 and the GM chooses one to apply to you.</p>

        <p>That is a coll idea - I&#39;m kind of wanting to have a duel last longer than one dice roll to cover the whole event, but I definately need to look at this again, as I really like the tension of deciding when to go for the roll vs hoping the other side fails letting you in....</p>
