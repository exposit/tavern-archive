Ran the second session in our sporadic <b>Dungeon Planet</b> campaign, it really is just crazy amounts of fun.  Highlights:<br /><br />-Vinca the Mutant&#39;s Unstable Mutation roll causing her to become temporily male.  Further complications included being singled out by the monarch of the White Fortress to wed the Princess Alyra.  The Chaotically aligned Vinca did not pass up the opportunity to make trouble.<br /><br />-The Evil Technician, Garth, after finally gaining control of his foe&#39;s phalanx of detached, murderous robotic hands, turns them on their master.  Garth&#39;s player then dropped the following line and broke into classic mad scientist laughter.<br />&quot;I guess now, you&#39;ll die by your own...hands!&quot;

        <p>Garth&#39;s player surely deserved to mark xp for that one. :)</p>

        <p>Heh, yeah he did.  Also, he now has a posse of robot murderhands, so that&#39;ll be interesting.</p>

        <p>Puns in my home games are rewarded with laughs and punished with death threats.  Often simultaneously.</p>

        <p><b>When you make a terrible, terrible  joke at Adam&#39;s table</b>  roll + PUN, with PUN equal to the amount of groans elicited from players...</p>
