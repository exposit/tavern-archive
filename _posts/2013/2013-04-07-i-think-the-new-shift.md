I think the new shift by some, to move away from race moves and alignments in favor of backgrounds and motivations is great!  Has anyone considered having advanced moves for backgrounds?  They could be based on social class, geographic or other cultural backgrounds which would offer some moves independent of class.  Maybe they could even run in parallel with class, meaning that, for example, you might have separate XP for class and background.  You could be a 5th level thief/3rd level commoner, or a 4th level wizard/2nd level Coral Islander.  XP gained normally for the class and other triggers, similar to alignment XP and end of session XP, for the background XP.<br /><br />I put this here because this idea would make your background sort of like a compendium class.<br /><br />Am I making any sense here?

        <p>You are. I think it&#39;s a great idea, and a fun riff on the underlying idea of multi-classing - parallel rather than jumping back and forth. Definitely good to think about.</p>

        <p>Yeah, I really love that idea too, though I&#39;ve never played in a game with them.  I think Heritage Moves are really cool.  But, unless I&#39;m mistaken, this is something pretty different, though it could be applied to Heritage Moves, too.  <br /><br />Unless there is already something like this I don&#39;t know about yet with Heritage Moves!  In that case, double awesome!</p>

        <p>&quot;When you create a new adventurer, decide on your species, <b>ethnicity, and cultural heritage</b> (...).&quot;<br /><br />Heritage moves are about cultural background of characters, is really easy to ignore the species part and focus on the etnical and cultural part and make it a move about what the character learn in his/her homeland. ^^<br /><br /><br />But your idea about get one move about background every level is also cool!</p>

        <p>Is there a list or compilation of Heritage Moves somewhere?</p>

        <p>I kind of really like the idea of having seperate xp-moves for different classes/backgrounds.</p>
