I&#39;ve been thinking how to do duels without it &#39;just&#39; being H&amp;S and defy danger.  These would be for formal gauntlet thrown down, seconds in attendance type affairs.  The basic jist is you roll and add your level and take away points depending on how much additional damage you are trying to do (or using tags / causing debility).  The base damage is the normal for your class then you can add more on top  (mages and clerics can choose their damaging spell of choice and then add extra)<br /><br />Duelling<br />Roll + level<br />10+ inflict effect without taking effect<br />7-9  Inflict and receive full damage OR <br />Inflict half damage &amp; either Debility / Tag and receive full damage<br />OR Inflict &amp; receive 1/2 damage<br />6-<br />Take full damage inflict half<br />Take half damage and Tag / Debility inlfict half damage <br />Take tag and debility inflict half damage<br />take half damage<br /><br />Damage base + free<br />D6            -1<br />B(2D6)    -2<br />D8            -3<br />B(2D8)    -4<br />D10         -5<br />B(2D10)  -6<br />D12          -7<br />B(2D12)  -8<br />Debility   -3 per<br />Apply tag to strike -4 per

        <p>How about a custom move for the pc? Something like:<br /><br />When you exchange thrusts in a duel, roll +wis (maybe cha?). On a 10+, choose 3. ON a 7-9, choose 1. On a 6-, well, look to the GM with a pitiful expression.<br /><br />-- You advance your position, deal damage or debility to your opponent.<br />-- You avoid the damage of your opponent.<br />-- You prove the dishonor of your opponent.<br />-- You do not show dishonor.</p>

        <p>I&#39;m trying to recreate the feel of Lo5R duelling where you increase the risk of missing vs increased damage.  This would be awesome for a &#39;gentlemans club&#39; or honour duelling though</p>
