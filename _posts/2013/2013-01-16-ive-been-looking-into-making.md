I&#39;ve been looking into making new monsters – adventure conversion tends to do this – and have traditionally thought that each monster should have three moves (its what Dungeon World typically has, so why not take advice from the master).<br /><br />However, there exists a tension as I work to explain the Ichtha-Gogs, an interpretation of Kuo-Toans, and their important racial &quot;moves&quot;. In the case of Ichtha-Gogs, they are all extremely slippery…to the point of being able to slip out of most any bindings.<br /><br />Does it make sense to do this via a Special Quality or a Custom Move?<br /><br />The tension becomes in limiting the number of moves to 3 (I suppose I could go up to 4).<br /><br />Also, in the case of Ichtha-Gogs, the &quot;slip any bind&quot; is a weaksauce move, but in thinking about True Ghouls and their ability to spawn new True Ghouls, I have to wonder if that should be a Special Quality.<br /><br />Thoughts?

        <p>It should definitely be a special quality. It can also be a move.<br /><br />The thing about special qualities is they express the fiction directly. If you put something as a move it&#39;s something the monster can do, in the right conditions. A special quality is more of an always-on thing.<br /><br />Basically, you want the GM to have as good a chance of getting the fact they&#39;re slippery into his head as possible.</p>

        <p>As I was writing the post, it became clear that Extremely Slipper was a special quality. But I needed confirmation/affirmation.</p>

        <p>The quality is totally &quot;Extremely Slippery&quot; and the move is an expression of that &quot;Squirm away from danger&quot; or something.</p>

        <p>So you would recommend both a quality and an associated move?</p>

        <p>Depends on how much you want to focus on their slipperiness.  I&#39;d say quality for sure, and if that&#39;s not QUITE enough, then add a move.<br /><br />Think about the differentiation between &quot;is&quot; and &quot;does&quot; too.<br /><br />I am a nerd, I do advertising.  I&#39;m not an advertiser who does nerdy stuff.  ;-)</p>

        <p>Yeah, you&#39;ll see that some monsters have a move that reflects a special quality. That&#39;s deliberate, and usually for monsters that are really about that thing. </p>

        <p>Mhmm, or monsters that use that particular thing in a weird or unique way.</p>
