I&#39;d like to run a one-shot of DW with my friends, but since we will play just one time I was looking for some advice when you play a one-shot.<br /><br />It&#39;s also our first time playing Dw (with some of them I use/used to play Aw).<br /><br />What kind of prep do I have to set?<br />Do I have to prepare fronts in advance? <br />Maybe an adventure fronts?<br /><br />

        <p>Compelling situation + thematically related details + print out playbooks/move sheets = good to go. <br /><br />Situation should be immediate; not &quot;orcs are invading your homeland, what are you going to do about it?&quot; but &quot;from your hiding place you can see the masked cult leader raising the sacrificial dagger over her, what do you do right now?&quot;. Loaded questions are a good way of introducing facts you&#39;ve prepared for but letting the players flesh out details, for example &quot;what gave away the fact that Lord Topriff was the cult&#39;s leader?&quot; Having a couple thematically related details ready will be handy - if you know there will be a count and a cult then you can make up a cultist monster, a count&#39;s signet ring, list a couple likely locations like the count&#39;s chambers or the disguised cult house, and maybe some likely names to pull from in play. You&#39;re not planning a plot, just brainstorming some setting elements that you might use.  I&#39;d just roll with the moves the payers initiate during the first season - fronts are really for expanding on things the players have already engaged in.</p>

        <p>I&#39;d also start in media res. &quot;As you stumble from the ogre&#39;s barely-parried blow, you are suddenly struck by how you were convinced that this dungeon held riches beyond your wildest dreams. How did that happen, again?&quot;</p>
