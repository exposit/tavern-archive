As a GM with a cleric in the party is your first front always that character&#39;s god?

        <p>I usually prefer to explore that character&#39;s religious organization.</p>

        <p>4 sessions in with a paladin and a cleric (with bonds to each other about religious differences) and we only now are starting to explore the religious organization let alone an actual front.</p>

        <p>Yeah, gods are boring compared to the writhing sea of humanity that clusters around them with their selfish and misguidedly selfless desires.</p>

        <p>I usually tend to go straight for an opposing deity. I agree that the humans caught up in it are far more interesting, but left to my own devices I tend to go pretty high-concept, big-idea. So twilight of the gods, rival gods, etc.</p>

        <p>I&#39;ve got a paladin and a cleric of the same god, pursuing dark secrets, and lawful, but kind of clearly lawful evil.</p>

        <p>It&#39;s also worthwhile to think about religion in a more interesting way than D&amp;D traditionally does. D&amp;D gods often act like the ones in the original Clash of the Titans; they&#39;re a weird idealized British-storybook version of the Roman or Norse gods. They have fixed domains, they have specific groups of worshippers that apparently worship a single god (which isn&#39;t really how those religions work, right? unless you&#39;re in a crazy cult), they are constantly plotting against each other, etc. But religion in the real world doesn&#39;t really work that way. I mean, ancient Roman and Norse religions didn&#39;t really work that way, much less religion in the rest of the world. The first thing I do when thinking about clerics is do a lot of wikipedia browsing on real religious groups throughout history and in different parts of the world and try to put the cleric in the middle of some of that &quot;bloody story meat,&quot; because imagination is a great tool, but often it&#39;s no match for how crazy life really is.</p>
