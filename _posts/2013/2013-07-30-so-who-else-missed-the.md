So who else missed the situational Armour rule? I just re-read the playing the game chapter for about the fourth time and noticed it tucked away in there. The one situational modifier in the game that has no situational modifiers : )<br /><br />PS its under the DAMAGE heading near the bottom of page 23.

        <p>Its in the Damage section  near the bottom of page 23 just after the list suggesting how much damage characters should take from various sources that are not monsters.:<br /><br />Temporary or circumstantial armor works the same way as armor that you wear: 1 armor for partial cover, 2 armor for major cover.</p>

        <p>Rules for how cover is handled aren&#39;t really situational bonuses. It&#39;s just how cover works. (i.e. If you have cover, it functions similar to how armor functions)  And if I recall correctly, it was mentioned in that other thread. A closer thing that DW has to situational bonuses is when a move grants someone +1 forward but only under certain situations. And those are all over the place.</p>

        <p>You aren&#39;t the only person to miss this. I was surprised to see it and pointed it out to my friday-night GM. ;)</p>
