I wrote up a Swashbuckler class some time ago, and maybe posted it to the forum, but I was re-reading it and I still really love this piece of equipment!<br /><br />(Not actually a magic item, but there&#39;s no general &quot;equipment&quot; section.)<br /><br />Bottle of cheap wine (+1-forward to parley when shared / +1-forward to hack and slash when downed quickly / 1-piercing, 3-uses, hand when empty / 2 weight)
