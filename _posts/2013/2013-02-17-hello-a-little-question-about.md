Hello,<br /><br />A little question about Multiclass Dabbler gaining level. A fighter casting wizard spells is considered a one lower level wizard for that. But is he also considered a Wizard when gaining levels ? I mean, does he gets new spells in his book as a Wizard do ? The example p31 is not very clear about that.<br /><br />I&#39;ve not tested it yet, but a fighter taking wizard spells as the first advanced move seems überpowered, maybe even more with cleric spells.<br />Those who have played it, what is your opinion ?

        <p>&quot;But is he also considered a Wizard when gaining levels ? I mean, does he gets new spells in his book as a Wizard do ?&quot;<br /><br />Yes, as gaining spells is part of one of the required Moves that grants spellcasting abilities (Spellbook).<br /><br />I wouldn&#39;t worry about it being overpowered, DW has a lot of wiggle-room in that department. Remember that any round spent casting a spell is a round spent <b>not being a Fighter</b>, which is what Fighters are best at. Also there&#39;s the player&#39;s own character concept to take into account. Our group&#39;s Paladin deliberately eschews the Divine Favor move that grants spellcasting powers of a Cleric because &quot;his&quot; Paladin is a virtuous knight and doesn&#39;t cast spells. If a player wants to create a spellcasting warrior-mage then multiclassing lets them do that, but it&#39;s really not overpowered, just flavourful. That&#39;s my two cents anyway, so far from what I&#39;ve seen spellcasting isn&#39;t the be-all and end-all that it is in D&amp;D, just a useful perk. I&#39;d argue that Ritual is far more potent an ability to nab for portraying a Fighter who dabbles in the occult.</p>

        <p>Yeah. If you&#39;ve got a fighter/wizard and a wizard, keep in mind the wizard will be at LEAST one &#39;spellcasting&#39; level higher, have Ritual, have a high int for wizardy lore-spouting, and have a pile more moves that boost spellcasting and such. It should be pretty obvious in play who is the dabbler in magic and who is the master.</p>
