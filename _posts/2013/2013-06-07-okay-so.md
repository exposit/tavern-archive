Okay so... &lt;deep breath&gt;<br /><br />my  <a rel="nofollow" class="ot-hashtag" href="https://plus.google.com/s/%23FighterWeek/posts">#FighterWeek</a>  contribution.<br /><br /><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WP2IgGl7f12etnEMA_XKE2KTE1-_wU_eCWnbTIIlFlM/edit" class="ot-anchor">https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WP2IgGl7f12etnEMA_XKE2KTE1-_wU_eCWnbTIIlFlM/edit</a><br /><br />I&#39;m putting it in the Compendium Classes section because, well, it has compendium classes in it. It is, however, a campaign supplement with more than just CCs.<br /><br />It&#39;s not complete, but I figured I might as well put up something to show and say I participated.<br /><br />There&#39;s a write-up of a main city and its steading tags (as best as I could grok the rules), and three of the six CCs I have ready to go. There will be a brief writeup for the town and keep that are mentioned with their steading tags, as well as (potentially) a new Agenda and Principles (which it was suggested I put in).<br /><br />Anyhow, here it goes.

        <p>Is it okay if I give you feedback tomorrow? Is it also okay if I steel 1-2 moves for my own fighting style idea?</p>

        <p>That&#39;s fine. I owe you feedback on your Empathic Hero. You may steal as long as you attribute and share alike, as per the CC :)</p>

        <p>Okay let&#39;S go. I will go move by move okay? <br /><br />IMPOSING STATURE<br />When you parley with a display of might you use STR instead of CHA.<br /> <br />i would change this to +1 forward when you do it since htere is allready a fightermove like that. <br /><br />BLARING TRUMPET<br />When you parley with an enemy after striking it so impressively that they are unable to respond, you need offer no promise; the superiority of your well-executed maneuver is sufficiently compelling.<br /><br />Does this turn a 7-9 into a 10+ basically? <br /><br />HEADSTRONG WALLOP<br />When you strike an enemy with the flat of your blade instead of the edge, your strike gains the forceful tag. A strike delivered in this fashion will definitely knock them off their feet.<br /><br />You can ditch the last sentece, that is basicaly included in the tag. <br /><br />It feels strange to me that half of the fighting style is social stuff and not fighty stuff... </p>

        <p>PAY NO ATTENTION<br />When you hold a GM Character’s attention with exuberant hand gestures, roll+DEX. On a 10+, you’ve got them completely enthralled. On a 7-9, you’ve got their attention, but you need to work at it, opening yourself up to danger.<br /><br />does basically work i think. Maybe it needs to be a bit clearer what is actually happening. <br /><br />FLEETING STAB<br />When you strike an enemy who is unaware of your presence, roll+DEX. On a 10+, deal damage to the enemy and your presence continues to go unnoticed; on a 7-9, you may either deal no damage and remain unnoticed, or deal -1d4 damage and draw the enemy’s attention.<br /><br />The first 7-9 result seems like there is actually nothing happening. When you have poison on your blade maybe there is something happening but... <br />How about damage and noticed or damage-1d4 and unnotived? This might still be to good...<br /><br />BARRAGE OF STABS<br />When you unleash a flurry of small, quick cuts upon your enemy, roll+DEX. On a 10+, you paralyze the enemy, making them helpless, unable to respond to attack. On a 7-9, the enemy suffers the Shaky debility.<br /><br />Can monsters suffer debilities? I also don&#39;t really see how making them bleed of thousand cuts paralyses them. <br /><br />SLICED TO RIBBONS<br />When you successfully execute Barrage of Stabs, on a 12+ you cut your enemy into pieces, killing it instantly.<br /><br />I would vote this as a big nono. Instantkill isn&#39;t fun. </p>

        <p>THE CENTER ALWAYS HOLDS<br />When you crouch down low and take the brunt of a forceful attack, shield first, nothing can deny you sure footing (cause you to lose your balance, for example, or fall prone).<br /><br />this one is really cool, i like it a lot. <br /><br />WATER OFF A TURTLE’S SHELL<br />When you carry a shield in each hand, trading off between delivering blows and protecting yourself from them, you can either benefit from +2 Armor, or +1 Armor and treat the other shield as a weapon, dealing your class damage with it as if it were any other without penalty. You must decide this each time you make or respond to a move that involves suffering and/or dealing damage.<br /><br />you maybe need to clean this up a bit more? Maybe simply beeing able to treat a shield as a weapon with so and so keywords? +1 armor -1 damage, close ? <br /><br />GRAZING CUT<br />When you lean your body in time that of your enemy’s strike in order to lesson the degree of injury inflicted, roll+CON. On a 10+, choose 2; on a 7-9, choose 1:<br />the enemy only deals damage equal to the base damage die roll result<br />you suffer only half the damage dealt by the enemy (rounded up)<br />the enemy cannot benefit from superior combat capabilities (rolls only one damage die)<br />the enemy cannot inflict a debility upon you<br /><br />this feels a bit to much like a mix between Defy Danger and Defend. <br />I would maybe change this to something like <br /><br />When you defy the danger of your opponents attack by enduring under your shields, take+1 additional armor on a 7-9. Or something like that. <br /><br />AN INCH FROM THE GATE<br />When you huddle behind both your shields and are reduced to 1 HP, you may defy danger +CON if you maintain this stance and perform no other action; as long as you hit, you cannot be reduced below 1 HP.<br /><br />You can already do that, the thing about not beeing able to die is cool though. Maybe combine the two moves? <br /><br />IN HARM’S WAY<br />When you harry an enemy by forcing yourself, shield first, inside the space it needs to fight effectively, you may elect to forego the +1 Armor granted by one or both of your shields and take instead a +1 ongoing to defy danger +CON.<br /><br />This move seems to mechanical to me and hasn&#39;t enough hooks in the fiction... <br /><br />BLUNT THE BLOW<br />When you successfully execute Grazing Cut, on a 12+ choose 3 instead of 2.<br /><br /><br />See above</p>
