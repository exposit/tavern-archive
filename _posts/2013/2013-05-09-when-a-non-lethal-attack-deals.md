When a non-lethal attack deals stun damage, do you say &quot;you take X stun damage&quot; and mark it separately from normal damage, or do you say &quot;you suffered a non-lethal attack, you&#39;re stunned&quot;...or something else entirely?

        <p>I just narrate. Stun mechanics are too cumbersome.</p>

        <p>I&#39;m trying to write a move, so I&#39;m interested to know how people use stun as described on p 24 of the DW book.</p>

        <p>&quot;The pugilist clocks you in the jaw, you reel back stunned for a moment. He&#39;s winding up for the knockout, what do you do?&quot;<br /><br />If the character does anything, they need to defy danger.<br /><br />As written a PC doesn&#39;t take physical damage, and until it makes narrative sense (i.e. a minute or so has passed, someone throws cold water on you, you get some smelling salts, etc.) the PC is stunned and must defy danger to act.</p>

        <p>Okay, so it&#39;s nothing like &quot;the pugilist deals X stun/non-lethal/whatever damage&quot;, it&#39;s simply &quot;you&#39;re stunned&quot;...?</p>

        <p>That is my reading of p24.</p>

        <p>It was my reading as well, but upon going back it seemed to be kind of contradictory. Glad to see that someone sees it the same way I did before I second-guessed myself :P</p>

        <p>As a GM, you can just state it. Instead of saying &quot;Roll Last Breath&quot; You just say &quot;You&#39;re unconscious&quot; or &quot;Take the Stunned debility&quot;<br /><br /><br /><b>K.O.</b><br />When you <b>Attempt to knock someone out</b> roll +Str. *On a 10+, they&#39;re out cold. *On a 7-9, Choose 1. *On a miss, the GM chooses 1:<br /><br />-You did more harm than you intended<br />-You drew unwanted attention<br />-They&#39;re only dazed...</p>
