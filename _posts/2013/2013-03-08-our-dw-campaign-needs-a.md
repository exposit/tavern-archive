Our DW campaign needs a wiki!  There are a million options, which one should I pick?  Here&#39;s what&#39;s important to me:<br /><br />* wiki functionality, easy cross-linking &amp; new doc generation. I believe this rules out Google Docs.<br />* not a jail; documents should be easy to export from it<br />* solid.  Not buggy.  My last campaign wiki was on pbworks and the rich editor was a buggy nightmare.<br />* (edit) free is very nice.<br />* (edit) all participants need to be able to edit it.

        <p>I&#39;ve never actually used it, but is Obsidian Portal any good?</p>

        <p>I have heard from others in the past that <a href="http://tiddlywiki.com/" class="ot-anchor">http://tiddlywiki.com/</a> is a great little tool to use and I have seen people simply put it up on their sites.</p>

        <p>I have scratched the surface of Obsidian Portal and liked it a lot. I don&#39;t remember export functionality, but it was solid and easy to use. You can have 2 campaigns for free, but you can&#39;t share editing rights as I recall ($=more campaigns, players can edit campaign entries).</p>

        <p>I watched some of their videos and it does look easy and cool.  Is it cool enough to warrant paying for it?  The free version won&#39;t cut it, we all have to be able to edit it.</p>

        <p>Thanks, I didn&#39;t know about google sites.  And they have some premade rpg templates...</p>

        <p>Yeah I have used them several times to write up rpg stuff and have given people permissions to add pages and such.  It works in a pinch :).</p>

        <p>From the Obsidian Portal wiki tips:<br /><br /><i>Don&#39;t be afraid to use the wiki for metagame information. It&#39;s a great place to store information like who owes money for pizza.</i><br /><br />I remember once I played with this dude who metagamed his pizza.  He was awesome, he could get like fifty toppings for ten bucks.</p>

        <p>I only storygame my pizzas.  I want to know WHY the pepperoni feels the need to taste the way it does.</p>

        <p>I use Obsidian Portal, and find it well worth paying for.  I don&#39;t know about exports, but it&#39;s all just markdown.  I&#39;ve also used EpicWords, but I like Obsidian Portal better.  Self-hosted, my default is pmwiki; I can recommend that if you want to go that route, but Obsidian Portal just made things so much easier.</p>
