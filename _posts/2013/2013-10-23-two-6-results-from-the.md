Two 6- results from the session yesterday I really liked:<br /><br />1. The ranger trying to climb up the robe really fast so she can her her comrades who are attacked by 4 guards. She rolls a 5 and I tell her, just as she is really close to the top of the castle wall, one of the guards sees her and the robe and cuts it down with his sword. &quot;And suddenly you feel gravity pulling on you, really hard&quot; <br />(She is a dexterous elf and was able to grab on to something during the fall) <br /><br />2. Unrelated to the move in question suddenly there is rumbling and energy coming from underground. Unknown to the party the ritual downstairs has gotten horribly wrong. Instead of turning the dark cultist noble immortal in enchanted the whole castle, turning everyone that died there into a zombie. The effect is still on. And zombies only die to head wounds. <br />That will be fun.
