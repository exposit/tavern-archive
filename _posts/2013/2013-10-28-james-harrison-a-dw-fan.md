James Harrison, a DW fan, recently shared this amusingly formatted email with me about his trials and victories playing Dungeon World for the first time with some folks in Uganda!  I thought the Tavernites would appreciate it.<br /><br />Campaign Front: Dungeon world Uganda<br /><br />Cast<br />James Harrison (English volunteer &amp; lone geek. Impulse: GM an awesome game. Knack: D.W. PDF) &amp; 5 First time Role-players working for an NGO… oh yes… name everyone;<br /><br />Hannah Harrison (E. volunteer. I: Change into animals K: Smoke pipeleaf)<br /><br />Tom (Ugandan social worker. I: Steal everything not nailed down. K:<br />ignore everything &amp; go steal)<br /><br />David (U. Children’s co-ordinate. I: Defend the weak with his<br />ancestral blade K: Rolling 6-)<br /><br />Michael (U. Welfare &amp; Estate Manager. I: Call down the power of god K: Rolling 10+)<br /><br />Fred (U. Accountant. I: Be well liked, traveled &amp; versed in lore K: Wings!)<br /><br />Stakes<br />Will people enjoy themselves?<br />Will people understand the rules?<br />Will people want to play again?<br /><br />Danger: 	Ugandan Electricity Company<br />Type: 			Thieves guild		(I: to be paid, without providing electricity)<br />Impending Doom:	Impoverishment of eyesight &amp; spirit<br />Grim Portents:<br />The power goes off<br />The room slowly darkens<br />Character creation occurs by lantern light<br /><br />Danger: 	First time Role-players<br />Type: 			Wandering Barbarians* 	(I: to make characters &amp; play the<br />muzungu’s game)<br />Impending Doom:	Rampant Chaos<br />Grim Portents:<br />	Manic chuckling at looks and bonds<br />A player decides to wield a Bible<br />A players opening move is to spread their wings and fly<br />A serious discussion occurs as to which Ugandan forest contains dwarves<br /><br />Danger: 	Darkness &amp; Storm<br />Type:			 Elemental Vortex 	(I: to reduce roads to rivers of mud &amp;<br />curtail travel)<br />Impending Doom:	 Usurping the RPG<br />Grim Portents:<br />	Region wide power cut promises dangerous trip home<br />	Rumbling thunder heard<br />Distant Lightning seen<br />Promise of storm brings First session come to an abrupt close.<br /><br />(*Actually they are sitting… but they don’t speak any Latin. Muzungu = white man. Oh, just thinking of the dwarf conversation brings tears of laughter to my eyes)<br /><br />Stake resolutions:<br />	People really enjoyed themselves! We had a blast and our evening was filled with lots of laughter, fun, never-before-tasted Pringles &amp;<br />squinting at small text in poor light. Everyone simply accepted the<br />game as a fun evening to be had. I’ve been really stoked (&amp; surprised) by just how much fun everyone had.<br />	<br />The darkness made it difficult to read, so after character creation I<br />skipped going over the moves and jumped straight into the action. The conversation basis of the game is beautiful and flowed nicely. Dice rolls are straightforward and everyone got them. I think after we have looked over the basic moves the trigger system will help player’s descriptions improve. I was taken aback when the Bard suddenly had wings; but it’s frankly too awesome not to have not - I think the pitch (starting on a flying island) signposted more than I intended.<br />	<br />We only had about 35 minutes of play time and ended the session in<br />the opening moments of the first fight – a cliff-hanger ending, and a<br />tense intro to more of the game basics next time. The session ended<br />with a player statement of “so we’ll play again tomorrow.” No higher<br />praise for a game eh? However, not everyone was free so Front: “The<br />1st real adventure: Complete with moves!”  will be hitting an screen<br />near you NGO quite-a-long-way-away-from you soon!<br /><br />I’ve had fun writing this font, feel free to share it wherever &amp; with<br />whomever you want. I hope it might inspire some people to do likewise: Take a risk and start a game with people you’d assume wouldn’t be interested. Roleplaying is fun and people enjoy it world over!

        <p>We played again this Friday - just a short session having a fight with a crystal golem - but they all got a better grip of the moves and really enjoyed themselves - and love how DW ties in everything keeping things always moving forward!<br />Awesome stuff :)</p>
