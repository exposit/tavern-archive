Alpha of my first semi-complete Role for my Gothic Horror setting, The Scarred. Roles are like compendium classes you take at character creation to make the standard classes function appropriately for Horror. Looking for suggestions, revisions, and general feedback.<br /><br />Are there it too many moves?<br />Is it too complex to bolt onto existing classes?<br />Is it appropriate for the setting?<br />Suggestions for Races and Alignments.
