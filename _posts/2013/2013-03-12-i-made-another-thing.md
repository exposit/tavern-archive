I made another thing. This time it&#39;s a blank monster card with tabs.<br /><br />There are some instructions with this one. It&#39;s designed for a 5 x 8 index card. Cut on the thin rectangle and either fold or cut on the dotted line. You can glue the whole shebang to an index card or just glue/staple/tape the two sides together.<br /><br />The tabs are for the monster type. Cut out the tabs that don&#39;t apply to the monster in question. The Custom tab is for anything you want, like favorite or featured monsters.<br /><br />You can now pull out all of the cards of a certain category, no matter where they are in your monster stack. If you keep your monsters in an index box, you can pull a monster at random if you need one in a hurry by taking the first card that has the tab you want.<br /><br /><a href="http://pavao.org/dungeonworld/MonsterCards.pdf" class="ot-anchor">http://pavao.org/dungeonworld/MonsterCards.pdf</a>
