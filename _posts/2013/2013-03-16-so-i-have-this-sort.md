So I have this sort of nebulous idea and thought you all might help me flesh it out - a monster that is invisible, but can only be seen in reflection. Mirror, polished shield or weapon, etc. Maybe put a broken mirror in the room so the PCs can catch a glimpse of the creature (and to help them figure out what is attacking them). What would you add to this?

        <p>If they have a reflective surface on a shield or something that is a cool thing to use. </p>

I was thinking it would always be invisible, whether attacking or not. The PCs would have to figure out that they can only see it in reflection to be able to attack it.</p>

        <p>this can turn ugly really really fast, just as a heads up. Something with dangerous natural weapons and natural invisiblity will f you up pretty pretty fast. <br /><br />You could have one PC down before the others know what is happening. How &quot;regulary&quot; will you apply damage?<br />If it just takes bite after bite after bite out of a PC...<br /><br />Idea against that: The bite of the monster transfers a poison. It just goes arround, biting everyone until they are poisioned all and then just waits - not attacking really until provoked.</p>

        <p>Hi, I&#39;m here to criticize without knowing you or your group!<br /><br />That said: making an obstacle and deciding the solution it&#39;s not good form. You say a monster is invisible, well that&#39;s good, but it&#39;s up to the players to figure out how to overcome it. Maybe the paladin has &quot;An unwavering sense of direction to&quot; it, or the wizard can put on a ritual that reveals it, or the cleric can detect it thanks to a divine boon,  or the thief has a sack of dust to throw at it, or the ranger&#39;s companion can smell it, or someone else spouts lore about it and learn that they can spot it on reflective surfaces even before the fight starts...<br /><br /><br />All of this bearing in mind that challenging the players&#39; wits is totally NOT one of your goals in DW.</p>

I guess it&#39;s up to them to decide if the creature can be seen in reflection. To your point about challenging the players&#39; wits - do you never have puzzles or other challenges in your adventures?</p>

        <p>wait! It&#39;s not up to the players decide what a monster&#39;s abilities are, it&#39;s just up to them how to overcome a monster! Maybe they will never know about its flaw, but they will certainly find a way to defeat it.<br /><br />and, puzzles, it depends. If they are in line with the principles, the agenda, my tastes, and they&#39;re part of a move that follows from the fiction, all the way (I&#39;m a fan of puzzles and riddles!). It&#39;s just that they are not the focus of the game. What I meant was to reference to the gm&#39;s agenda on page 161:<br />&quot;You’re not trying to beat the players or test their ability to solve complex traps.&quot;</p>

        <p>To avoid it becoming messy fast, have npcs with them or even a town /city village be plagued by it, the creature could have a higher purpose too.<br /><br />The creature then starts targeting npcs to give them a heads up as signs of an approaching doom.</p>

        <p>Or a lone survivor of the previous party of adventurers to go through that area can tell your players a story of the invisible terror, give them a chance to prepare.  </p>

        <p>Or give it a main attack that is scary, but not immediately damaging. Like maybe it drags the players off into separate rooms, one by one, leaving them to wonder what is going to happen to them (also giving them a chance to escape).</p>
