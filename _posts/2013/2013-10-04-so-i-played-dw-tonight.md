So, I played DW tonight with my gf. That is, Larethe, a lonely elven ranger, her only friend her huge white wolf, Raaka (she discovered princess mononoke not so long ago and it was love at first sight). She protects the black forest from necromancers, which corrupt creatures and trees, and from her own elven kingdom, where the mad elven king stole necromantic secrets to increase his power. I suggested her to start with a fellow npc, and she created the weak and coward Sir Alister, son of Lord Piotr, ruler of Tanner&#39;s Ford, a coastal city where all the worst representatives of the four races gathered together. He fell in one of her traps and she tried to get him into the safety of his castle, while fighting various giant necro-monsters (she ended at 3 hp, weakened and with a broken arm), and meeting with the Hermit of the Forest, so old he forgot his name and his race. This was all created by her during the usual Q&amp;A. We had a great time together, like a romantic evening with dice.<br /><br />Guys, take your gf and play this game with her. You won&#39;t regret it. Especially the aftermath.

        <p>I think she joined the dw-addicted community. She actually wants to play one on one every friday night from now on. That&#39;s like what, a total win?</p>
