We&#39;ve just had our first AP session. Did most of character creation midweek, and today was introductions and bondwriting.<br />Im not sure if this is what they meant but I had the first two characters, <span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink" href="https://plus.google.com/100157839196450550615" oid="100157839196450550615">Charli Kingston</a></span> &#39;s elven ranger and <span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink" href="https://plus.google.com/110195409767717201591" oid="110195409767717201591">Darren Turner</a></span> &#39;s human barbarian, simply fill in the suggested bonds on their sheets, one for each of the other characters. Then when my lad tomas, playing an elven wizard, came to write his bonds there was already a framework of sorts there.<br /><br />In line with the book I started off dropping the players into the thick of things, literally.<br />I wrote notes as I went along and part way through realised I have an audio recorder which I kicked in. I reckon I&#39;ll scan the notes and upload the sounds soon. I presume it&#39;s cool to share them here?<br /><br />TL;DR - we played. We liked.

        <p>I&#39;ve seen this acronym (AP) around. What does it mean?</p>

        <p>Actual Play around here.  Associated Press in other contexts.  Advanced Placement if you&#39;re around high schools.  Alternate Plane if you&#39;re at a carriage stop in the city of Dis and want to know if that route will take you off-plane.  </p>

        <p>So what would <i>not</i> actual play be?</p>

        <p>Discussion about the game, rules clarifications, fan-created monsters/classes/adventures, etc.  Also, when one sits around and daydreams about playing a game (which I do way too much) that is not <i>actual</i> play.</p>
