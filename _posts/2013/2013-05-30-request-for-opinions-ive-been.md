Request for opinions<br /><br />I&#39;ve been playing with the basic idea that a 7-9 lets me do a soft move against the player, and a 6- lets me do a hard move. Most of the moves have their own description of what happens; but how fudge-able is that? If someone botches a Hack &amp; Slash, am I in the clear for playing something other than Deal Damage? I don&#39;t want to give the impression that there are no rules at all and I&#39;m just making up everything as I go, but one of the things I love about this game is the narrative options on failure (if I&#39;m doing it right, that is).

        <p>6- is GM makes a move.  Doesn&#39;t have to be Deal Damage, even from a failed Hack &amp; Slash.  Knock away their weapon, break their shield, or have them thrown to the ground.<br /><br />Usually for a fail on a H&amp;S, there&#39;s already been a soft move that the player responded to with H&amp;S, so go as hard as you want.  :)</p>

        <p>For instance, I had a paladin who got in the final hit on an earth elemental. He was down to a couple hit points, and he rolled a 7-9. He dealt damage to the monster and killed it. If the elemental dealt damage in return, the paladin would have died, which is no fun. So instead, I did Use Up a Resource by having his weapon break from the mighty swing. Correct call? <br /><br />The players all liked it, and it <i>felt</i> right at the time, so ultimately I think it was ok, but is that the way the rules are intended?</p>

        <p>That is <i>exactly</i> Rules As Written.  :)<br /><br />But what&#39;s this about not killing PCs?  Then you don&#39;t get to use one of my favorite mechanics from the game, the <b>Last Breath</b>!  &gt;:)</p>

        <p>Oh, I&#39;m all for killing characters, but this didn&#39;t feel like the right time to do it. I was working really hard to make the encounter not play like some <i>other</i> games, where combatants just stand toe to toe and beat on each other until someone drops.<br /><br />But Last Breath is definitely one I need get into play.  :)</p>

        <p>Last Breath only indicates death on a 6-, about 42% of the time.  Even then, if you look at the wording of it, the fail condition doesn&#39;t indicate that the player dies <i>at that instant.</i>  On average, I&#39;ll have a player use a Last Breath every 2 or 3 sessions.</p>

        <p>Just in case it isn&#39;t clear, I think Joel is pointing out that non-damage causing attacks are allowed on 7-9 Hack &amp; Slash roll.  From the Dungeon World Guide (which is awesome):<br /><br />Do More Than Deal Damage<br /><br />Obviously, you get to deal damage when the player misses on a Hack &amp; Slash. But that&#39;s not all you get to do: the rules say &quot;the monster makes an attack,&quot; not &quot;the monster deals damage.&quot; Deal Damage is just one of many options, look at the GM Moves and pick one. Knock them over, grab their weapon, threaten an ally, put them in a spot, damage their armor, grapple them, surround them. Dungeon World is awesome because cinematic fights thrive under these rules, so go crazy.</p>

        <p>Most of the time I feel like I&#39;m making it all up as I go along. In retrospect I have a hard time identifying anything I&#39;ve done as being outside the rules as written.</p>

        <p>I certainly have the same feeling, Chris. I am trying to play intentionally to the RAW, as I find it&#39;s helping me break out of ruts.</p>

        <p>How about looking from a slightly different angle. On 7-9, Volley hits, but then the player chooses from the list of consequences. Sort of a static Tell Them The Requirements Or Consequences And Ask. Is it ever appropriate to do a different soft move? I&#39;m thinking of a situation like an archer hits a goblin on a 7-9, and the goblin is killed, but as it falls over, it alerts the other goblins that something is going on and riles up the whole tribe (Reveal An Unwelcome Truth). I don&#39;t want a player to say &quot;Hey, that&#39;s no fair, I just wanted to mark off a resource&quot;.</p>

        <p>Ok, so based on all the comments and rereading through the moves chapter, it looks like 7-9 should be as written in the move, and 6- is a GM move. Whether it&#39;s a hard or soft move depends on context, not on how the player rolled.<br /><br />The only real &quot;exception&quot; is Hack &amp; Slash, where it specifically says that a 7-9 can be any GM move, as long as it is made directly with that creature. That can be a creature move or a custom move specific to that creature. <br /><br />Does that sound about right? <br /><br />I should point out that we&#39;re all loving this game, and haven&#39;t had any problems. I&#39;m mostly trying to head off any possible future problems.</p>
