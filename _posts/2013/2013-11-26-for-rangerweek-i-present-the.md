For  <a rel="nofollow" class="ot-hashtag" href="https://plus.google.com/s/%23rangerweek/posts">#rangerweek</a>  I present the Bow Adept, a brief little compendium class which should probably not be taken seriously unless you really really want to.<br /><br />When you <b>realize there is no spoon,</b> you may take the following move the next time you level up:<br /><br />Arrow Time<br />You can <i>always</i> attempt to dodge physical sources of harm with a Defy Danger (+DEX) roll, regardless of the specifics of the danger or your level of awareness. If you choose to use Arrow Time, your dodging does not result in a change of position.<br /><br />Once you have taken Arrow Time, the following moves are added to your list of possible advances:<br /><br />Dodge This<br />You may Volley at Hand range, regardless of your weapon&#39;s range tags. If you do, take +1 to both the volley and damage rolls.<br /><br />Bow Kata<br /><i>Requires: Blot Out the Sun</i><br />When you use Blot Out the Sun, treat a cluster of nameless enemies as a single target. You must still expend one ammo before rolling if you wish to attack the entire group.<br /><br />We&#39;re Going to Need Arrows. Lots of Arrows.<br />Whenever you have a few minutes of safety to reorganize your gear, you may set the ammo for any ranged weapon you possess to three.<br /><br />This is My Boomstick<br />Whenever you display your prowess at archery as Leverage, you may Parley using +DEX rather than +CHA.

        <p>Bow Kata kind of clashes with <br />Give every monster life</p>
