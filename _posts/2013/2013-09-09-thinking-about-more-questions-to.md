Thinking about more questions to ask my players tonight, because I don&#39;t think enough have been asked to link them to the world yet.<br /><br />Am I crossing a line if I ask the human druid &quot;What happened back home when you failed to control your powers?&quot; (My concern being, I&#39;m explicitly stating he lost control of his powers one time.) Am I worried about nothing - or any suggestions on rewording or asking different questions?

        <p>[edit] I just saw the &quot;Read More&quot;, hah! I don&#39;t think that idea crosses a line at all. I think there are suggestions that recommend such questions (I mention some &quot;leading&quot; questions below as well) [/edit]<br /><br />Are you looking for some suggestions? You might start with their classes, and think about how (typically) their roles are tied to a world.<br /><br />Some quick examples...<br /><br />Fighters are sometimes former soldiers.<br />@Fighter-&quot;Have you served in the military before? Why/Why Not?&quot;<br /><br />Wizards have various ways they could have come to know magic.<br />@Wizard-&quot;When did you know magic would be something you would wield? What were the circumstances of you learning it?&quot;<br /><br />Again, these are two generic (and quickly drummed up) examples.<br /><br />Additionally, your questions could be more leading if you want to focus on knowing something more specific about your world by drawing details out of your players...<br /><br />@Cleric-&quot;The god you worship has been in decline over the years. What have you promised to do in order to help reverse this trend?&quot;<br /><br />@Thief-&quot;The King&#39;s Palace is the resting place for 3 items of power, one of which was stolen recently. Who have you heard could be involved and what is your relation to them?&quot;<br /><br />Anyway, just some quick suggestions, in case you were looking for some!</p>

        <p>No. That is totally fine. Especially in the beginning you have a lot of control over the characters. You SHOULD be asking leading questions like this. <br />The players can do whatever they want with this but that is especially your work. What you bring into the first session. <br /><br />In a way it is a really lazy job for the GM because they just have to ask questions and let the players do all the work.<br /><br />WRONG! <br /><br />Asking the right questions, questions that can be used to create something and add richness and diversity to the game are work. <br /><br />Through the way you phrase your question you are creating stuff about the world too, the players do just fill it out. <br /><br />Things like<br />&quot;So who did train you&quot; are not as good as &quot;So who was the master you had the big falling out with and why was it?&quot; (not the best example)<br /><br />But every question should bring something into the game in itself and then get added on by the players. <br /><br />Through the kinds of questions you ask you are also setting a lot of the tone of the game. So in your game primal magic is dangerous in a way and not something easily controlled. That is totally something you can do. <br />Just follow the principles, don&#39;t betray them. And when the players says something that totally kicks your game in a new direction? Run with it. Aks follow up questions.<br />We actually talked about this in <br /><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ1v_O-pbJY" class="ot-anchor">GM&#39;ing the World</a> <br /><br /><i>sorry, got a bit meandering in the end</i></p>

        <p>As <span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink" href="https://plus.google.com/110330901807759406775" oid="110330901807759406775">Tim Franzke</a></span> and <span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink" href="https://plus.google.com/106974596503338920008" oid="106974596503338920008">Mike Weem</a></span> have stated, you should be asking questions like this. You should be asking questions that have assumptions built into them, but also allow the players some creative control.<br /><br />The assumptions are what you want to establish and the answers are what the player wants to establish. You have a bit of additional control because you get to phrase the question. Here are some examples of the phrasing getting out of control in one direction or another.<br /><br />Too much GM control: &quot;When you were attacked, imprisoned, and sold into slavery, what color was the hair of your slave master?&quot;<br /><br />Too much player control: &quot;Who is the most powerful being on the planet and what is your relationship with them?&quot;<br /><br />As you can see, it&#39;s a sliding scale. It can go too far in one direction or another and I think balance is key. Something that the game Fiasco uses is like this: You can set the stage or determine the outcome, but not both.<br /><br />Your question about the druid determines the outcome but gives him the freedom to set the stage. <br /><br />In my mind, that makes it a &quot;fair&quot; question.</p>

        <p>Statement of fact about your character&#39;s history. Request for elaboration on one specific aspect of the same, in the form of an open-ended (non-yes/no) question? Why (as applicable)?</p>

        <p>To clarify my earlier post: I tend to ask general questions as they naturally occur to me... &quot;So, you say you are an apprentice to [name]? For how long now?&quot;. The answers can inspire more leading questions later (sometimes immediately, sometimes another session) which is good. I mention this because I feel like these kinds of (general) questions are okay and wouldn&#39;t want you to think your questions can ONLY be the well thought out, constructed questions.<br /><br />The more pointed/leading questions are the ones I actually think about in advance (while the players work up their characters and I know their classes, or between sessions or sometimes when they come to me immediately, etc).</p>

        <p>Thanks for the feedback guys, that&#39;s exactly what I was hoping for - glad I&#39;m on the right track. We&#39;ve had some questions come up naturally already (like how the Druid became a Druid, for example) but I really want to link the players into the world more (and set the tone of the game - thanks Tim!)</p>

        <p>If you want to do this without feeling like you&#39;re directing your players too much, you can let them know they&#39;re allowed to answer by negating your question.  <br /><br />So the answer to &quot;What happened back home when you failed to control your powers?&quot; could be &quot;I&#39;ve never lost control of my powers.&quot;  <br /><br />That might seem like a cop-out, but the GM can actually use that to raise more questions, like &quot;What allows you to maintain such complete control?&quot; <br /><br />Or you can use that answer to later on reveal that the tight lid the druid keeps on his power is actually creating a ticking time-bomb, showing itself as visions or nightmares.  </p>

        <p>I&#39;m going to disagree with <span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink" href="https://plus.google.com/102762255628835701562" oid="102762255628835701562">Dave Tarr</a></span>. &quot;Yes and...&quot; is a huge part of the mindset behind Dungeon World (I think). <br /><br />It&#39;s funny that I had to negate the idea of negating :)<br /><br />Negating things in the game creates dead ends. Dead ends are boring.<br /><br />But I do like the idea of follow up questions.</p>
