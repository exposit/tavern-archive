Played in my first session of Dungeon World today. I am playing Gorm the Gluttonous, warrior from the sandy South who woke up on a ship bound for the north thanks to a vengeful woman and a head-full of wine. Now he finds himself among strange barbarians and their mysterious, prophesied Mountain That Once Moved.<br /><br />(In truth, Gorm is a Barbarian, but I find it funny to play a Barbarian who thinks he&#39;s the only civilized person around. He has already introduced the party to coffee.)<br /><br />Gorm is fairly certain that the deepest dungeon beneath the Mountain where the party finds itself is actually the inside of an enormous sleeping dragon that has been trapped by the Mountain for 1000 years. And everyone says the Mountain is going to move again...
