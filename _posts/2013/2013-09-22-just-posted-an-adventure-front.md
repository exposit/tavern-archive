        <p>I feel as though you have more of the adventure in your head than you have written down. I&#39;m not sure how I&#39;d take your scenario to my players.<br /><br />&quot;You climb out of the ruins of the Inn to find a frightened mob of villagers. Three figures are standing on the lid of the village well loudly remonstrating with each other and the crowd. What do you do?&quot;</p>

        <p>Thanks Jeremy. I played through the scenario with my kids, and I think you are right. I put in many details, but left out flavor and description.</p>
