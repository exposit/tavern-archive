Still about Witcher moves, here&#39;s another starting one:<br /><br /><b>That Rumor is True</b><br /><br />You can parry crossbow bolts, arrows and such. This is just another way to <i>defy danger</i> - the move simply gives you the opportunity to make a cool description. You can roll wither Strength or Dexterity, as you prefer.
