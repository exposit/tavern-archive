Dragons have special quality elemental blood. What has this meant in your game? Looking for inspiration. Could see this meaning a lot of things in the fiction.

        <p>The first way I took it was to mean that part of their essence was the element, allowing them to breathe fire and whatnot. My next thought was that it was like the blood in Alien and it was literally elemental blood.</p>

        <p>Not familiar with alien, are you saying the blood burns when it spurts out?</p>

        <p>Yeah, in Alien, the blood is acid. So in Alien vs. Predator, the predators have a tightening net, but the alien gets out because the net breaks skin</p>
