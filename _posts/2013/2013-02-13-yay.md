Yay! My softcover arrived yesterday! Unfortunately, the tight-fitting bubble-envelope it came in was not kind to it at all.  :(  Front and back, the edges of the cover are all dinged up. On the front, the bottom right corner is dented enough that the first 20 pages or so are slightly dog-eared and on the back of the book, the top left corner looks like it got folded over at some point (there is a crease across the corner about one inch long), leaving some of the pages there dented as well. Overall, I am happy to finally have a physical copy to read, but I feel like I ended up with a used book from a second hand store. Is anyone else seeing any problems with the shape their softcover arrived in?

        <p>Looks like it seven-nined all the way through.</p>

        <p>It even rolled a 6- in the end, managing to get itself delivered to the wrong address (our postman is notorious for doing that).</p>

        <p>Mine was a little dinged up and bent, but not terrible. I suspect it would have weathered the journey better if there had been some kind of stiff cardboard backing or something involved in the packing instead of just a soft book inside a soft envelope.</p>

        <p>It does kind of explain why Chapters/Indigo uses huge cardboard mailers for their books here in Canada.  I&#39;ve received single Manga packed in boxes four times as big as the book itself!  The mailers end up bent and dented, but the books are always in perfect condition.  Can&#39;t imagine it&#39;s economical, though.</p>

And now I have visions of my postman making his rounds dressed in a dark, hooded cloak with a scythe slung over his shoulder . . . which would explain why the mail seems to normally show up over night . . . &quot;grim hand&quot; indeed.</p>

        <p>We here at Dungeon World Headquarters never allow the mail to get less than 7-9 on its Last Breath.</p>

        <p>Yep, same problem here. Shipping is an art, and tends to be overlooked in things Kickstarters,</p>
