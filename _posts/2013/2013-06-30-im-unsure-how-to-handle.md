I&#39;m unsure how to handle something mechanically, the PC&#39;s are in a dungeon and I want the goblins to harass them, but I can&#39;t see how to do this fairly in dungeon world. in other systems I would roll to hit a random pc but here I need to force a pc move to get a counter move. so how do you all handle things like this where monsters are taking the initiative?

        <p>&quot;the goblins taunt you and throw stones at you from unseen nooks. You feel a light tugging on your belt. Your coin purse has disappeared! What do you do?&quot; <br /><br />Any response is probably a Defy Danger. </p>

        <p>Does this seems a little awkwar when the pcs don&#39;t know there is a danger. alse feels a bit arbitrary on the 7-9 result. should this be a hit for the goblins and an oportunity to counter attack. or is dealling dhmage too hard a move?</p>

        <p>You set up a threat by broadcasting it. You can broadcast it discretely (&quot;you hear irregular shuffling noises in the darkness&quot;) or overtly (&quot;an arrow whizzes out of the darkness!&quot;) as appropriate to the already established fiction. You are allowed to set things up whenever you talk -- these are soft moves.<br /><br />If the characters do nothing about it (&quot;i ignore it and keep exploring,&quot; &quot;an arrow? whatever. i take it like a boss&quot;), follow through with a hard move (&quot;you stumble dumbly into an ambush,&quot; &quot;you take 8 damage and you fall to one knee when it takes out the other&quot;). This is a golden opportunity.<br /><br />If a character does something and fails (&quot;I search for danger <b>fails a roll</b> oh no,&quot; &quot;I deflect that arrow! <b>fails roll</b> oh noooo&quot;), then proceed with whatever hard move is appropriate. This is what you do on a miss.</p>

        <p>A 7-9 should set up another move -- is like a soft move. It should, typically, make things more complicated. Damage is an acceptable move on a 7-9, but usually it should be chosen by the character as one of several options, or a cost to succeed.</p>

        <p>A goblin pops out from behind a rock and hurls a javelin at your head, Felix. What do you do?</p>

        <p>You see a pack of goblins throwing stones. Augustine, one of the rocks bounces off your helmet and you see stars. Samwise, a rock hits you in the shoulder and your arm goes numb and tingly. Perkin, what are you doing?</p>

        <p>New to Dungeon World, read most of the book. I am GM&#39;ing a Fate Core game right now where I have used on occasion (not making a habit out of it by any means) attacks that cannot be defended because the NPC&#39;s have no way of anticipating. One such example was a sniper shot from blocks and blocks away with a silenced weapon. It&#39;s a post-apoc game like Mad Max meets Blade Runner. Sometimes it&#39;s just a GM&#39;s discretion I think as long as it&#39;s useful for everyone ya know. Hope that&#39;s helpful.</p>

        <p>Remember that you make a move <b>whenever the players look to you to see what happens</b> not just when they fail a move.<br /><br />So you may use <b>show signs of an approaching threat</b>: &quot;you hear a strange chattering and scurrying in the darkness, like dozens of small creatures running about in the dark, plotting mischief and trouble. <b>What do you do?&quot;</b><br /><br /></p>

        <p>Why don&#39;t you just handle it like the fiction dictates?</p>

        <p>Doesn&#39;t the &quot;Show signs of an approaching threat&quot; move cover this? You can have goblins harass them as part of that move.</p>
