Hirelings: should they &quot;improve&quot;?<br /><br />A player asked me: &quot;What about my hireling? Does he level too?&quot;<br />That&#39;s a nice question that as far as I know isn&#39;t covered by core rules.<br />I thought, like, adding a skill point every time the related character level ups could be nice. What do you think?

        <p>When your hireling prevailed despite overwhelming odds, they gain another point to distribute between their skills. <br /><br />When you spend time and effort, training with a hireling, they gain 1 point in a skill related to your class. <br /><br /><br />Works as custom moves.</p>

        <p>Maybe a bit too strong, if you ask me. And kind of pointless. Hirelings are meant to be disposable, right? Every <i>miss</i> result is an opportunity to kill or seriously maim a Hireling. They don&#39;t tend to last long.<br /><br />If one is lucky enough to survive an adventure though, then give him all the points you can justify :)</p>

        <p>Maybe tag them like items?</p>

        <p>I don&#39;t tell them the stats so if I want them to get better they do. 1 point per level works if they have multiple stats. One stat probably makes them too strong to fast... maybe meh</p>

Priests don&#39;t work but I would probably change it to &quot;If your wounds are tended by a priest gain +1 to last breath and heal all your hit points when making camp&quot;  if I ever used one. Protectors I feel take up too much screen time unless you had a small party or they&#39;re directly controlled by the player(which I feel makes them the players property and makes screwing with them a much harder move. (Hard moves can surprise the player but if they leave the player feeling violated something weird is happening)<br />trackers and warriors work fine unless you&#39;re OCD</p>

        <p>Kasper, hirelings might be disposable in your game, but they&#39;re not in mine. I see nothing that suggests they&#39;re <b>meant</b> to be.</p>

The &quot;to the players they are a resource&quot; part specifically helped that.</p>
