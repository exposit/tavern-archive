I have had this idea for creating a dungeon for DW that has &quot;regions&quot; and the rooms would be cards that have moves on them. They (rooms) could be presented in any order randomly, or linked together ahead of time (and there would be a map showing a default configuration at the end). Additionally, this dungeon would have some new magic items, monsters and a compendium class. The primary reason for doing/creating this would be to learn more about Dungeon World&#39;s inner workings (I&#39;ve only run 4 games at this point, but have been running D&amp;D and creating things for it for 24+ years now). In the end, the goal would be to have a PDF to share with others (for free).<br /><br />I created a VERY crude/basic mockup of the general layout/idea and was hoping to get some feedback on it. <b>Specifically, is there any desire for something like this from GM&#39;s out there? Not just from you, but from what you are seeing from others as well. Would something like this fit/work well with DW?</b><br /><br />I know this will not be an original concept/approach to creating a dungeon, but really this would all be a way for me to express some story elements and ideas I have that I think would be fun and would work well in said format.<br /><br />Finally, any tips/advice you might have would be appreciated. <b>I want to make this fit with the DW vibe (my biggest concern right now), so part of my focus (for example) would be making this work within the &quot;leave blanks&quot; framework.</b>

        <p>It&#39;s not good or bad. If randomness is what you&#39;re going for, anyway. <br /><br />I think the advantage would be that you have plenty of tools to fall back upon without having to improvise things, but you may not be able to craft a dungeon that makes sense if you just pick random features. I think this sort of thing has been done before, using tables instead of a deck of cards.</p>

        <p>I like it very much. Would like to see more before making any feedback, but I suddenly think about using something like this to build computer systems for cyberpunk *W hacks.<br />Eager to see more.</p>

        <p>This is a cool idea! I&#39;ve been messing around with dungeon rooms or components as &#39;monsters&#39; as well, a concept I stole from Inverse World.<br /><br /><a href="https://plus.google.com/113847025671240258531/posts/PBYN68wsujF" class="ot-anchor">https://plus.google.com/113847025671240258531/posts/PBYN68wsujF</a><br /><br />In the interest of &quot;draw maps, leave blanks&quot; you could have a question or two on each card to help set the stakes and inspire play.<br /><br />If theming is an issue, you could just create themed decks, and the GM can just mix and match them to get the feel they want.</p>

I&#39;ve been thinking, &quot;yea, they had some info on cards... and it was related to rooms... I really should find that&quot;. Excellent, thanks! Great ideas/feedback as well, thank you ;)</p>
