Brutal, brutal session last night. I showed the group the DEFINITION of Hard Moves. On our private forum they&#39;ve been collecting the stuff lost after the big throwdown with the dwarf creating a gate to Hades under the command of an ancient Demon. The accounting so far has them losing:<br /><b>Dwarven Wizard</b> lost:<br />Awesome magic staff<br />Eye of Ptah<br />1 point Str, Dex, and Con<br />Unknown magic oil<br />19 uses of Bag of Books<br />1 book of ciphers<br />Multiple scrolls of magic lore (not spells)<br />Multiple scrolls of Vulpe history<br />Multiple dwarven spellbooks<br />Multiple books of dwarven magic lore<br />Dozens of gold canopic jars (we might have sold these for the some of the funds)<br />Canopic jar containing lungs of Daughter of Beset<br />200 Coin<br />5000 Coin (I imagine this is a group fund...we didn&#39;t each have 5K coin in treasures, did we?)<br />Potion of Longevity<br />Flask of Breath<br />+1 Kopesh<br /><br /><b>Halfing Ranger</b> lost:<br />Right Arm<br />Shield<br />Sling and all ammo<br /><br /><b>Elvish Namer</b> lost:<br />Life (but made Last Breath Move)<br />A Man&#39;s Not Dead While His Name is Spoken Move<br />Doctor&#39;s Kit<br /><br /><b>Human Barbarian</b> lost:<br />Life (but regained it after making a Bargain with Death)<br />200 Coin<br />All his spears<br />And a little of his free will (due to Death&#39;s Bargain)<br /><br /><b>Human Noble</b> lost:<br />Consciousness (in induced coma due to &quot;friendly fire&quot; poisoning)<br />An estate<br />9/10s of his Retinue<br />About 10k in Coin and valuables in the Estate<br />Most of his super nice plate mail&#39;s Armor Rating (via Armor Mastery)<br /><br />In all, a good session. :D

        <p>They did manage to off the Demon and close the gate. Of course, the world is far from safe. :D</p>
