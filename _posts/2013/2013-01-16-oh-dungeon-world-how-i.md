        <p>A thing of beauty. Similarly, my wife has now joined my regular gaming group as we play Dungeon World and she&#39;s loving it! She hasn&#39;t done much roleplaying before either (just a few sessions of Dragon Age, a session of Fiasco, and a couple of sessions of Mouse Guard), but she&#39;s taken to Dungeon World like a fish to water. I originally wanted to start her out with D&amp;D proper, but could never settle on an edition. Dungeon World ended up being the perfect fit by a mile. She&#39;s getting the D&amp;D experience without the cruft and is having a blast.</p>

It seems DW was the better fit here too :)</p>

        <p>I married a game-allergic girl. The only game we managed (me and the kids) to have her play was Rory&#39;s Story Cubes.<br /><a href="http://www.storycubes.com/products/rorys-story-cubes/" class="ot-anchor">http://www.storycubes.com/products/rorys-story-cubes/</a></p>
