I was telling my friend about my recently-released pack, which is all about an adventure on a boat. He suggested the next one could be a continuation of the first - ie a series of fronts, adversaries etc. around when/where the boat lands.<br /><br />To me, the same Dungeon World adventure could end in radically different places, depending on the GM and the players, so why try and railroad the GM by linking adventures together?<br /><br />So personally I disagreed, but I know a few of you here have picked the pack up and I&#39;d be interested to hear your thoughts. (If you haven&#39;t, I&#39;ve just dropped the price to $0.99.)

        <p>This post reminded me to go buy this, and I&#39;m totally in love. I was <i>going</i> to do a lot of one-shots at GenCon that were about a battle, but now I think I&#39;ll split them 50/50 battle/voyage.<br /><br />Oh, and the name. That name. Wonderful.</p>

        <p>Wow! Thanks for the positive response Sage, I&#39;m stoked you like it and hope you enjoy playing it at GenCon. (I won&#39;t be there sadly).<br /><br />Thanks to everyone who&#39;s picked up the pack since this post, by the way - let me know what you think!</p>
