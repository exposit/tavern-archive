Are there any fillable pdf or Google Drive character sheets floating around yet? I&#39;m looking for one of each of the base classes to provide to players during a hangout game. Not everyone can print or markup a pdf.

        <p>Google Drive Doc Character sheets.<br />These are just the core classes.  I didn&#39;t make these; credit is on the sheets.  They were made for the an older version of DW but I have updated them.  I plan to add a tab with all the moves, but as long as you have the pdf&#39;s you can cut and paste them as you gain access to them.<br /><br /><a href="https://docs.google.com/folder/d/0B05-2PdMTEo8ZWU2SWQ4WVFBRjg/edit?usp=sharing" class="ot-anchor">https://docs.google.com/folder/d/0B05-2PdMTEo8ZWU2SWQ4WVFBRjg/edit?usp=sharing</a> </p>

        <p>Just wanted to say I&#39;ve been using these for my current campaign.  They work pretty well.. I ended up copying the move text directly next to the description. It&#39;s been super helpful.</p>

        <p>Glad to hear it.  I updated them about 12 hours ago to include a page with the basic and special moves as well.  Pretty much everything right there now.</p>
