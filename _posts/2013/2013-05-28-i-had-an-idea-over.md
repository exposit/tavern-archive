I had an idea over the weekend on how to deal with magic weapons in my current campaign.  I was thinking on treating them a lot like the Druid&#39;s shapre change in that when the item is created a roll is made to determine how magical it is.  If a 10+ is rolled the weapon would get 3 holds per session, 7-9 2 holds and 6- it is just a mundane weapon.  The player can then use these holds to add +1 forward to hit, or maybe +2 damage or whatever would be fictionally accurate for that particular weapon.  The bonus would be determined before the weapon was created and can&#39;t change from session to session.<br /><br />What do you think?

        <p>Holds per session are good. +1 forward and damage bonuses are boring. Switch it to moves like &quot;pierce magical protection&quot;, &quot;cut in half&quot;, &quot;deflect a sure blow&quot;, &quot;fight by itself&quot; and so on.</p>

        <p>I like your move but it feels to me more like a ritual that one would do to a mundane weapon. Like a ritual of blessing/cleansing/sacrifice to give their weapon the powers from the hold.<br /><br />Personally I&#39;d use something like this in the fiction. Have the characters go on an adventure and at the end of it they have the option to learn the ritual and can choose it as their move on the next level. Maybe have it be the starting move for a compendium class &quot;The Blademaster&quot; or something.<br /><br />I like the move, but not as &quot;this is how magic weapons function&quot; mechanics, but I think it&#39;s got lots more &quot;meat&quot; as a player move.</p>

        <p>What I don&#39;t want is a weapon that is always +1 to hit.  I feel that making it impossible to miss is not fun.  I like your added ideas, and will shy away from the +1 to hit forward and more of the &quot;cut in half&quot;, &quot;kick ass&quot; etc.</p>

        <p>I&#39;d handle it exactly like I handle druid shapeshifting move &quot;tear in half&quot;. That means, spend the hold and enemy is cut, just like that. But in your game it&#39;s your call!</p>
