A player in my &#39;Arabian knights&#39; style DW game wanted to play An Alchemist, and we settled on the Wizard as the closest choice. I have been working on making The Alchemist class for him and this is my current Draft.<br />I used the Mage and the Artificer from the DW Alternative Playbooks as my basis. <br />What do people Think? Any Suggestions? I&#39;m particularly keen for Advanced Move ideas and possibly better Racials.

        <p>Please excuse my Terrible spelling and Grammar, it&#39;s only a draft and I&#39;ll work on these mistakes once I&#39;m happy with it. </p>

        <p>I think for Resupply on a 7-9 I would have them choose 2 of 4 below from options like:<br /><br />Doesn&#39;t Take Longer Than Expected<br />The supplies are of good quality<br />You don&#39;t gain undue notice <br />You don&#39;t break your equipment <br /><br />I always like the lists where the ones you don&#39;t pick nip you in the bum by default.<br /><br />The limit on three empowered potions seems like an arbitrary mechanical limit that doesn&#39;t tie into the fiction.<br /><br />Overall, I love the potion brewing.  Seems like the Dynamic potions could add <i>a lot</i> of interest to the plot!<br /><br />I think if you&#39;re going to have an alchemist, one of your advanced moves has got to be Lead Into Gold, right?</p>

        <p>Thank you. Flipping the options on supply like u suggested is something i&#39;ll defiantly give some thought.<br /><br />Lead to gold and Elixir of life are prob going to be advanced moves, I just haven&#39;t been focusing my efforts on those yet.<br /><br />The three potions limit IS at the end of the day an arbitrary limit.  But without making them much harder to make I just can see how to keep them balanced otherwise. The group could save a big stockpile of &#39;+1/+2 to roll&#39; potions and this could threaten the balance of the game. Do you have any suggestions how else I could handle this? </p>

        <p>Rollrng dice to see how muck supply you use dosen&#39;t seem to fit DW well somthing closer to the ammo system where you only use up resources on a 9 or less would be better.</p>

        <p>I&#39;m not sure where you got the &#39;to see how much you use&#39; part from. Unless you are referring to the &#39;dynamic Potion brewing&#39; using 1-3 supply?<br />Aside from that you roll to gather supply, not to use it.  </p>

        <p>You could always add some sort of weight to the potions, which creates a more &quot;natural&quot; limitation to the number of potions that the characters can carry. This also opens up the option to create moves around expanding the Alchemist&#39;s carrying capacity.<br /><br />My take on the Alchemist was to create a set of &quot;standard&quot; potions that they can choose from (a la the wizard/cleric spell books), which have a supply cost associated with their level. They can still brew custom potions, but that move is closer to the Wizard&#39;s Ritual move, which means the GM can potentially send the Alchemist questing for that &quot;special&quot; ingredient.<br /><br />Another idea my group had was that Alchemists have to balance risk/reward. Potions (once brewed) are essentially roll-free benefits, so to make things more interesting the Alchemist has to roll+DEX when making a potion (since it requires mixing, measuring, and other precise work). If you get a 7 - 9 you make the potion but you have to take either 1.) a detriment now (damage/debuff due to spilled ingredients) or<br />2.) risk that the potion wasn&#39;t brewed correctly. This makes the player constantly choose risk now or risk later. In the case where the potion may not have been brewed correctly, a roll is done when the potion is used. If failed the GM introduces some unintended side effect to the potion in addition to its original effect.<br /><br />Anyhoo, long post.</p>

        <p>It&#39;s undergone a lot of revision. But my Alchemist Class is nearly done. Can anyone suggest some alternate Move names?</p>

        <p>To get around the &#39;Efficient Restocker&#39; name you cold make two moves instead, &#39;Merchant Contacts&#39; and &#39;Scrounger&#39;, one for shopping, the other for gathering.<br /><br />I also think you need a move &#39;Greek Fire&#39; where your fire grenades don&#39;t go out when in water.</p>

        <p>I was trying to avoid splitting it into two moves, But I think your right about that. <br /><br />Personally I don&#39;t feel the need to make an &#39;underwater&#39; version of grenades. It&#39;s desert setting, so little water, and using it under water would just be a narrative choice anyway.<br /><br />Thanks for the input! :D </p>
