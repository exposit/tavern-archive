OK sorry, this is not a bard. <br /><br />I am working on a Clock Punk/ Time Smith / Time Bender character (haven&#39;t decided on a name yet) <br /><br />Here is a preliminary move:<br /><br />Freeze time (Int)<br />When you accelarate your passage through time to the point where the world around you seems to freeze, spend 2 time and roll+Int<br />On 10+ hold 3.<br />On 7-9 hold 1.<br /><br />Spend your hold to<br />---Take an action for free that would normally require a roll, like deal damage. <br />---Do something that would normally be impossible, like plucking an arrow or bullet from the air.<br />---Move from one point to another in what seems to be no time. <br /><br />When your hold is spent, time resumes its normal flow.

        <p>That&#39;s a cool idea! But, wouldn&#39;t they get to spend all their hold all at once since everyone else is frozen? Not a problem, per say, but it really means they get to do a certain number of really cool things. Also what happens on a 6-?</p>

        <p>Yea they would. The hold is an abstraction of the time the character has when he has frozen time to do stuff. So he can do three things or one. <br /><br />On 6-? I dunno. The GM has to decide. I was thinking of transcription errors like in Michael Crichton&#39;s Timeline, but then decided against it.  <br /><br />Any suggestions for a failed roll?</p>

        <p>I really like the idea, but one of Stop Time&#39;s hold options should be removed:<br />-Take an action for free that would<br />normally require a roll, like deal damage<br />That&#39;s flat out better than Defy Danger, Hack n Slash etc as on a 7-9 you get to use the 10+ options of one of those moves. I&#39;m not a fan of auto success either; removing rolling from DW should have something interesting to compensate!<br />I really like the other hold options though, and I&#39;m interested to see where you go with it. I&#39;ve got a somewhat similar class in the works; The Astrophage, a star vampire who consumes the essence of the heavens and expends it through godlike powers, like slow time. Also a little bit of prince of Persia in there too! If you&#39;ve read Joe Abercrombie&#39;s stuff, the Astrophage&#39;s powers are kinda similar to Shenkt. If i have time, am thinking about releasing it with Pirate World.<br />Pretty dfficult to balance the class though, if they can just stop time! Interested to see how you deal with it.</p>

I was thinking of giving him 1d6, but maybe 1d8 will be more appropriate.</p>

        <p>Instead of just taking 1 on 7-9, I&#39;m thinking of adding cost to it.</p>
