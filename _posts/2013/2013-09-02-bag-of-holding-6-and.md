Bag of Holding, 6-, and Hard Moves...<br /><br />As I&#39;m reading the Magic Items section, I started to wonder if rolling a 6- is an opportunity for the GM to activate a Hard Move, regardless if there&#39;s &quot;danger&quot; lurking. In the case of reaching inside the Bag of Holding, as a GM, would you penalize a player for rolling 6-? Simply saying, &quot;You do not retrieve the item&quot; is mundane and boring, as far as Dungeon World is concerned.<br /><br />So, what would be the proper way to handle this scenario, and all scenarios where failing doesn&#39;t necessarily mean a bad thing?

        <p>I would look at the list of moves for the GM, and see what comes to mind... e.g. &quot;You spend a lot of time rummaging through the bag, and fail to notice the skittering sound behind you&quot; or &quot;Something in the bag grabs you and pulls you downward&quot; or &quot;You pull out the lantern you were looking for, but it begins making a loud ringing, like church bells and you can&#39;t get it to stop.&quot; 6- isn&#39;t supposed to be a penalty, really. It&#39;s just supposed to be an opportunity for problems to arise.</p>

        <p>Why are you locked on hard moves?</p>

        <p>I was under the impression that a 6- triggers a Hard Move. I like the idea of having something in the Bag of Holding from a previous &quot;owner&quot;.</p>

        <p>A miss <b>always</b> triggers a GM move, usually a hard move.<br /><br />So yes, if a player rolls a miss on the move to fetch items from a bag of holding, something happens that causes more problems for them (or the party). Chris Rogers&#39; example are all good, but if you can&#39;t think of anything on the spot you can always give them the bad side of both 7-9 choices (it takes a long time and you only get something similar).</p>

        <p>Any good adventurer is going to have used a bag of holding to defeat a nasty monster by stuffing them in it. On a 6-, that&#39;s your cue to let it loose!<br />&quot;Something just bit your hand... what is it?&quot;</p>

        <p>The GM can always make <i>as hard of a move</i> add he/she likes.</p>

        <p>What Craig said. Make as hard a move as you like, while following the principles. If there&#39;s no reason to throw another monster into the mix like James&#39; idea, you could always Reveal an unwelcome truth, Point to a looming threat, Make them backtrack (maybe to get a replacement for the thing they can&#39;t find in the bag), Offer opportunity... There are a lot of great options besides adding more immediate tension to the scene. Don&#39;t ignore the &quot;as you like&quot; part of that phrase! It&#39;s usually better in the story to build up to the more direct hard moves.<br /><br />1.&quot;Something shifts in the bag.&quot; <i>Reveal an unwelcome truth</i><br />2. Later someone else fails. &quot;The very thing you need got churned to the top of the bag. You didn&#39;t even know one of those was in there.&quot; <i>Offer opportunity, with or without a cost</i><br />3. &quot;The bag thrashes in your hand and leaps away, down the ravine. Better get your rope ready.&quot; <i>Use up their resources</i><br />4. Finally, &quot;As you reach into the bag, jaws clamp down on your fingers. It seems this Bag of Holding is home to a Bag Badger.&quot; <i>Introduce a new faction or type of creature</i><br /><br />Letting the mystery and problems build is fun, and often just good practice in *World games!</p>

        <p>Reveal an unwelcome truth/Use up their resources: &quot;You retrieve the item but it is partially digested.<br /><br />Separate them: You are pulled into the bag...<br /><br />Offer them an opportunity with/out a cost: A former owners journal, an old map, etc...<br /><br />You can always just add some flavor doing things like the players always hear a what sounds like a music box coming form the bag when it&#39;s open or occasionally strange smells or colorful but harmless fumes sometimes escape.</p>

        <p>You&#39;re allowed to think off-screen too, although I think revealing an unwelcome truth in that regard is probably a good idea when it happens.<br /><br />You pull out a wand of fireballs, wait do you remember putting that in there? (Meanwhile, a powerful wizard is hunting down the person stealing all the items from &gt;his&lt; bag of holding)</p>

        <p>A 6- is an opportunity for <i>as hard a move as makes sense.</i> For the bag of holding, that may be as simple as &quot;well, you don&#39;t find it. How long are you willing to spend looking?&quot;</p>
