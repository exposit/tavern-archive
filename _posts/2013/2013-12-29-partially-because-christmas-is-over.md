Partially because Christmas is over and people might not be so busy, partially because people get asking for it, here is what I got on the Vancomancer thus far.<br /><br />Mostly looking to see what people think about the magic mechanic before I go much further, though advanced move suggestions are welcome!

        <p>I am loving the flavor of the spells. I also drool over the idea of researching spells that do exactly what I want. It is almost like on-the-spot free-form magic, which I looooove! =D</p>

        <p>Thanks!<br /><br />I am mostly trying to convey how magic works in <i>The Dying Earth</i> through <i>Dungeon World</i> mechanics.<br /><br />Once the magic system gets finalized I am going to work on advanced moves and more spells.</p>
