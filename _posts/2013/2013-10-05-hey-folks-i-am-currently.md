Hey folks,<br /> <br />I am currently designing a new game, based on the Dungeon World mechanical framework. It’s meant to allow an all-rogue (Thief, Acrobat, Bard etc) party with premade characters. Each character has six moves in total, all of which consist of 3 options. Each character will have four of the core moves, and two more unique moves.<br /><br />I need your help and keen eyes to scrutinize these moves! Threat and Harm are bad things, while Treasure and Equipment are good. You can consider them to be handy custom moves for any of your DW games!<br /><br /><br /> <br />Thank you for any feedback you might have! Just leave comments below on this post, if you are willing.

        <p>Good catch <span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink" href="https://plus.google.com/113864117304127544117" oid="113864117304127544117">Johnstone Metzger</a></span> , typo fixed. You are now out of the monster&#39;s reach.<br /><br />This game is designed to serve when not enough people show up for a Pathfinder/D&amp;D/DW game. In such a situation, a player (in this case, Thief&#39;s player) would be handed a small rulebook and all the instructions needed to run a simple, procedural dungeon crawl. This game is meant to be DM training wheels, teaching the skills necessary. This means that there is a DM role with defined responsbilities, however I am trying to make their decisions more limited in scope.</p>

        <p>Oh, okay. Some of these moves lean heavily on the player making up facts about the world (like whether or not they find treasure in someone else&#39;s pockets), and some feel kinda  like scene resolution moves, both of which lean more toward the possibility of GMless play. But &quot;GM training wheels&quot; makes sense too.</p>

        <p>Hey, still have this marked as something to look over.  What&#39;s the design goal?  What kind of feel are you going for?</p>

        <p>Sorry to take so long on this.<br /><br />I like some of the ideas in there, although it&#39;s a bit more focused on combat than I tend to play.  Considering your design goal, I can see how this fits in, though.<br /><br />I was thinking about this a bit, and here&#39;s what occurred: When playing a thief, for me, the best moments are when:<br />I steal something and the mark has no idea I was even there; and<br />almost getting caught.<br /><br />Now, if if that&#39;s what it&#39;s about for most of us who loves to play rogues (and I certainly do), awesome.  Might not be a bad thing to aim a few moves a bit more in that direction.</p>

I changed the basic dex moves to &quot;Picking Pockets&quot; which means that almost all characters get the ability to blatantly steal stuff without being noticed.</p>

        <p>I like the new one.  If I wrote it, I&#39;d probably put:<br />You get the item.<br />Your mark doesn&#39;t notice the theft.<br />No one else saw you steal it.</p>
