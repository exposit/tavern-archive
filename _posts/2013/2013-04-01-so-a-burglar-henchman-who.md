So a burglar henchman who was handed a copy of the DW hireling rules would read them and then immediately look for another line of work. Right?<br />

        <p>Wait, characters in your Dungeon World know that they&#39;re characters in a game determined by dice rolls? Is there an unusually high suicide rate in your game?</p>

        <p>Only burglars. And it&#39;s not technically suicide unless they&#39;ve actually read the rules first.</p>

        <p>Being a hireling in general is not a smart life decision. Being an adventurer is only moderately better. Smart people are probably at home making a nice living with something safe like being a blacksmith or alchemist.</p>

        <p>(Which isn&#39;t to say they&#39;re all bumbling idiots or something, just that they&#39;re probably not hirelings as their first choice of vocations. What would drive a person to lead the way down a tunnel of traps for just some coin?)</p>

You&#39;ll never actually find them as they&#39;re far too cunning and you&#39;ll always take the brunt of its design. Every time. Should you survive we&#39;ll try to heal you but no promises. This will happen a lot...the traps, not necessarily the surviving or the healing. Name your fee.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Oh no cost! It&#39;s just gonna be nice to finally have some friends...&quot;</p>

        <p>I wonder about that stuff sometimes.  If I were a shitty peasant and had the opportunity to risk my (otherwise meaningless) life following some murderous brigand/weirdos into almost certain death for the chance at even a single god-damn gold coin, would I do it?</p>

        <p>It was an important period in the history of Dungeon World! The Interplanar Brotherhood of Bodyguards, Burglars, and Associated Tradesbeings was a force to be reckoned with.<br /><br />More seriously, one of the games I&#39;m running is pretty hireling-heavy, and they get beaten to hell. Hirelings are born to die, or to force the PCs to make tough choices to protect them. This is a feature, as hirelings are also potent enhancers of PC abilities.<br /><br />And for what it&#39;s worth, the burglar&#39;s not really all that much worse off than the adept, the protector, or the warrior. These are not good jobs, but if you outlive a PC, there&#39;s a chance you could become a PC yourself! (Pay no attention to the fact that a PC just died. I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll do better.)</p>
