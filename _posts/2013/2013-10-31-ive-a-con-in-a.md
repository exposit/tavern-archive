I&#39;ve a con in a couple of weeks and will be running several sessions of DW. In between these session, I am going to run the fun little game below - The Eeevillll! where A Kid, his Stuffed Best Friend and their Toy Allies must thwart a great Eeevillll!!!  For Tone and Frame of Reference think Calvin and Hobbes, Toy Story, Winne the Pooh and Rugrats.<br /><br />This is just a rough front that I kicked out in an hour while the muse hit me. Play books and rules changes will come later.<br /><br />Comment as you will.

        <p>The Eeevillll!!!<br />Description and Cast<br />A Kid, his Stuffed Best Friend and their Toy Allies must thwart a great Eeevillll!!!  For Tone and Frame of Reference think Calvin and Hobbes, Toy Story, Winne the Pooh and Rugrats.<br />•	The Kid – boy or girl, aged 5 to 8.<br />•	The Stuffed Best Friend – Beloved and Loyal.<br />•	Toy #1 and Toy #2 – Well played with and Eager to Help Out.<br />•	Mom and Dad– Yes, they love you, but you still need to get your homework done.<br />•	Becky or Chet – older sibling who taunts and tattles on you.<br />•	The Eeevillll! – Whatever it is, it’s BAD! Like BAD way beyond cat poop in the sand box or Aunt Edna’s hairy kisses.<br />Stakes<br />•	There is only one – thwart the Eeevillll!<br />Danger #1<br />Your Family (Misguided Good)<br />Impulse:  To do what is “right” no matter the cost – which means the Kid must eat vegetables, wash behind his ears and do Homework, even on the Sunniest and most fun-filled day of the Summer.<br />Grim Portents<br />•	Mom\Dad yells to check on “your progress”<br />•	Becky\Chet impede you from addressing the Eeevillll!<br />•	Aunt Edna arrives with a Jello-mold. You are ordered to “be nice, eat some Jello and go sit on the couch and visit”.<br />•	You are in deep trouble and are sent to your room. <br />Impending Doom (Enslavement)<br />After a stern talk from Dad, your exploits are at an end. The Eeevillll! wins.<br />Danger #2<br />The Eeevillll! (Construct of Law)<br />Impulse: To eliminate perceived disorder - which in this case means taking away your fun.<br />Grim Portents<br />•	The Eeevillll! taunts you.<br />•	The Cat – who works for the Eeevillll!- is spying on you.<br />•	The “Kid who never leaves” pays you a visit.<br />•	The Eeevillll! attacks directly<br />Impending Doom (Tyranny)<br />You are physically hurt\sick or “in an enormous amount of trouble, young man” and are sentenced to your room with a heavy allotment of Chores.  The Eeevillll! wins.</p>

        <p>Great idea! Possibly a toy box that holds some useful items to help him ensure that grim portents don&#39;t come to pass? What if he needed to go fetch the key to the garage from his dads room so that he can use some tools to rig traps to maybe trip grandma and have her spill her jello mold. Just ideas :P</p>
