I&#39;m so jealous of all these folks getting their DW books, t-shirts, pamphlets, pins, and other items!  I found out about the Kickstarter too late.  =(<br /><br />I hope the DW softcover will be in stores soon!

        <p>Same here. I was long term unemployed during the drive and am weeping at the lost opportunity.</p>

        <p>I didn&#39;t even know about it until after it was over.  Shame on me for living on the wrong side of the world.  Anyway, I&#39;ve got what is available and look forward to when I can get more of those nice bonus items as well.</p>

        <p>Ha!  I was reading your note and feeling like we were in it together as I see all these pictures of people getting theirs while I&#39;m still waiting!  And then I realized you&#39;re not waiting.  Oops.  So I suppose I&#39;ll be doing a happy dance in a day or few and you&#39;ll still be bummed.  Sorry.  :(</p>
