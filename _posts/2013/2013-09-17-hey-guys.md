Hey guys! I had a thought last night: what if you played the monsters? Now, I know that <span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink" href="https://plus.google.com/116619544191940331555" oid="116619544191940331555">Krusty Wightbred</a></span> did this with Number Appearing (and I actually used some of the names in there for the playbook), but the races in there were primarily about being a Troll <i>Fighter</i> or a Vampire <i>Thief</i>. This is about being a monster, period. The primary mechanic (defining your kind) is taken straight from the monster creation rules.<br /><br />And so I turn to you with a few questions:<br />- How can I make Instincts feel more like Instincts and less like Alignments?<br />- Should I keep the weapons and armor as is, or add in those sections to the monster creation part (define your weapon and add the tags)?<br />-Advanced moves. I&#39;m having a bit of a hard time with advanced moves, which is a shame, since I feel the core concept is really strong. Can you guys come up with anything?<br /><br /><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1U2grxF0gXn-nufV_X5d-U9RUMSdA1FtTuDpM4thjWd8/edit?usp=sharing" class="ot-anchor">https://docs.google.com/document/d/1U2grxF0gXn-nufV_X5d-U9RUMSdA1FtTuDpM4thjWd8/edit?usp=sharing</a>

        <p>This idea is awesome, but I&#39;m also having trouble seeing how you&#39;d work in advanced moves without keeping them extremely vague, since part of the whole point is the player creating the monster!<br /><br />Perhaps if players chose 1-2 &quot;special qualities&quot; (like in monster creation) from a big list (fire breathing, winged, immortal, spines, poisonous, etc.) along with 1-2 weaknesses from a big list (fire vulnerability, undead, hates the light, chaotic magic, etc.) ... maybe those could be worked in somehow. For example, a traditional troll player could choose something along the lines of &quot;regeneration&quot; for the upside and &quot;vulnerable to fire&quot; on the downside, but these could be mixed around if the player wants to create a new species.<br /><br />Then some of your advanced moves could play around with that system, like &quot;you discover new talents you never knew were possible - take an additional special quality&quot; or &quot;take an extra weakness, but gain X in exchange (bigger damage dice, an additional hireling, etc)&quot;.<br /><br />Might not be enough for a full list of advanced moves but it could be a place to start.</p>
