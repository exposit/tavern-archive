 <a rel="nofollow" class="ot-hashtag" href="https://plus.google.com/s/%23bardweek/posts">#bardweek</a>   <br /><br />EDIT: Added the Axe as a magic item below the CC.<br /><br />This is the last CC in the <b>Bardic Compendium Class Contest</b>. <span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink" href="https://plus.google.com/105474339582381748699" oid="105474339582381748699">James Hawthorne</a></span> was so kind to provide me with a concept, which was Hair Metal. I think I&#39;m going for some artistic freedom here and go all in for Heavy Metal...<br /><br /><b>The Headbanger</b><br /><br />When you <i>have acquired the fabled Six Stringed Axe of Metalocalypse and it considers you strong and worthy</i> you may take the following move the next time you level:<br /><br /><b>Headbanging</b><br />When you <i>head bang violently while playing a raging solo on the Axe</i> as a part of your Arcane Performance, all bonus damage dice granted to the ally is increased to d6&#39;s.<br /><br />Once you&#39;ve taken “Headbanger,” the following moves count as class moves for you. In addition to your normal list of moves, you may choose from this list when you gain a level.<br /><br /><b>Thunderstruck</b><br />When you <i>play an electrifying riff on the Axe</i> choose an enemy in <i>near</i> range and roll+STR. On a hit lightning jolts forth from the Axe. On a 7-9 you and the enemy is <i>stunned</i>. On a 10+ you aren&#39;t <i>stunned</i> and you deal your damage ignoring armor.<br /><br /><b>Painkiller</b><br />When you <i>heal someone while playing on the Axe</i>, you roll the healing dice twice and take the higher result.<br /><br /><b>Dawn of Victory</b><br />When you  _play a Song of Victory on the Axe after emerging victorious after a violent battle_ roll+STR. On a hit the Gods of Metal are pleased by your slaughter. On a 7-9 you and your allies are reinvigorated and heals 1d8 hit points. On a 10+ you and your allies also take +1 forward to Hack &amp; Slash.<br /><br />----<br /><br /><b>The Six Stringed Axe of Metalocalypse</b><br /><br />This axe was a gift from the Gods of Metal to mortalkind at the dawn of the Age of Metal. It is said that when it descended from the heavens, demons fled in terror and the skies where filled with lightning and the music of angels. Badass angels of demonslaying.<br /><br />In the hands of a normal person, it is just an regular axe with the <i>close</i> tag, although it can be played as a lute due to its strings. In the hand of a Bard however, it measures his worth. If it deems him worthy and strong, it will reveal it&#39;s true power and teach him songs of Metal. It also grows in size and gains the <i>reach</i> and <i>two-handed</i> tags as well.<br /><br />----<br />Bonus: Who can find the most metal references in the above?

        <p>Painkiller could also work like invigorate. You are not getting better at healing, your healing makes people more metal.</p>

        <p>This is awesome! Some quick notes:<br />Thunderstruck is currently strictly better than H+S; I&#39;d clarify the trigger to &quot;When you <i>spend a few moments playing an electrifying riff</i>&quot;<br />Actually, on second thoughts that&#39;s probably not necessary; it&#39;s already part of the move that you have to play a riff. Hrm!</p>

        <p>How is Thunderstruck better then H&amp;S? On a 7-9 you don&#39;t get to deal damage. With H&amp;S you do. <br />You do not take damage back though. </p>

        <p>True, you don&#39;t get to deal damage, but I reckon stunning them on a 7-9 without risk is probably better than dealing damage and also taking it. The 10+ result of stunning them <i>and</i> dealing damage is better than just dealing damage!</p>

        <p>Maybe I should make the 7-9 &quot;you and the targets are both stunned&quot;, and the 10+ into &quot;the target is stunned and you deal your damage, ignoring armor?&quot;</p>

        <p>That sounds balanced and pretty funny, as you&#39;re essentially taking a moment to appreciate just how awesome your last riff was! I was wrong though: I reckon it&#39;s much better as the basic version. As long as the trigger states you play a riff, that&#39;ll take a bit longer than a normal H+S to pull off, so you&#39;re limiting the move fictionally there.</p>

        <p>Yeah, I was kind of thinking that as well initially, but I do take peoples concerns seriously.<br /><br />When I wrote I just thought that it was one of those things to be decided at the individual table, but that&#39;s just lazy design I guess ;)</p>

        <p>but you can do it from range. Stunning both of you sounds interesting ^^ <br />Maybe on a 10+ you can only stun them and deal your damage or stun yourself too so that you can d10 damage. </p>

        <p>As the move deals damage <i>ignoring armor</i> and the bard has three chances to buy static damage modifiers through multiclassing, then I think that&#39;s maybe a bit <i>too</i> good.<br /><br />With one multiclassing, you take the fighter +1d4 damage for example, making you deal d6+d4 damage ignoring armor. That&#39;s pretty good.<br /><br />I should maybe also add that the attack is at <i>near</i> range... Long range is just too good for something like that I think...</p>

        <p>I actually like the trigger on Thunderstruck. You literally can&#39;t play an electrifying riff on the Axe without shooting lightning...</p>
