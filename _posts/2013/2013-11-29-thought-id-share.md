Thought I&#39;d share. ;)<br />Comments very welcome!<br /><br />This is for a Star Wars campaign I&#39;m going to run by modifying <i>Star Worlds: Streets of Mos Eisley Playset</i>, by Zwolfa the Hutt. <br /><br />My modifications include:<br />• Using bonds and alignment (renamed &quot;purpose&quot;) as a means of gaining hero points (you also gain one when the GM makes a hard move against you).<br />• Using DW&#39;s standard ability scores instead of those used in Star Worlds.<br />• Modifying the move structure as follows: Primary move of the game is <b>roll when you attempt something risky or opposed</b>, add in Aid or Interfere, Bolster, Spout Lore, Discern Realities, and model hyperspace journeys after Undertake a Perilous Journey.

        <p>Revision: I renamed &quot;Purpose&quot; to &quot;Destiny&quot; as that seems to fit previous RPGs better.</p>

        <p>Star Worlds was probably the best expression of SW using the *World rules, but I still don&#39;t prefer classes in my SW game.<br /><br /><span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink" href="https://plus.google.com/117033915544635907540" oid="117033915544635907540">Ryan M.

        <p>I haven&#39;t, no. <br /><br />I play very loose with class. I like how Star Worlds does it. Each class feels like a category of selectable traits (feats, really) rather than a hard and fast structure like we see in other games. Damage doesn&#39;t rely on class, neither does your health. <br /><br />I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll be asking people to stick to their class after lvl 1. Just select an appropriate trait. Maybe not entirely balanced, but, meh.</p>
