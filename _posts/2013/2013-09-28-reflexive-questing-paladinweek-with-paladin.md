<b>Reflexive Questing</b> <br /> <a rel="nofollow" class="ot-hashtag" href="https://plus.google.com/s/%23PaladinWeek/posts">#PaladinWeek</a>  <br /><br />With Paladin Quests there are 2 extremes. Big-longass quests that dedicated what the game will be about for the whole group or reflexive/instant questing. <br />The first is a problem because it dictates a lot of things for the other characters, the second one breaks the quest move. <br /><br />Here is an example of what might happen.<br /><br />GM: there is a patrol of Dark-Elves approaching you on Lizard Mounts!<br />Wizard: <b>spouts lore</b><br />GM: *tells something about extremly wicked and deadly Dark-Elf poison<br />Paladin: &quot;In the name of Anor! I will slay these Dark Elves, a great blight of the land. And i want immunity to their poison and a sense of dircetion to them so that i can find them even in darkness.&quot; <br /><br />This is basically for 1 fight. The restrictions of holy vows won&#39;t hit you as much. You will use mostly honorable tactics anyway i think and the others aren&#39;t of much use either. <br />So just declaring Quests for a short instant bonus is a really cheap trick. <br />Nothing in the game says what is needed to dedicate yourself on a Quest. It could be a short Prayer between Paladin and God or a big ceremony requiring the Archduke of Canterbury (a sentient Owl-Bear that became one of Anors most holy crusaders).<br />Make sure you ask questions about these things in your first session to clear it up and create a precedent.

        <p>Yeah. I would say, to do it, do it. Just as shaking your fist menacingly wouldn&#39;t trigger hack and slash, at least in any game I run &quot;In the name of Anor!&quot; wouldn&#39;t trigger the Quest move. It takes a LITTLE more &quot;prayer and ritual cleansing&quot; for that.<br /><br />It&#39;s also arguable that your quest goal needs to be legit: are these dark elves really a great blight upon the land?<br /><br />Or, how does Anor react to being asked continually for blessings for even the smallest of deeds? &quot;In the name of Anor! I will discover the truth of this sandwich recipe! Senses that pierce lies and a mark of divine authority before I ask the chef!&quot; You can show signs of the god&#39;s displeasure if you feel that the Paladin is abusing his holy gift. And if he doesn&#39;t correct his ways, well, that sounds like being handed a golden opportunity to me...</p>

        <p>In light of the first point... big ass quests CAN dictate what the game is about, but no more or less than the wizard going &quot;Well, I don&#39;t know about you fools, but I&#39;M going off to find the fabled Tower of the Arcanodaemons! What do I know of its location (Spout Lore Spout Lore Spout Lore)?&quot; or anything like that.</p>

        <p>It doesn&#39;t feel like a quest to me. Surely the required prayer and ritual cleansing should stop the insta-quest. I mean, the first time she quested she didn&#39;t just say &quot;I dedicate my quest to Arnor&quot; and wipe her forehead with a tissue, did she?</p>

        <p>Puts dodgy GM hat on. &quot;The life flees from the last visible elf. Your unerring sense of direction puts the next 200 leagues away, and 800 feet underground&quot;...</p>
