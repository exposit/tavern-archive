So I know the creators of the game are into music and dungeon world. My first character in actual play was a cleric, based on a god I made for OD&amp;D which is in turn based on a grateful dead song(s). Robert Hunter&#39;s lyrics are great for inspiration. I was Jon - cleric of St. Stephen of the Apocalypse - a fickle god of secret knowledge who believe they truly know what happens after death - and the secret Garden. Took magic miss,let which goes with the idea of William tell from the song. And of course what one man gathers, another man spills. Kinda of fun, especially with halfling leaf. That combined with the song morning dew. I will have to eventually work in the dark star somehow.
