So I am going to attempt a game of DW tonight embracing the concept of &quot;play to see what happens&quot;. Not going to give much thought to the game at all, just going to turn up, get characters made and play. A kind of baptism of fire approach. <br /><br />Any tips??

        <p>Make notes, and don&#39;t feel like you have to barrel through - you&#39;re allowed to call a break to think and look forward.</p>

        <p>Good advice. I do have a problem where I think everything should move at breakneck speed, which is probably not the best way in any game for that matter. I want to run DW at a local CON in March so I have a few sessions scheduled with my Wednesday night gaming group to try and play. So it is very much an experiment!</p>

        <p>Excellent!  Yeah, don&#39;t hesitate to turn things back on the players when you are stuck, or at a moment of narrative rest, say &quot;I&#39;m going to have a beer, take a few minutes and we&#39;ll pick back up&quot;.</p>

        <p>I thnk as it is a playtest I am going to be totally open on what I am doing and why so they know I am trying out &quot;play to see what happens&quot; at its most extreme. :-)</p>

        <p>I&#39;d have a handful of monsters and NPCs at hand.  You may not use them, but they can be convenient to have.  No actual connection to a story, but for when the fighter says &quot;I know the head of the town guard!&quot; you&#39;ve got something right away.<br /><br /> &quot;Marcus, guard captain.  Knows about town politics, can give access to prisons and also some back up in a fight.&quot;<br /><br />That may be more prep than you want to do though.  I keep a bunch of these on index cards for quick play.</p>

        <p>Thanks Brian,  its actually more prep than I actually have time for tonight but I will look to do that for next week.  As I say it will be a real test to see if we can get a decent game out of pure improvisation and thinking on our feet. </p>

        <p>In addition to the above, which I endorse, I recommend using something like <a href="http://davesmapper.com/" class="ot-anchor">http://davesmapper.com/</a> to give yourself a rough framework of map to riff off.</p>

        <p>OK so the game was pretty much a disaster! I don&#39;t think I did a very good job of trying to run it. I don&#39;t think I did a good job of explaining the concept of &quot;play to see what happens&quot; it could always be that this is just not our thing. I do believe it could be something I would enjoy but I think I would need to be on the other side of the table first.  So I&#39;ll be looking for some Hangout games if there are any I can partake in. Thanks for the advice though guys...</p>

        <p>I am just concerned that from one player in particular he seemed to be very resistant.  So for example when i asked questions I got answers like &quot;I don&#39;t know&quot; or &quot;why should I know&quot; I guess maybe it I a step too far for them.  As a result I just kinda lost my flow completely and I feel the game was terrible.  In what may be either a bold or a stupid move I mailed the 3 players. Told them I thought the evening hadn&#39;t gone well and asked for critique etc. <br /><br />It may sadly just be that this is not our thing though.. :-(</p>

        <p>The problem is after this experience I am reluctant to give this a try at a con as a GM.  Will happily play but I am not going to run something that I am not confident with. </p>

        <p>Yeah I think if I can either find a game at a con, or maybe play in a hangout game that may help as I don&#39;t have another group to play with.</p>

        <p>For what it&#39;s worth, I haven&#39;t seen anyone run it as non-planned as you describe your game at a con.  I always use something like the Goblin Hole with predrawn maps, some actual Dangers, etc.  I wouldn&#39;t want to run a convention game saying &quot;So, what are you guys up to?&quot;  That can work with a tight group that&#39;s played before, but is not ideal for a short session of strangers at a table.  Just my thoughts.</p>

        <p>Yeah fair point as it didn&#39;t work with a tight group tbh It maybe needs people who are used to and comfortable with this style of game to play so improvisationally.  My group have not had that kind of experience.<br /> </p>
