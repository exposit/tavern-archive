My local game shop, Big Robot Games, is hosting an all-night RPG event.  It&#39;s scheduled for 12 hours, 8PM on Oct 5, Saturday, until 8AM on Sunday Oct 6.  I am running a Dungeon World table and already have my 6 players signed up for the session.<br />Two of the six players have played a DW session with me already, so they have a good idea of the game, but the other 4 are firmly entrenched in 3.5 so they will have to catch on as we go.<br />For such a long game, I have a couple thoughts regarding structure.<br />1 - I plan to split the session up into 3 parts, both for breaks and to let the characters level up, and probably do End of Session stuff at each break to let them resolve bonds and pick new ones, etc...<br />2 - Current expectation is to treat this as 3 or 4 &quot;chapters&quot; to the session, which should allow me to play an over-arching Front like a campaign, while still being in a one-shot real-world event.<br />3 - Because I will be playing with just the core classes, I will have 6 of the 8 covered at the start.  This will either let me add another player or two as the night goes on, or let someone try a different class, switching at one of the breaks.  Does anyone have thoughts (good or bad) with the idea of switching a class during a session like this?<br />I welcome your ideas and suggestions for this event!  Ideas for a Campaign Front, themes, etc... are all welcome!

        <p>12 hours sounds like murder! Good luck man!<br /><br />The switching of the classes idea sounds messy to me...but I&#39;m sure it could be done some how. Maybe make multi-class moves like &quot;multi-class dabbler&quot; something that everyone has access to?<br /><br />Another idea:<br />What if you established each new playing period as the next &quot;season&quot; in the characters lives? Years have passed, what have they been up to? What are they known for now? <br /><br />Have fun man!</p>

        <p>Sounds great! 3-4 chapters in one sitting is a pretty unique opprortunity, and it sounds like you&#39;ll be taking advantage of that. I&#39;d definitely experiment with Fronts: against the norm, it may actually be  good idea to have a couple prepared that you can slowly build through the adventure with dire portents. I know that as a player, I&#39;d love if there was some terrible threat coordinating behind the scenes, especially if you only caught glimpses of it once per hour or something!<br /><br />Class switching is totally fine. I reckon it would be more interesting to bring some Compendium Classes, as across the night the characers are goimg to develop quite significantly. If you want to go a bit further, I actually prefer a few of the Improved classes out there (like the Improved Fighter) as they&#39;re a straight improvement over the base book&#39;s classes.</p>

        <p>Matt Smith&#39;s idea about seasons between each session is awesome.</p>

        <p>I definitely like Matt Smith&#39;s idea about the seasons and time passing.  That&#39;s one I&#39;ll likely use.<br />Regarding Compendium Classes and other playbooks outside the core rules; I want to use only the core classes because it will be the first foray into Dungeon World for most of the players.  It&#39;s my belief that the core classes are more than adequate for a complete Dungeon World experience.  Introducing too much choice in the first session is likely to make it more complicated than it needs to be, in my opinion.  For example, if I were introducing someone to D&amp;D, I would start with classes/races solely from the Players Handbook, rather than including the myriad other options.</p>

        <p>I totally agree, keep the choice of classes limited! The Improved versions of the classes are still the those same basic classes, just marginally updated/ slightly tweaked to make them a bit more streamlined. They&#39;re largely only changed by a move or two, and strictly keep to the same character as the originals. Worth checking out, but not a big difference if you stick to the originals. Anyways, the night sounds awesome, good luck!</p>
