I really want rituals to be an interesting part of my Ars Magica hack. Any thoughts on this ritual move?<br /><br />When you <b>spend time in your lab figuring out how to create a powerful magical effect through a ritual</b>, describe what you want to accomplish and the GM will tell you what you’re going to need, based on the scope and scale of what you describe.<br />Vis (at least two rooks, possibly more)<br />Time (certainly an hour, could be as long as a whole season)<br />Mastery (at least two arts, possibly more)<br />Materials (might be a special kind of moss; might also be the still-beating heart of an ancient dragon…)<br />Expertise (you might need to skim over a book on stonework; or have a master sculptor assist you; or you might need to sacrifice the world’s greatest living architect…)<br /><br />There will be more granular rules in the GM section, but I think the basic concept comes across.<br /><br />For reference: vis is raw magic in physical form. A rook is a measurement of vis (it&#39;s the smallest unit players are required to track). This is a significant but deliberate variation from Ars Magica.

        <p>I&#39;m not sure it&#39;s a good idea to remove the option of &quot;you&#39;ll have to settle for something less&quot;, though I admit I&#39;m not at all familiar with Ars Magica.</p>

        <p>I went back and forth on that several times. I settled on this version because I felt like if the players are so intent on the ritual that they&#39;re willing to collect and preserve the beating heart of an ancient dragon (or something equally difficult) they should be able to do whatever they want :)<br /><br />In other words, rather than reduce the effect: increase the difficulty.</p>
