I figured it would probably be a good idea to write up a preview edition for The Cultist and the Dashing Hero, so people could look before they buy, so to speak. In fact, you could definitely roll with a preview version for a couple levels, before you even buy - all of the starting information is there, as well as a couple of the more interesting advances.<br /><br />The Cultist preview: <a href="http://www.mediafire.com/view/?0rjn6acspc0hshl" class="ot-anchor">http://www.mediafire.com/view/?0rjn6acspc0hshl</a><br />The Dashing Hero preview: <a href="http://www.mediafire.com/view/?5ll5p66cp36xn33" class="ot-anchor">http://www.mediafire.com/view/?5ll5p66cp36xn33</a><br /><br />You can find these playbooks on my DTRPG account, here: <a href="http://rpg.drivethrustuff.com/index.php?manufacturers_id=4996" class="ot-anchor">http://rpg.drivethrustuff.com/index.php?manufacturers_id=4996</a><br /><br />Also, I&#39;ll be releasing another playbook fairly soon, as soon as I get the art for the cover. Have you ever wanted to brew potions of your own design, have a portable library of magical books, and fly on a broomstick? Well. I might be able to scratch that itch for you.

        <p>The Cultist and The Dashing Hero have both been finished for a while, actually! Sorry if I was unclear. You can get them here:<br /><br />The Cultist: <a href="http://rpg.drivethrustuff.com/product/110884/The-Cultist---A-Dungeon-World-Playbook" class="ot-anchor">http://rpg.drivethrustuff.com/product/110884/The-Cultist---A-Dungeon-World-Playbook</a><br />The Dashing Hero: <a href="http://rpg.drivethrustuff.com/product/112061/The-Dashing-Hero---A-Dungeon-World-Playbook" class="ot-anchor">http://rpg.drivethrustuff.com/product/112061/The-Dashing-Hero---A-Dungeon-World-Playbook</a><br /><br />The Witch is also finished, but as I said, I am waiting on art. I&#39;ll make a separate post about it when I get that up on DTRPG.</p>
