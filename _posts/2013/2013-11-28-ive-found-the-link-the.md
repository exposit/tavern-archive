I&#39;ve found the link the Dungeon World Playbook Template in Word 2007/2010/2013 format.<br /><br />Has anyone already backported the core classes to this format for redistribution?  If not, is this something that would be useful to the community?<br /><br />I&#39;m looking at it from the perspective that I like editable, hackable playbooks - and my copy of InDesign is a few versions back from being able to open the files that Sage put up on GitHub.

        <p>I&#39;ve not seen it, but I&#39;m definitely interested </p>

        <p>Allowing to the common folk access to the playbook templates in something as common as Word is certainly a great way to see more good (and bad) playbooks. Sounds good. Spread the love!</p>

        <p>A word of warning: The header that contains a lot of the stat blocks is a picture, so you&#39;re pretty much locked into using Copperplate Gothic Light. If I had something more easily editable, I&#39;d plunk down the $50 for Newcomen myself.</p>
