<b>&quot;Behold my true form and despair!&quot;</b><br /><br />What do you do with a boss monster that has multiple distinct forms, each with its own moves? Do you write it up as a single monster with a whole mess of moves, and just use the fiction to determine what moves are available? Or do you write up a separate monster for each distinct form?<br /><br />I see that <i>Ancient Vampire Lord</i> uses the former method, elegantly stating the multiple forms in a single move:<br /><a href="http://codex.dungeon-world.com/monster/629012" class="ot-anchor">http://codex.dungeon-world.com/monster/629012</a><br /><br />But in that case, the most of the forms are common animals that probably wouldn&#39;t require memory prompts for their moves.  For boss monsters that transform into demonic chimerae or mythic creatures, would you follow the same pattern?<br /><br />I reckon the <i>correct</i> answer is &quot;whatever works for you&quot;, but I was wondering if there are any examples from the field?<br /><br /> <a rel="nofollow" class="ot-hashtag" href="https://plus.google.com/s/%23shapeshifters/posts">#shapeshifters</a>     <a rel="nofollow" class="ot-hashtag" href="https://plus.google.com/s/%23castlevania/posts">#castlevania</a>     <a rel="nofollow" class="ot-hashtag" href="https://plus.google.com/s/%23halloween/posts">#halloween</a>

Older than the Flood, this ancient fiend has seen the rise and fall of civilization after civilization. Always it lurks, just out of sight and mind of the mortals that serve it and serve as its prey. It weaves plots like a spider weaves webs, ever expanding its influence yet always remaining hidden. Over the ages, it has twisted entire cities into naught but its pawns and feeding grounds. Yet do not think this some feeble puppetmaster. When corne...
