I have a Collector, a Slayer, and an Artificer in my weekly group now.  Between Keeper of Curios, Slayer&#39;s Arsenal, and Jury Rig, they can collectively equipment their way out of any situation.<br /><br />I may have to adjust my GMing approach a smidge to take this into account.

        <p>That&#39;s because the Collector is ba-roken! (Broken)</p>

        <p>I mean there is nothing stoping you from jury rigging a moon destroying cannon. The wording makes it really abusable.</p>

        <p>Collector&#39;s broken in what way? I have one who&#39;s joining my next game.</p>

        <p>You know how a Wizard can ritual up everything? The collector can do the same without needing a place of power.</p>

        <p>But he&#39;s limited to his type of thing, right? Like, if his collection is antique, exotic weaponry, he couldn&#39;t pull out a Sola-destroying cannon, right?</p>

        <p>my collector&#39;s theme is &quot;the wands of slain wizards&quot;.<br /><br />...so, fair bit of leeway there. </p>

        <p>That is why you pick something like wands or curious artifice or something like that. You need a lot of GM influence to knot abuse this but also allow the collector to be cool. <br />Remember <br />. You can potentially have anything on hand, <br /><br />So an ancient spear that once destroyed the second now forgotten moon could work...</p>

        <p>Moves are triggered by the fiction. Building a cannon to destroy the moon is a fine goal for an artificer, but you&#39;re not going to build such a machine &quot;on the spot.&quot; So you&#39;re not going to trigger the Jury Rig move.<br /><br />I mean, sure, this is definitely abusing the rules:<br /><br />Artificer: &quot;I build a moon-cannon, and use it to destroy the moon!&quot;<br />GM: &quot;Uh... How do you do that?&quot;<br />Artificer: &quot;I&#39;m using Jury Rig!&quot;<br /><br />But so is this:<br /><br />Fighter: &quot;I rip off the dragon&#39;s wings with my bare hands!&quot;<br />GM: &quot;What? How are you doing that?&quot;<br />Fighter: &quot;I&#39;m using Hack And Slash!&quot;</p>

        <p>Are we looking at different versions maybe? There are two versions i have seen, one is okay and goes like this: <br /><br />When you quickly fix, repurpose, or fabricate a device on the spot,  <br /><br />the other one is broken: <br /><br />When you quickly fix or create a device without proper supplies, tools or time </p>

        <p>...I&#39;ve got the &quot;on the spot&quot; version, but either way, the move&#39;s got to trigger. If you can explain how you&#39;re combining a volatile power source, an enormous cylinder, and some sort of projectile, using the limited resources that you have access to, and within the time constraints that you&#39;ve been given, then congratulations: you&#39;ve created a jury-rigged moon cannon, and you trigger the Jury-Rig move.<br /><br />If you haven&#39;t done all of that stuff, then you haven&#39;t created a jury-rigged moon cannon, so you don&#39;t trigger the move.</p>

        <p>Also, <span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink" href="https://plus.google.com/108001625414701725812" oid="108001625414701725812">Jarrah James</a></span> , your adventuring party sounds hilarious. You should totally throw stuff like this at them:<br /><br />&quot;Hey, Collector, how close are you standing to the Artificer while he&#39;s wearing his ectoplasmic reversal suit? That close, huh? Cool. Yeah, Artificer, the astral tether on your suit pulls tight, and starts vibrating like a guitar string. And Collector: the obsidian wand of King Malice is humming too, at exactly the same pitch. What do you do?&quot;</p>
