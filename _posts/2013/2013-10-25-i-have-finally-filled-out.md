I have finally filled out my Villager class with advanced moves, and think it is in a pretty good state, at least a first complete draft.  Let me know what you guys think about it.<br /><br />A description from my previous post: The Villager looks just like a normal every day guy, and that allows him to go unnoticed through towns gathering rumors and knowledge. He is not going to be a star on the battlefield but he should be able to go amongst the common people and learn things no other hero could, not using the charisma and bravado of a Paladin or Bard but using the wisdom of the ages, and maybe some liquid courage.

        <p>Okay, after a quick look through, I&#39;ve got some feedback for you.  Firstly, I really like this class, especially for someone who wants to play an Everyman who gets caught up in adventure.  I only have a couple of things to point out, one of which is simply a mistake that needs to be rectified.  That one, the first, is that your Mob Leader move needs to be worded as a move a la &quot;When you try to rally other villagers to your cause, roll +WIS.  Along with that, there&#39;s an issue with  your 10+ and 7-9 entries - they both give you three people if I&#39;m reading correctly.  Also on this move, I wouldn&#39;t dictate what a 6- does - let the GM make a move instead.  Could get interesting if the villagers turn on you instead as a troublemaker!<br /><br />The other thing is that I would personally do away with Quick Learner and Experienced Student, using instead the Multiclass Dabbler, Multiclass Initiate, Multiclass Expert kind of progression among the advanced moves, so that the Everyman concept could be spread among three other classes&#39; moves, or two or three from one class, etc.  That part may be just my preference compared to what you&#39;re trying to express here, but that&#39;s my two cents and worth every penny.</p>

        <p>I was hoping someone would give feedback on Mob Leader!  My GM noticed that typo just before I posted, I will fix it tonight. I am also thinking I shouldn&#39;t have re-used villager to describe the minions.  What do you think about this:<br /><br />⃞Mob Leader<br />Requires: Mob Mentality<br />When you try to rally others to your cause, roll +WIS. On a 10+, 3 common folk come to your aid for a short time. On a 7-9, 2 common folk join you. on a miss the GM will decide who, or what, is attracted by your cries.<br /><br />Common folk will wield any object they have handy (1d4) and will follow you into battle, but don&#39;t expect them to survive more than one blow.<br /><br /><br />Multiclass dabbler is probably easier to manage than Quick Learner would be, but I like the idea of being able to switch moves a lot, and also trying a move and messing it up.  I will think about this more.</p>

        <p>I think you should keep Quick Learner. Have too many of the multiclass feats would get into the Bard&#39;s space.<br /><br />For the Common People, consider making them hirelings:<br />Common People - Common People didn&#39;t study at St. Martin&#39;s college, and watch roaches climb the walls. Their lives slide out of view and they dance and and drink and screw cause there&#39;s nothing else to do. But be warned, they&#39;ll tear your insides out, and your blood will stain the walls.<br /><br />Take It On The Chin: When a Common Person is punched, they can take it on the chin and keep going. Maybe even twice, but not if its anything too sharp.<br /><br />Spread It Around The Town: If you give information to a Common Person, like you they can spread the information around town.</p>

        <p>The Mob Leader one works much better with the revised miss info, for sure.</p>

The mob is meant to be temporary canon fodder, the Mob Mentality/Mob leader combo is way of boosting the Villager&#39;s damage output by quickly adding bodies (and pitchforks) to the mix.  But those bodies won&#39;t last long in a melee and if they survive they will drift away once the danger subsides.   Using hirelings makes it more permanent, and that is probably a bad idea for a move like this.</p>

        <p>Oh, then they just need another move:<br />Tear Your Insides Out: Piss off common people, and your blood will stain the walls.</p>

        <p>I kinda liked Jason Morningstar&#39;s villager concept better when it was the 0-level start before you chose a class playbook.<br /><a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/15331/dungeon-world-chargen-through-action/p1" class="ot-anchor">http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/15331/dungeon-world-chargen-through-action/p1</a><br />We have used that template in most of my games since it was sprung into existance. There is still no &#39;offical&#39; update to that playbook since it uses the old redbook rules, but we love how it focuses player choices in the first session into a class. its also very very gritty.<br />Maybe the &#39;Commoner&#39; is a better name?</p>

        <p>Hey Eric! Yeah! I&#39;ve run the slave pits multiple times, it rocks with folks new to DW :) I have used all the magic items over and over too. In one game in which we played a few sessions, the Lichking ran away and became his own front - it was awesome.<br />Here is an AP I had using the 0-level villagers becoming lvl 1 characters:<br /><a href="http://apocalypse-world.com/forums/index.php?topic=2305.msg14039#msg14039" class="ot-anchor">http://apocalypse-world.com/forums/index.php?topic=2305.msg14039#msg14039</a></p>

        <p>OK everyone, I have updated the pdf above. I have made yet another change to Mob Leader. And added a sweet new class icon!</p>

        <p>About &quot;Smithy&quot;, I think you should write a few words about the 7-9 result. Something like:<br />You don&#39;t gain &quot;mechanical effects&quot; (or a &quot;functional tag&quot;), however you can change some color about the item, ie. sword gains +ornate, or armor gains +looks sturdy, or cloak gains +shiny finish.<br /><br />Love those just-fiction things... :D</p>

Smithy was intended as a fun way to get items, without encroaching on the Fighter&#39;s Weapon or blacksmith skill.<br /><br />Smithy<br />When you have access to a forge and materials you can craft a normal weapon or armor of any design. Roll+STR on a 10+ the weapon or armor is Well-crafted (-1 weight), On a 7-9 choose one non-functional tag to add to the item: Ornate, Sturdy, etc. On a miss the GM will describe an imperfection or penalty.<br /><br />I&#39;m not sure yet, it doesn&#39;t seem as succinct as it should to be.<br /><br />On a side note, my InDesign trial ran out. So updates to the PDF may be a bit slower until I can find another good way of editing this. (I have a way, its just not as easy)</p>
