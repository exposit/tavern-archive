Went out and picked up a copy of Dungeon World from Rainy Day Games. Got a PDF from the authors within hours (and a coupon from DriveThru so that I never lose it). One of the more enjoyable reads I&#39;ve had in a while. Realize I&#39;m preaching to the choir posting here, but it&#39;s good stuff!

        <p>If you are anything like me, as you are reading it you&#39;ll be coming up with countless ideas (and maybe a few tweaks here or there!) Happy gaming!</p>
