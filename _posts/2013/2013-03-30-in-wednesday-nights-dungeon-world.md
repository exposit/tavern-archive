In Wednesday night&#39;s Dungeon World game I had the following exchange with one of my players.<br /><br />GM: &quot;So what do you do now?&quot;<br />Player: &quot;Well, I was going to start singing &#39;Michael, Row the Boat to Shore&#39; and have have Alex come in on the second bar, but as you keep telling me there are no rounds in Dungeon World.&quot;<br />GM: &quot;Grr.&quot;<br />Player: &quot;And then I thought I should do something about the goblins&#39; ballista, but they&#39;ve fired once and I can&#39;t see how they&#39;ll reload seeing as there are no rounds in Dungeon World.&quot;<br />GM: &quot;It&#39;s not to late to switch to TOON, you bastard.&quot;
