If I ever make a Witcher class for DW (and I probably will), this will be one of its moves:<br /><br /><b>They both are for monsters</b><br /><br />When you <i>discern realities</i> about someone or what they did, and roll a 7-9, you still get to ask three questions, but one of them must be &quot;Who&#39;s hiding a horrible secret here? Give me a clue about that.&quot; You just can&#39;t seem to meet decent people.
