A new special move, because this has come up a few times in my  games: <br /><br />(EDIT: on the suggestion of friend/player, made it a move where you pick the good stuff, not the bad stuff). <br /><br />OFFLOAD<br />When you ask around a steading to find a buyer for something unusual, illegal, or just plain strange, roll +CHA. The GM will tell you who might buy the item, and what you might expect them to pay. <br />On a 10+, the deal goes quite well, pick two. On a 7-9, it gets complicated, pick one. <br />-	You don’t have to settle for a lower price <br />-	It doesn’t take a long time to set up the deal or find a buyer<br />-	You don’t draw unwanted attention or put yourself in a spot<br />On a miss, the deal goes sour. <br /><br />If the steading has the Market tag, take +1 on this move.<br /><br />(thieves with Connections can use that move instead)

        <p>Here are the two moves from apocalypse world <br /><br />When you go into a holding’s bustling market, looking for some particular thing to buy, and it’s not obvious whether you should be able to just like go buy one like that, roll+sharp. On a 10+, yes, you can just go can buy it like that. On a 7–9, the MC chooses one of the following:<br />• it costs 1-barter more than you’d expect<br />• it’s available, but only if you meet with a guy who knows a guy<br />• damn, I had one, I just sold it to this guy named Rolfball, maybe<br />you can go get it off him?<br />• sorry, I don’t have that, but maybe this will do instead?<br /><br />When you make known that you want a thing and drop jingle to speed it on its way, roll+barter spent (max roll+3). It has to be a thing you could legitimately get this way. On a 10+ it comes to you, no strings attached. On a 7–9 it comes to you, or something pretty close. On a miss, it comes to you, but with strings very much attached.</p>

        <p>Well, Dw has it&#39;s own version of those moves - Supply. <br /><br />Offload is supposed to be the reverse Supply. Normal stuff you can just buy or sell. Non-normal, you have to do this. </p>

        <p>Since all the 7-9 effects are beneficial, shouldn&#39;t you pick more of them on a 10+ instead of fewer?</p>

        <p>Argh, you&#39;re right, I forgot to reverse that. </p>
