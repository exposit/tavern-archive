Has anyone tried an ongoing DW campaign but with a rotating GM?  <br /><br />I&#39;m toying with the idea of running DW soon, but as I&#39;d also like to play, I&#39;m considering suggesting that we rotate GMing duties every 6-10 sessions or so.  Same characters, same overall campaign front, but each GM could develop their own adventure fronts for their section, perhaps tying into the overall campaign where appropriate.<br /><br />I can see this working with DW, but I&#39;ve not yet actually played it, so not sure. (I&#39;ve played and ran a fair bit of AW, but no DW yet.)<br /><br />Any thoughts? Anyone tried this?

        <p>It would be super easy with DW.  Just keep adding to the world as you go and when a Front resolves, change GMs!<br /><br />The thing is, you&#39;ll all get to build the Campaign Front together and advance it along.  Plus, since DW tends to shy away from OMG BIG SECRETS that the GM keeps from the players, you&#39;re just moving from one role to another.  I think it would be great fun.</p>

        <p>Awesome! Thanks chaps! That&#39;s exactly what I was thinking, but not having played DW yet, was not sure if there was something I was missing. <br /><br />I&#39;m definitely going to propose this as the model for the game. :)</p>

        <p>Sounds like a good overall idea. Wish I could get my players to do this. Though in DW it might be a lot easier than a normal RPG to do so.</p>

        <p>I played 4 sessions in a row, same DM. Never had a long-term campaign of any system really.  Couple months with DnD 4E this summer.   I think it could work, like anything if you have the right people.  Especially if you have players that are willing to try to DM, but don&#39;t want to commit to that job permanently.</p>

        <p>Ok, well I suggested this idea to the rest of the group - seemed to go down well. <br /><br />We&#39;re looking to begin next week. Not sure when we&#39;ll do a change-over of GM, but that&#39;s when it will be interesting to see how it goes. Up till then it will be standard DW :)</p>
