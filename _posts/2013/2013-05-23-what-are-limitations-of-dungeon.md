What are limitations of Dungeon World (or Apocalypse World in general) engine? What genres and game styles just can&#39;t be done with it? What is difficult to achive with a World hack?

        <p>I can&#39;t imagine three things done with *W engine.<br />1) Games, revolving around huge tables of equipment. Like some modern mercenary combat games or several games of Shadowrun I played.<br />2) Games with scripted scenarios, you know the type.<br />3) Tactical mini-games on a battlemap like in D&amp;D 4e.<br />What else?</p>

        <p>I am using it as the basis for a miniature skirmish game and a football game. There is a lot of depth there.</p>

        <p>I don&#39;t think it would work for game organizations where everyone is playing the same adventure paths and there is the expectation that you can walk into any organized play, anywhere, and integrate.  I&#39;m not saying it couldn&#39;t work or that it wouldn&#39;t be balanced (I know we could make something work!), just that you couldn&#39;t expect all the groups to have a shared fiction in the way that a more closed system allows.<br /><br />Maybe if it was something like sliders where you expected to walk into another table with another alt version of yourself.</p>

        <p>You mean, enter the play and integrate using the same character every time? Or several groups playing in the same common game world (opposed to different versions of one world)?</p>

        <p>I&#39;d expand your first item to any kind of table with big attention to detail, actually. Huge tables of equipment — sure, but also rules-heavy martial arts (think Exalted), expanded hit locations rules (some GURPS add-ons), hardcore character optimisation (AD&amp;D PO, D&amp;D3.x), even playing in an elaborate intricate setting with some players not being total nerds about it.</p>

        <p>I think I could incorporate in rules both martial arts and hit locations pretty well with a bunch of custom moves, given time and inspiration. I agree about detailed setting and character optimization, though.</p>

It can do modern mercenaries quite well - look at the Regiment.<br /><br />*W is a certain type of &quot;game style,&quot; so it can&#39;t do the other ones well. That&#39;s the nature of any system - no system can do everything. *W is a rules light, narrative heavy game. It can&#39;t do miniatures because it&#39;s not a miniatures game, in the same way that 4th Edition can&#39;t handle a strong narrative, immersive focus.<br /><br />(And I think there <i>is</i> room for long equipment lists. They don&#39;t necessarily <i>do</i> anything, but if the fiction demands you have a certain type of flashlight, then you better have one written down.)</p>

        <p>Josh, what about Pokemon hack? Also, how do you do miniature skirmish game? Skirmishes game I know all have limited list of possible combat actions, which does not go well with &quot;to do it, do it&quot; principle. Also they generally have one set of combat rules for all players, GM included, while *W is very asymmetrical in design.</p>

        <p>The Pokèmon hack has lots of tables for random creature creation and is worth looking into for that.</p>

        <p>The skirmish game I am working on takes a bit from the football game where, rather than a GM making moves on a 9 or less, the player looses the initiative to their opponent allowing them to make moves. <br /><br />The basic set up is, when you take action roll two six-sided dice and consult below:<br /><br />10+ you do your action and you keep the initiative. <br />7-9 you do your action and loose the initiative. <br />-6 you loose the initiative and loose a model from the unit. <br /><br />A sample action is:<br />Run for Cover, move into base contact with the nearest cover you are not already in hand range of. - Roll + Speed<br /> Replace 1d6 with 1d8: if the cover is in hand reach. <br />  Replace 1d6 with 1d4: if the cover is beyond arm reach. <br />  Replace 1d6 with 1d4: if your path takes you in line of sight of an enemy unit.</p>

Sage or Adam (amongst others) once mentioned that it&#39;s just a question of keeping the questions smaller. If you&#39;re running <i>Forgotten Realms</i>, a player is still adding to the fiction when they create a character. If they have a fighter whose village was destroyed by orks, then at some point in the FR universe, (a) a fighter was born, and (b) a village was destroyed by orks.<br /><br />I think you can do that in *W. You just have to ask questions that are smaller in scope.</p>

        <p>Well, I think it&#39;s necessary if you want to run a *W game in an established setting (which all shared settings are). &quot;My jedi knight is pretty awesome, but he only <i>really</i> became awesome after Coruscant blew up.&quot; &quot;Well, my wizard is the son of Gandalf.&quot; To run something in an established setting, there are certain assumptions that are GM only.<br /><br />Less fun? Perhaps. Necessary to run in an existing setting? Probably.</p>

        <p>I see just a problem with long campaigns, where players like to see their character grows in strength and numbers. All xW games try to keep numbers pretty small, so you have limited space for growing.</p>

        <p>I think it&#39;s a question of whether players like to see their characters grow vertically versus laterally. I think a lot of new games (D&amp;D Next, Savage Worlds, etc.) are more focused on lateral growth than vertical growth.<br /><br />I do think *W can&#39;t do games with players who want vertical growth.</p>

        <p>I was going to say that the superhero genre might be hard because so much of *W relies on things working a lot like how they do in real life so that everyone&#39;s expectations line up and it&#39;d be hard to get group consistency on how powers work. And then I realized that was stupid and it would actually be really easy. And now I have to go because I have to write a thing and then figure out if that thing was already written by someone else.</p>

        <p>Actually, I struggled a little sometime ago trying to think of a way to have a silver age superhero *world game for my group that wasn&#39;t just &quot;make up your powers, then we will translate them into custom moves&quot;. But I just threw the towel and started a marvel heroic campaign instead.<br /><br />I think *world games rely strongly on stereotypes. Whatever genre you might want, the *world engine exalts its tropes and revolves around them. If I had to start a new superhero game today, I would write some playbooks based on supers stereotypes (like, The Brick, The Elementalist, The Speedster, The Martial Artist, The Paragon and so on) just to see where it goes.<br /><br />As per vertical growth vs. lateral one: have you seen World of Dungeons? You actually CAN have vertical growth with DW. You just choose/make up new moves that augment the character&#39;s power when he levels up. However, the fact is, lateral growth is funnier. Even for those who usually strive for vertical growth in trad rpgs. At least in my experience.</p>
