Planning an inverse world campaign. One of the players wants to play a walker who uses magic as his super climbing skills rationalization. Hence he&#39;ll multiclass to mage at level 2. Problem is we&#39;re having difficulty thinking up a school that lets you hang from the ceiling and is not OP in the inverse world(e.g. gravity).Â
