I just had a thought for an opening question for the beginning of a game.  Q: Why have you taken the names of the Five Great Kings? <br />I think it could definitely generate some interesting history content.

        <p>Another question I want to try and ask a player at some point is &quot;So, how did you become the King of Someplace?&quot;<br /><br />Would really make fun twist to the game to be played :)</p>
