Would this move work? <br /><br />When you perform trickster magic to trick, ridicule or humor someone roll+ CHA<br />And then you have to choose from a list like that <br />10+ 2 and 3/4 on a 7-9<br />(still unsure)<br />-you have to speak the spell in rhyme <br />-you have to touch the person<br />-it has weird side effects<br />-there will be consequences for you too<br />-you can only do a weaker/related effect, not exactly like you wanted﻿

        <p>Also because it&#39;s totally related to his Fae in concept, i would like an opinion of <span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink" href="https://plus.google.com/113847025671240258531" oid="113847025671240258531">Mad Adric</a></span> </p>

        <p>Seems fine to me. The choices all seem to be interesting and valid, the move itself is colourful and possibly useful but not unreasonably powerful.<br /><br />It might be worth pointing out that on a hit, someone is successfully tricked, ridiculed or humored as you intended, but I think that&#39;s sort of implied.</p>

        <p>Yeah. What about,<br /><br />If you cast a non-Trickster Spell, simply to lightend the mood or for fun you always succeed as if you have rolled a 10 ? </p>

        <p>That&#39;s an interesting one, but certainly not as powerful. It seems designed to prevent the move from ever being actually USEFUL, it just prevents you from getting screwed by using magic frivolously.<br /><br />That&#39;s cool if you REALLY want to do some frivolous magic, but there are probably a lot of other moves that will actually make you more effective at something.</p>

        <p>i don&#39;t understand what you mean... <br /><br />It would mean you could cast Contact Spirit just to impress the kids (for example) and it just works. If you want to do it to get information about hte dungeon you have to roll. <br />That&#39;s the intention. </p>

        <p>Also this is the: let&#39;s all have fun, laugh and enjoy live Trickster. Not the sarcastic DnD style combat trickster that stabs you in the back and laughs at you. </p>

        <p>That&#39;s the point. The wording prevents you from using the move to accomplish anything meaningful. It makes your character cool, but ineffective.<br /><br />That&#39;s not BAD, it just means that often there will be other moves that are a better choice.</p>

        <p>I understand the archetype that you&#39;re going for and I think the move totally suits it. It might be JUST THE THING that one specific player needs, if that player is the guy who&#39;s casting spells all the time just to be silly. This move will keep that player from screwing themselves over while they&#39;re having fun and that&#39;s good.<br /><br />However, for a wider audience, I think lots of people are going to look at that move and think &quot;Wow, that&#39;s fun, but all the other moves I could take are way better.&quot;<br /><br />Now, the FIRST move you posted both encourages you to use magic for fun tricks and games AND provides you with a tool that could potentially be very useful. (Being able to say, &quot;That guy is totally tricked!&quot; is potentially amazing.)<br /><br />It might also be worth a note that consequences are usually what makes a DW game awesome. Move 1 adds interesting consequences to the mix for some tangible gain, move 2 removes consequences from the mix for mostly aesthetic reasons.</p>

        <p>Again, I don&#39;t want to crap on your move. I think it&#39;s probably cool for a specific kind of player who&#39;s playing a specific kind of character type.<br /><br />If you&#39;re writing the move for a guy in your game, that&#39;s awesome. It you&#39;re writing a move for a playbook you want to release to the public, it could be better. (But isn&#39;t actually BAD.)</p>

        <p>You could include a line in the first version of the move, or make an advance move like the one below:<br /><br /><br />Showmanship<br />When you use your fae magic it is always impressive, entertaining, or amusing to those that witness it.</p>
