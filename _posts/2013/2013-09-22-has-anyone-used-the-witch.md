Has anyone used the witch playbook by Jacob Randolf in play? I&#39;m curious how it interacts with the base classes.

        <p>it works pretty well, but tends to step on the toes of the wizard if there&#39;s one in the party, due to the specialization in Spouting Lore and blasting things with magic. <br /><br />I&#39;m contemplating house-ruling it so that Black Magic works off CHA, so that a given witch can only encroach on one area of Wizardly specialness. </p>

        <p>Personally, I never let the witch use her broom to solve a problem or out-perform a regular person without a roll. You can fly - this is really powerful. </p>

        <p>Thanks for the feedback. Broomstick is the move that I was most curious about disrupting play; so I guess it varies by taste of the group.</p>

        <p>I tend to agree with you, the risks seem a bit harsh even for the price of flight.  As you say, hard moves while flying are different from those in a typical environment.<br />I&#39;m may tinker with it a bit myself. I like some of the risks with the broomstick; such as the threat waiting for you when you get there. Most of the others make me feel like I&#39;m being punished for using it.</p>
