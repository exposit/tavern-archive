Looking forward to my first IRL session of dungeon world as a player tonight!<br /><br />I&#39;m hoping to either give the inverse world walker or one of the other sneaky custom classes a spin

        <p>Just got back from the game, it was pretty fun!<br /><br />The GM was new to GMing, and new to dungeon world. She did quite well, but had a few troubles with the built in difficulty curve of PBTA moves. Nevertheless it was a very fun game with lots of laughs. We had two rival wizards who argued the entire game and had us in stitches.<br /><br />I played the City Thief, and it worked rather well. While Defy Danger +Dex does the job for sneaking, I always feel like I want a stealth move that generates hold that you can use to circumvent obstacles and sneak up on victims.</p>

        <p>There have been lots of talks here about stealth-like moves. I can&#39;t think of any off the top of my head, but it shouldn&#39;t be too hard to find with a quick search.<br /><br />Awesome to hear about your game and that it was a success!</p>
