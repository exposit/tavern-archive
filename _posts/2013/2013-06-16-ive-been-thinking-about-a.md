I&#39;ve been thinking about a more explicit move for sneaking and stealth, so here&#39;s my first pass at it. This could either be a new basic move for everybody, or a starting or advanced move for stealth classes.<br /><br /><b>Sneak</b><br />When you <b>use stealth to traverse dangerous territory,</b> roll+Dex. On a 10+, hold 3. On a 7-9, hold 1. Spend hold, 1 for 1, on the following.<br /><br />You find an opportunity to sneak past an obstacle unobserved.<br />You find a hidden way or an alternate route.<br />You have an opportunity to take someone by surprise.<br />

        <p>This might very well be the best pass at a stealth move I&#39;ve seen for DW.</p>

        <p>Ran my first DW session last night.  We did some critiquing at the end, and one of the players specifically commented at the lack of a stealth move.  I was thinking of writing something up since it seems like a reasonably common thing to try.<br /><br />Not sure about this being a spend/hold move versus this just being a pick 3/1 -- for many situations it seems like an immediate action instead of something you could carry forward.</p>

        <p>The second two options seem like they allow the player to create/narrate setting elements, which is fine in a game where players do that a lot, but not so good in a game where the GM has a prepared environment. For comparison, I would go with something like this:<br /><br />Spend your hold 1-for-1 to remain undetected, if at all possible, while<br />you take an action, including:<br />·  You cover your tracks.<br />·  You get close to someone or something.<br />·  You hide or conceal yourself.<br />·  You infiltrate a secure location.<br />·  You snatch, pocket, or conceal an item.<br />If you reveal yourself, you lose any remaining hold. On a miss, you&#39;re caught in the act, in a bad position.<br /><br /><span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink" href="https://plus.google.com/104515208359712276745" oid="104515208359712276745">Alex Wilson</a></span> You could also use a moves like this:<br />When you <b>infiltrate a place by stealth,</b> roll+DEX. On a 10+,<br />both. On a 7–9, choose 1:<br />• you get in<br />• you go unnoticed<br />On a miss, neither.</p>

(Read: zero prep)<br /><br />The options you include look pretty good! I was thinking of something about covering your tracks or losing someone who&#39;s noticed you.</p>

        <p>Interesting Bear Swarm Podcast discussion on stealth recently. I think the key issue is how these moves interact with the other party members: do they get to sneak too?

        <p>Why the need for a Stealth move, when Defy Danger seems to fit the bill?</p>

        <p>DD+Dex does the job, but something more explicit could evoke the concepts of Stealth more potently and consistently. A lot of moves are just more explicit versions of Defy Danger.</p>

        <p>You need stealth moves in order to focus game-play on stealth. With defy danger, it goes to whomever has high DEX and feels pretty arbitrary. By contrast, why is there hack n slash when you can just use defy danger? Same thing: it makes those elements stand out and become mini-games of their own, essentially.</p>

        <p>I guess I still don&#39;t see it as something my games need, given that D&amp;D certainly doesn&#39;t focus on or around stealth, while hacking and slashing certainly is a huge element of the source material.</p>

        <p>Sure, depends on the game. And the designer, too! I&#39;ve written a few stealth moves for AW, but it&#39;s never really come up in any of the games I&#39;ve played of it.</p>
