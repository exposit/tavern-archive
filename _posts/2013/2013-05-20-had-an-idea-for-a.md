Had an idea for a magical shield that snowballed into a general &quot;magical enhancement&quot; that could really be applied to anything.<br /><br />FAILSAFE:<br />The item provides a +1 bonus, but only if that bonus would make the difference between failure and partial success.<br /><br />Was thinking of limiting the uses to 1/per day or per adventure session, but honestly haven&#39;t played enough to guess how such an item would affect gameplay.<br /><br />Let me know what you think.

        <p>This is exactly what I am doing with Wizards staves. Any roll of 6 is treated as a 7.<br /><br />So, ya, I like the idea :)</p>
