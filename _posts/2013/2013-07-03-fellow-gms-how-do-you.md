Fellow GMs, how do you guys handle multiple characters doing Discern Realities?  It can get a little crazy when there&#39;s 4 characters all trying it.

        <p>So I&#39;m replying to my own question to say how I&#39;ve handled it in the past.  Depending on the situation, I&#39;ve tried 3 different things:<br /><br />1.  Take the highest roll, ignore the rest<br />2.  Only one character can Discern Realities, but the rest can try to Aid<br />3.  Deal with one character at a time, if the second/third/fourth character tries to also Discern Realities, so be it<br /><br />None of these seem super great.  Now I&#39;m thinking I need to up the risk.  Multiple characters can act and Discern Realities, but each failure gets its own GM move.  Does anyone else do it this way?  Any tips?</p>

        <p>They are all trying to Discern Realities on the same situation/person right?<br /><br />Basically number 3 BUT the fiction should have moved forward by the first Discern Realities. For instance, let&#39;s say I ask &quot;What should I be on the lookout for?&quot; And you say there&#39;s a goblin sniper hiding in the dark. Perhaps the next player may want to Volley/Defy Danger/Crazy move instead of giving the GM a golden opportunity by closely studying the sitch some more.</p>

        <p>3 and 2, especially if someone has bonds but no wisdom</p>

        <p>mh, I deal with a player at a time. No one can ask all the questions even on a full success, so I don&#39;t see the problem. If the fighter does Discern Realities and asks &quot;what happened here recently&quot; for example, I answer them, then if the Thief asks the same question and the situation is not changed I&#39;d notice that I&#39;m going to give them the same answer... some of the questions may be subjective, like &quot;What should I be on the lookout for?&quot; or  &quot;What here is useful or valuable to me?&quot;, but other than this I don&#39;t see the need to do the same move multiple times at once (while the situation is still the same). If they do, things are going to get boring, and it&#39;s not MC&#39;s &quot;fault&quot;...</p>

        <p>First, you don&#39;t get multiple discern realities at the same time unless you&#39;ve presented the party with nothing much to react to and asked everyone what they do. If you make a move that has to be addressed by a PC, you can turn to that PC and ask what they do. Second, once the first character Discerns reality, don&#39;t forget to make GM moves. Make moves that have to be addressed and you won&#39;t get repetive discern rolls.<br /><br />On a miss, you should always be looking to make GM moves, or asking questions to set one up. Even without a miss, you should be making moves as well. On a miss, it&#39;s just a golden opportunity to make a hard move.</p>

        <p>Well players can also jump in and say what they do. I look over there for tracks. I go with you to help. While they do that I go to the other side and keep and ear out for trouble and my eyes for treasure.</p>

        <p>I honestly don&#39;t see the problem in players doing the same move all togheter...</p>

        <p>DR should usually reveal something for the players to react to or interact with on subsequent moves.<br /><br />But you could always allow multiple attempts and make the results contextual. &quot;What happened here recently&quot; can look very different in the eyes of a Thief compared to those of a Wizard.</p>

        <p>Have them describe what they&#39;re doing and decide if they&#39;re actually all doing it separately or just Helping someone who is Discerning Realities.</p>

        <p>Any time any party thinks they are all making a move, it&#39;s usually one with help.</p>
