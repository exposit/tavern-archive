We played Microscope, and now we&#39;re DWin&#39; it.

Our weekly Pathfinder-to-Dungeon World game continues apace, but that is not enough! I must have more Dungeon World! That feeling started back in July, when I was just starting to get into DW and was looking for ways to cram ...

        <p>We just created a shattered world with Microscope to play DW in as well! We have two new player races, Lizardmen and Dragons (young adults, only <i>large</i>).<br /><br />We are going to have another Microscope session before we start the game! I&#39;m so excited! :)<br /><br />It sounds like you had a blast! It&#39;s a bit ambitious to create your own class, but if you know what you want, it is usually easy to get in DW ;)<br /><br />It is interesting that you chose one of your periods. In our game we decided that our campaign would be set sometime after the last event in the end period.</p>

        <p>Oh yeah, that sort of makes more sense, to use Microscope to establish the history leading up to the campaign. That sounds cool.<br /><br />After doing the hard work of converting characters to DW from my Pathfinder, making custom classes came sort of easily. I just leave Advanced Moves entirely unwritten, and each time the PCs level up we just make up custom moves to suit their characters.Â </p>
