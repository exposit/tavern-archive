<b>Spell Research</b> (Wizard Advanced Move for levels 6-10)<br /><br />When you <b>consult far-flung curiosity cabinets, kibbutz with exotic arcanists, and filch half-finished manuscripts from rival eldritch masters in an effort to discover a new arcane formula,</b> draft a magical effect not covered by an existing spell. Work with your DM to determine this new spell&#39;s level. Roll +INT : On a 10+, you can add the new spell to your spellbook and can prepare it as you would any other. On a 7-9, the spell counts as one level higher than what was agreed upon. Regardless of the result, spend a number of XP equal to the level of the spell.<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" class="ot-hashtag" href="https://plus.google.com/s/%23DungeonWorld/posts">#DungeonWorld</a>
