Hey all,<br /><br />I am a web developer and just purchased <a href="http://dungeonworlds.com" class="ot-anchor">dungeonworlds.com</a> to host Dungeon World content! Currently it is under development but what sort of content would you like to see? Already have adventures and fronts in mind and there will be a place to post your own fronts and adventures :)

        <p>I&#39;d love to see a detailed, fillable Front planner or other organizational tools. And ideas, ideas, ideas... from NPCs to adventure hooks, starting questions, fantastic scenes/locations, etc. Maybe even session recaps to draw ideas from. Cant wait! Let us know when it&#39;s up.</p>

        <p>I&#39;m confused (it happens to the elderly), but doesn&#39;t this site host &quot;adventures and fronts?&quot;</p>

        <p>Yep and I hope it continues too! It is a great community :D Although I find the lack of free adventures a bit troubling. With other RPG&#39;s we see (D&amp;D, Pathfinder, etc) you find a slew of adventures and it got me thinking... it may be that there are no real good tools for planning them out. I am aiming to build those tools :) Hoping that more people will post their adventures on the site. Heck, ill continue to post content in this community well after the site is launched :D I love you guys :)</p>

        <p>I think you&#39;re referencing my comment but not sure. Just in case, my point was that ideas that aren&#39;t fully developed adventures or Fronts are still useful.</p>

        <p>Hey Clay, no I wasn&#39;t referencing your post but I do agree that unfinished items would be fine. Maybe have the ability to set a percentage done? like &quot;How much left until completed? 55%&quot;</p>

        <p>Personally, if we could have a section for other *World games I would be stoked.</p>

        <p>There are plenty of communities for the other *World games. Primarily, the Apocalypse World/powered by the apocalypse community is the one to post on (since everything is derived from it). Otherwise, an Apocalypse World community exists, as does a Monster of the Week group. I haven&#39;t checked on Monsterhearts or Saga of the Icelanders though.</p>
