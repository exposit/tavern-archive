Hello!<br /><br />I am a very recent DW convert. (I just bought the pdf  from drivethrurpg this morning!) I&#39;ll be playing in my first game under my friend <span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink" href="https://plus.google.com/104778171237881945448" oid="104778171237881945448">Tobie Abad</a></span> as the GM. I think I&#39;ll be doing the paladin dance, which is a first time ever for me, in any system (unless blackguards count).<br /><br />As a way of introducing myself, I guess I&#39;m a latecomer to the hobby, having started in D&amp;D 3.5. I did a couple of Filipino-themed pdf&#39;s for  <a rel="nofollow" class="ot-hashtag" href="https://plus.google.com/s/%23dnd4e/posts">#dnd4e</a>   as a vampire kitten called <span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink" href="https://plus.google.com/103723249437876216124" oid="103723249437876216124">Nosfecatu Publishing</a></span>, but with a new edition for that game that has stalled for the time being.<br /><br />Maybe DW is what I had been looking for. ^__^

        <p>FYI, they used some Filipino legends for the monsters in DW. </p>

        <p>BJ, we are in the same time zone (assuming you are in the PI).  I&#39;m just saying for when you want to play some hangout games.</p>

        <p>Thanks for the warm welcome, everyone! We got to play last Thursday night - my paladin worships a fire god, and nothing says immune to fire as well as grabbing a heretic and then walking into a bonfire! Hahaha good times. We buckled when we spotted a dragon, though. Never before have I felt the hugeness of a dragon as well as in this game. I don&#39;t think we could have killed it even if we tried!<br /><br />I also managed to try out a short run as a GM yesterday. It was a short, one hour run, but basically my players managed to escape a bunch of swamp kobnolds and that crocodile god they were worshipping.<br /><br />That settles it! I&#39;m a convert. :D<br /><br />Richard, I&#39;m not sure I can commit to hangout games yet, though I do want to try it at least once. :D I&#39;d love a one-shot, or to at least guest in a game once. :D</p>

        <p>&quot;...nothing says immune to fire as well as grabbing a heretic and then walking into a bonfire!&quot;  *Awesome!*<br /><br />Fair enough, BJ, I&#39;ll see what I can do about getting a one shot going.  I&#39;ll probably do it in a couple weeks.  I&#39;ll let you know!</p>
