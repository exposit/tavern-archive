Has anyone made any playbooks or dungeon starters that are earthsea like. Do you think you would need to change the game or the GM principles or agendas?

        <p>I like the idea! Curious about whether game mechanics would change anything so much as GM attitude.</p>

        <p>Everything would have to be different, I think (stats, core moves, playbooks, magic, GM-side stuff). Earthsea is about very different themes than DW. Definitely possible, though.</p>

        <p>Ok what would change - start with the agenda and principles? <br /><br />Reading them ip through the ones in the book I don&#39;t see any real changes for these. Maybe an add for the agenda: <br /><br />-showcase hard choices and the impact on the balance</p>

        <p>Um, hmm...<br />- Make the world seem ancient and troubled, carrying the weight of past peoples and their choices<br />- Make magic seem dangerous, fickle, and emotionally and physically exhausting<br />- Make safeguarding or sharing your true name to be of utmost importance<br />- Emphasize the bonds of family and close friendship as the only safeguards against being totally alone<br />- Emphasize the wisdom that comes with age<br />- Create many places and objects of great power, but make nearly all of them cursed or double-edged<br />- Question the motives of those who seek power and the righteousness of those in power<br />- The best possible existence is farming one&#39;s garden in peace and self-sufficiency, but make characters driven by their yearning for something more</p>

        <p>Those sound more specific than many of the analogs in DW. But I don&#39;t disagree with many of them except the last. For example if he&#39;d had not sought out the magic he wouldn&#39;t have been able to save his village.</p>

        <p>Sure. Earthsea is a much more specific design goal than straight DW, though, which is meant to allow you to play a pretty broad swath of &quot;D&amp;D fantasy.&quot; If you want to emulate a specific writer, like LeGuin or Tolkien or Lieber or whoever, I suspect you&#39;ll add some more specific principles and agendas, either &quot;officially&quot; (writing them down) or &quot;unofficially&quot; (just bringing that style and tone to your GM role).</p>

        <p>I&#39;ve only read the first book, but I&#39;ll give it a shot...<br />Here&#39;s a Principle: Everything has a true name (in essence, the more a character knows of the lore of a thing, the more power he or she has over it).<br />Here&#39;s an Agenda: Upsetting the Balance has consequences (players should expect some fallout from the use of unnecessary or disproportionate use of magic).</p>

        <p>Village Conjurer, Kargish Pirate, Sailor of the Archipelago, Wizard of Roke... I should read the rest of the series, but those seem cool to start.</p>

        <p>Hmm. &quot;Maybe I&#39;ll work on this for a game with my daughter,&quot; he said, knowing he had no time for another project. <br />If I do, I&#39;ll be back. This is a fabulous idea. I love Wizard of Earthsea.</p>

        <p>It isn&#39;t DW, but Beyond the Wall cites Earthsea as inspiration, and packages classes up in very-nearly DW compatible playbooks.</p>

        <p>Found it!<br /><a href="http://www.flatlandgames.com/btw/" class="ot-anchor">http://www.flatlandgames.com/btw/</a><br />Inspired by Ursula Le Guin AND Lloyd Alexander? Sold!</p>

        <p>Sounds like a mix of DW and OSR with some earthsea. I have some pretty good OSR earthsea rules I like about true names and alternative spell casting. The trick will be to port over to Dungeon World.</p>

        <p>I think there is more in changing the agenda, principles, moves, and playbooks than just the &quot;magic system&quot;. Also not sure how to handle a player being the &quot;one&quot;. There are lot of wizards in earthsea. Will have to cogitate for a while.</p>
