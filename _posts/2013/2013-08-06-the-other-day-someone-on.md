The other day, someone on the Tavern here used the phrase &quot;brought back the magic&quot; to describe how they felt after running DW for the first time.<br /><br />That phrase pretty much perfectly describes my feelings about the game.  I got my first RPG for Christmas in 1976 (Empire of the Petal Throne, I had just turned 13 a couple of day earlier and had been bugging my folks to buy the game for me for months).  I bought the AD&amp;D 1E books as they were released.  I&#39;ve been playing these games as a central part of my life for around 36 years now, so I do not say the following lightly.<br /><br />Dungeon World is my favorite RPG of all time.  As Eon said in an earlier draft of the DW guide, Dungeon World is the game I wanted D&amp;D to be, all those years ago.<br /><br />I&#39;ve been hooked on DW for almost a year now, and anybody who knows me and my severe gamer ADD will be impressed that my interest hasn&#39;t flagged or wavered in that time.  I check out new games all the time, but in the end, I think &quot;what I&#39;d really like to be doing is playing Dungeon World&quot;.  It just fits my style of gaming perfectly, and gives me the experience I was wanting all along.<br /><br />I&#39;ve introduced a bunch of folks to RPGs using DW (including some kids, which is especially rewarding), and I just think, how cool would it be if DW was my introduction to this hobby?<br /><br />Anyway, I just wanted to share and give a huge thanks to Sage and Adam (and Vincent, and Eon and Sean, and everyone else involved in making the game, and the entire DW/*World community) for giving me this gift.

        <p>This is the best endorsement of any *World game I&#39;ve seen yet.</p>
