Hello folks, new poster here to offer up a compendium class I whipped up based on a character type from the excellent D.M.Cornish&#39;s Monster Blood Tattoo novels. I&#39;m looking for criticism, I&#39;m not sure if I&#39;ve constructed the moves correctly as I was working to emulate an existing archetype and getting it to fit in the Dungeon World rules. I did deliberately break one of the rules in that the core move generates hold that the other moves make use of, but that&#39;s not necessarily a bug unless there&#39;s a particular reason why that wouldn&#39;t work.<br /><br />Hope you like it!

        <p>The wording needs some work in places (I&#39;m guessing Thermistoring is &quot;you can Volley without ammo or ranged weapon, and Arcing can be used to boost this damage;&quot; Scinderation&#39;s &quot;you may increase the forward to damage&quot; is a horrid sentence construction). Other than that though, it&#39;s great - I&#39;ve never heard of the source material but the flavour seems really interesting.</p>

        <p>Yeah, that&#39;s much clearer.</p>

        <p>This looks great!  I love, love, love the books, and have been trying to make a DW &quot;alchemist&quot; class that is basically a Scourge from MBT.  <span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink" href="https://plus.google.com/111045827268540883062" oid="111045827268540883062">Matthew Keevil</a></span> - if you create such a thing and save me the effort, you would be my hero :)</p>

        <p>I am planning on doing a few more MBT:DW conversions, next up will be the Wit compendium class, but you just can&#39;t have MBT without Skolds and Scourges, so some kind of combat alchemist class will probably be in the running at some point. :-)</p>

        <p>I will definitely be on the lookout for any more MBT:DW material you come up with.</p>
