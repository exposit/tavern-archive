Yesterday in my new DW/IW campaign my players obtained a sniper rifle (yes we have strange Dungeon World here in Soviet Russia) made in secret military Lab Beta. The mechanic already found out that it has 12 smart bullets in it which need to be tuned to the rifle and programmed.<br /><br />Any ideas what to do with it now? Make it a &quot;magic&quot; item? A special move? Just a weapon with suitable tags? Something else? I have some ideas, but would like an advice from the hive-mind :)

        <p>Adumbrated Sniper: When you look through the scope at a target, roll +Wis. On a hit, you see the target&#39;s true soul. On a 7-9, the gun decides to fire, and its bullets are attuned to your target&#39;s soul!</p>

        <p>Make the bullets already tuned to someone the players know. Old tech can go haywire you know...</p>
