A character has potentially bound herself with a powerful entity. Specifically, Malini, a sort of Bacchus as avatar of an chaos deity. Giving this connection mechanical weight seems like a good fit for a compendium class.<br /><br />Looking around at the creations of others, nothing leapt out as good fits, but there is a good chance I&#39;m overlooking many.  Are there any relevant compendium classes that I might use directly or borrow parts from?<br /><br />I&#39;ve started drafting up a compendium class. The moves I have seem interesting and hopefully tempting to me.  I would welcome feedback on what I have.<br /><br /><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DfYkIseY6vb1RPjlg5YuRBq-JBT-vytpgY1fqK5uL_4/edit?usp=sharing" class="ot-anchor">https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DfYkIseY6vb1RPjlg5YuRBq-JBT-vytpgY1fqK5uL_4/edit?usp=sharing</a>

        <p>Have you looked at mythological menads? They where badass servants of Bacchus.</p>

        <p>The menads were a bug chunk of my inspiration, but I just went from memory instead of looking them up again.  Taking a quick review, there is some promising stuff in there.<br /><br />Drunk of Martini: Oh, I hope my players never realize that; I&#39;ll never hear the end of it. :-)  It does suggest I might want to rename the class. My thinking was &quot;one who has drunk of her&quot;.</p>
