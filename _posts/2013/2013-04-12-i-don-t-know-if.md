I don&#39; t know if this came up before but how would you play out surprise and invisible creatures?

        <p>Surprise is basically a golden opportunity when they don&#39;t take precautions and just tumble around in the dungeon. <br />Show signs of an approaching threat and if they don&#39;t act accordingly well then they get an arrow to the knee. <br />Deal damage. <br /><br />Invisible creatures well - it&#39;s invisible, you can&#39;t attack it just like this. <br />The creature is invisible and everything that follows from that is what is happening. What problems do you see there? </p>

        <p>Surprise is also great to use as a hard move. Especially on &quot;Discern Realities&quot;. Use it particularly if you have an ambush-inclined Front.<br /><br />As for invisible critters--they&#39;ll have to use creative methods (bags of flour?) to take them on, though I could see precedent for &quot;use Defy Danger&quot;.</p>

        <p>Hard move in response to a missed roll outside of a fight.  For example, &quot;Ok Fondeor, you rolled a 3 on your discern realities.  While you&#39;re searching the library for the mage&#39;s diary, you place your hand on something where nothing should be.  A pair of eyes open before you, it&#39;s like they&#39;re floating in mid air.  Something grabs your hand and twists it painfully.  Raber, you see all this go down,  what do you do?&quot;</p>
