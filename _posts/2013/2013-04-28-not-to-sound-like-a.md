Not to sound like a total fanboy or anything, but something I&#39;ve grown to love about the *World system and it&#39;s focus on the conversation over narrative is that it actually uses OOC knowledge to invest the players in the game.<br /><br />In most other games, the GM chapter often has quite elaborate sections about why <i>meta-gaming should be avoided</i>, and it&#39;s often accompanied with advice on how to do so.<br /><br />The &quot;setup phase&quot; for the play-by-post game I&#39;m in has just ended, and we&#39;re about to start actual play. I know a lot of things about the other PC&#39;s that Roklo, my six-armed White Ape Wizard, doesn&#39;t have a clue about yet.<br /><br />I really like that, because now I&#39;m interested in those characters and their goals, and I want to see them conquer their challenges as much as I want to defeat my arch-nemesis Breko, whom <i>they</i> know of only out of character.<br /><br />Meta-game knowledge is a tool like everything else. Just as you wouldn&#39;t use a hammer to straighten glass, you should use meta-game knowledge as an <i>in-game</i> motivation. It&#39;s all about using what you have, when you can use it for something great.<br /><br />I just wanted to get this out there.<br /><br />DISCLAIMER: I do not mean that the *World system <i>avoids</i> narrative, rather it ignores it and lets the conversation <i>shape</i> it.

        <p>I think the narrative emerges from conversation. At the end of a *World game you can look back at what happened and see a story that was told without any one person having absolute narrative authority.</p>

        <p>&quot;narrative emerges from conversation&quot;<br /><br />isn&#39;t that basically a definition of RPGs</p>

Lots of RPGs involve a planned narrative that is revealed by conversation, not a narrative that arises from the conversation itself.</p>

I asked questions about people&#39;s experiences on relying on nothing but improv, and everyone seems to think that &quot;improv&quot; is what happens when the players derail the GM&#39;s plot. Many doesn&#39;t seem to grasp the concept of sitting down at the table <i>without</i> a preplanned plot.<br /><br />DW goes to great length in making it easy to improvise, since monsters are so unfathomably easy to make up on the spot, and it emphasizes the importance of <i>asking questions and building on the answers</i>. I use that advice to make up events on the spot, that will later unfold as a story, based on the conversation. I often have no idea what will happen next.<br /><br />That is what I call improv, and that is how the narrative arise from the conversation, and how the conversation doesn&#39;t arise from a preplanned plot.</p>
