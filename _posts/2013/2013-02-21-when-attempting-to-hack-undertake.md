When attempting to hack Undertake a Perilous Journey for use in an ever-changing magical Labyrinth, I realized for the first time that it&#39;s really just a team Defy Danger, with the danger being whatever is making the journey perilous: being attacked, getting lost, running out of food, etc. <br /><br /><b>Journey Through the Labyrinth</b><br />When you attempt to travel a significant distance through the Grey Labyrinth, divide the roles among the party:<br />Scout: Roll +WIS to defy the danger of being ambushed.<br />Navigator: Roll +INT to defy the danger of becoming lost.<br />Quartermaster: Roll +WIS to defy the danger of theft/accidents. <br /><br />Note: A 10+ means that you are able to not only defy the danger, but also help the party.  A scout might find something valuable, navigator figures out a shortcut, quartermaster reduces rations required, etc. GM will describe.  <br /><br />(These rolls work using the basic Defy Danger mechanic:  10+ you avoid danger, 7-9 things get worse but you can still keep the party out of trouble)

        <p>Hey. Whatever happens in a Perilous Journey - STAYS in a Perilous Journey.</p>

        <p>My wife would like me to clarify two points:<br />1) It&#39;s a maze, not a labyrinth.<br />2) She was the one who drew the connection to Defy Danger, and I worked out the logistics for our game from there.</p>

        <p>Does the maze have impulses? &quot;Break up groups of intruders&quot;, &quot;Create an illusory route&quot;?</p>
