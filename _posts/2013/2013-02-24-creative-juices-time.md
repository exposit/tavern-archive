Creative Juices time... <br /><br />Using the idea of &quot;Impressions&quot; from Dungeon Starters, what are some impressions that demons, demon pacts and demon worship summon up in your minds?

        <p>Circles of sand, their lines spelling out the vilest of words.<br />Whispering from the shadows.<br />The tallest candles you&#39;ve ever seen.<br />An unholy choir of misled orphans.<br />A clearing in the woods, ringed with the eyes of the night&#39;s watchers.<br />Possessed villagers, all corrupted and innocent.<br />That guy, you know the kind - he just doesn&#39;t know when to quit.<br />A black dog and her puppies.<br />Another damned crossroad.<br /></p>

        <p>Listen to this while writing material: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5mK41-m1I8" class="ot-anchor">Whisper 32: Genesis in Latin</a><br /><br />An ally screaming and being torn apart as an invisible demon kills him.<br />A corrupted, demon-possessed bishop at the head of an army.<br />The pope and the emperor, appearing in triumph together.<br />A fallen angel, mourning in chains.<br />A massive barbed demon, astride the battlefield with foes impaled on his body.<br />Demonic tides howling outside the city walls, besieging the city.<br />A doom cursed wedding with a befuddled groom.</p>

        <p>A charming man, extending a hand, his palm cut and bleeding.<br />A fool sits on the throne, while wisdom is chained below.<br />Hair on the backs of your arms stands up, the air tastes coppery and charged.<br />What you desire is right in front of you, what you fear is just out of sight.<br />A crowd with eyes as dull as stone, their hearts are kept in a large copper box.<br />A man crying in desperation as he watches the sun set. He has only minutes left before she comes for him.<br />The spot won&#39;t wash off her hand, she rubs it idly even while she lies about her father, her husband, and her brother.<br />There is a weight of three thousand years behind its eyes. Where it used to look at mortals with greed, now it only looks with envy and pity.<br />The deal is always he same. The offer is anything you desire. The cost is everything you have.<br />The scales are balanced. On one side is the souls of one hundred and one evil men. On the other is the soul of one good man.<br />She says you must leave. She says you stink of bitter iron and the bile of prayer.</p>
