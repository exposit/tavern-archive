I just found out about the Grim World kickstarter project. Anyone here a backer that can share what this book is going to be like?

        <p>Absolutely. It&#39;s a very well-designed collection of monsters, races, classes, magical items, adventure seeds, and much more for a dark and, well, grim campaign setting. Everything mechanical is presented for DW and Fate, which is pretty cool.<br /><br />The art is fantastic, and I also think the new playbooks (classes like Slayer, Necromancer, Battlemaster) are extremely evocative.I plan on using this for our next DW campaign.</p>

        <p>It is also the best Warhammer-esque setting I&#39;ve seen for both DW and FATE.</p>

        <p>I love DW and Fate. Sounds like it might be right up my alley.<br /><br />I&#39;m also a huge warhammer fan. What makes Grim world a good fit for the setting in your mind?<br /><br />Thanks!</p>

        <p>The classes just scream classic Warhammer archetypes. The Slayer, The templar (which hunter), the channeler (Bright Wizard), etc. They open it up more to different races that don&#39;t exist in Warhammer but simply allowing only the classic races you&#39;re golden for a Warhammer game.</p>
