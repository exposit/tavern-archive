<b>Summoner&#39;s Chalk</b> (Weight 0)<br /><br />This ornate piece of chalk is infused with alchemical reagents and arcane energies of great aid in the construction of summoning circles; it can be used to enhance the casting of Summon Monster (Or other spells, subject to GM).<br /><br />When you have some uninterrupted time, you may use the chalk to <b>create a summoning circle</b>.  The next time you cast Summon Monster with the aid of the circle, first roll+INT for the quality of your summoning circle; you gain +1 to the roll if you spent a full hour carefully creating the circle, and +2 if you spent 12 hours.  You gain +1 if you create the circle in a <b>place of power</b>.  The spell is then altered depending on the results of your roll:<br /><br />12+  Your summoning circle is the pinnacle of perfection; take +3 to cast your spell.  If the spell is successful, your monster receives 3 additional choices from the list of options (1d6+3).<br /><br />10-11 High quality; take +2 to cast the spell.  If the spell is successful, you receive one extra choice from the list of options.<br /><br />7-9  Serviceable; take +1 to cast the spell.<br /><br />6-  Your summoning circle is botched, and provides no aid.  Your chalk is wasted.<br /><br />Each piece of chalk is good for one circle, and each circle for one spell; for this reason, they are often created or found in small bundles of two or three.

        <p>I like the general concept but it feels a bit too mechanical for DW. Maybe something like:<br /><br />When you <b>spend at least an hour creating a summoning circle with this chalk and then cast Summon Monster</b>, roll+Int.<br />On a 10+ hold 3. On a 7-9 hold 1. Spend your hold 1 for 1 to add traits to the summoned monster (in addition to the usual 1d6 from the spell itself).<br />If you spent at least 12 hours creating the summoning circle, gain +1 hold.</p>

        <p>Yeah, that makes sense too. I waffled a bit when I wrote it. The automatic hold seemed like it might contribute more consistency to the move, especially if you add &quot;even if you miss&quot; at the end of the last sentence.<br /><br />Either way works. :)</p>

        <p>I try to stay way from creating  moves and magic items with +1 or +2 to rolls. The balance of the game is to reliant on a -1 to +3 range to add other bonuses in and it&#39;s also just not very interesting.<br />Jared&#39;s alternative is more like the sort of thing I would be aiming for. </p>
