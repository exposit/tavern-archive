Just a few things i brainstormed during the cleaning of the apartment:<br /><br /><b>Paladin of the Holy-Cross</b>: You don&#39;t choose your own quests; they are the will of your god manifested in you. Instead of choosing your own quests, the GM will tell you what you are questing for. Choose 1 vow you have to fulfill during all your quests and 2 boons that are active for any quest you are on. <br />In addition to them you always have<br /><i>An unwavering sense of direction to the goal of your quest</i> <br /><br /><b>Simic Druid</b> Just one form isn&#39;t enough. Your shapes bleed into each other and bring you closer to the perfect organism. When you Shapeshift the animal you transform into shows some aspects of the last animal form you took. Replace one of the moves the GM gives you with one move of your previous animal form.

        <p>Simic Druid seems kind of redundant with the existing &quot;Chimera&quot; move? How about something like being able to transform other animals into crossbreeds with anything you could normally shapeshift into: roll+wis, the GM will choose a move they gain on a 10+, and a move they gain and a move they lose on a 7-9?<br /><br />So you get the creepy druid who turns their native wilderness into a mess of owlbears and viperwolves and whathaveyou.</p>

It goes on the same ground as chimera that&#39;s true but chimera is a 6-10 move. </p>

        <p>You could do them as either Alignment or Race i think but Race is of course cooler. <br /><br />I should have explained that these are &quot;race&quot; moves. </p>
