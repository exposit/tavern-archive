I saw a couple of wizard-themed hirelings and I remembered a simple one we successfully used some time ago.  <a rel="nofollow" class="ot-hashtag" href="https://plus.google.com/s/%23wizardweek/posts">#wizardweek</a> <br /><br /><b>Apprentice</b><br /><i>Spellcasting</i>: an apprentice knows spells for a total of spell levels equal to their ability score. They can cast each spell once; after being cast, a spell is forgotten until the next time you make camp and the apprentice is left alone restoring their power.
