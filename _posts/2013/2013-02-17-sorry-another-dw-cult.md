Sorry, another DW / Cult of the Reptile God question:<br /><br />For those familiar with Cult of the Reptile God, what are some good opening moves to get PCs tied to the adventure for a four-hour one-shot game?

        <p>The inn on fire is a classic start.</p>

        <p>What is the Cult of the Reptile God scenario, is it from Red Book?</p>

        <p>I was considering some sort of random determination to see whether any NPCs were or were not cultists to change it up and make it a bit more fun. Any recommendations there?</p>

        <p>Oh.  OH OH I JUST ABOUT FORGOT.<br /><br />Make the PCs villagers.  Like, they&#39;re residents of the village, not just outsiders with big swords.  Ask them things like &quot;Why is so and so a cultist?  Where did their life go wrong?&quot;  Make fighting the ensorcelated villagers feel like a hard choice.</p>
