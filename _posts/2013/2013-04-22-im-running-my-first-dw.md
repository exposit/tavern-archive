I&#39;m running my first DW session tonight. I&#39;ll be starting with a written dungeon (<i>The Bloodstone Idol</i>, which is included in the French box) and I have some ideas for the setting (<i>The Keep on the Borderlands</i>, 30 years later).<br /><br />But I don&#39;t want to rob the players of their narrative rights and I&#39;ll need some kind of hard rule to prevent me from doing so. Yeah, I tend to sit at the frustrated writer end of the GM spectrum, but I&#39;m working on it ;)<br /><br />So this is why I&#39;m going to give worldbuilding responsabilities to each player:  <br /><br /> *The Fighter has a say on everything connected to armed conflict, secular law and the feudal system. <br /> *The Wizard is in charge of magic and the supernatural, as well as ancient history. <br /> *The Cleric answers questions about religious power, dogma, cults and sects, etc. <br /> *The Thief is the underworld and trade consultant. He&#39;ll advise me on crime, guilds and legitimate commerce. <br /><br />Has anybody done something of the sort?<br />

        <p>That&#39;s usually how it works, but I wouldn&#39;t necessarily put that out there from the get go.  Just remember those things and ask questions as they come up.<br /><br />Remember, though, it&#39;s fun to switch it up.  Ask the Cleric about breaking the law.  Ask the Fighter about the next magical menace.  You&#39;ll get more interesting answers that way.</p>

        <p>There are two simple rules of thumb that will help you. They are more on educational side and when you&#39;ll learn feel free to break it, but for now really stick to them.<br />First, really respect player input in every form and detail. Even if your ideas seem better. Second, every time you can&#39;t come up with something really cool (and this is often for me), consider asking a player.<br />Also, what Adam said.</p>

        <p>Thanks Adam. What I&#39;ll do is put a post-it with these areas inside my GM screen so that I don&#39;t forget to ask questions.</p>

        <p>That&#39;s what I&#39;ll try to do. I&#39;m just wary of falling back to my veteran GM routines - my players are also old gamers and they won&#39;t volunteer narrative bits if I don&#39;t prod them. <br /><br />Our Monster of the Week series started with a lot of questions and progressively devolved into traditional adventures. But hey, working on it! =)</p>

        <p>Well, that&#39;s what second rule is about: it actually forces you to ask questions. You can also try timer and ask a question every 15 minutes or something like this.</p>

        <p>Just be aware of when you are making decisions and try to practice turning those decisions over to the players.<br /><br />Also, answer questions with questions.</p>

        <p>Thanks guys, I&#39;ll try and use these strategies. I&#39;m off now!</p>

        <p>That sounds like a good idea, I also like <span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink" href="https://plus.google.com/112484087750169360510" oid="112484087750169360510">Adam Koebel</a></span> &#39;s idea of rotating the tasks so that it&#39;s not the usual suspects that cover those areas. Especially if you thief player is a perpetual thief player.</p>

        <p>Quick update: it went very well. I got very good answers from the players and loads of material to build upon. Now we only played one encounter/scene, so that was easy. In the future, I&#39;ll have to be careful not to revert to all-powerful GM mode... </p>
