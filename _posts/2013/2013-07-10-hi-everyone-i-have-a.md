Hi Everyone,<br />I have a hypothetical question for everyone. I was thinking about the way DW handles moves and combat in particular. I was thinking the fiction first and last would work well for the storyteller games. Then I got to thinking about how to deal with some of the powers. In particular Vampire the Masquerade and the Celerity power.<br /><br />For those of you who don&#39;t know the power gives you multiple actions in a single turn. <br /><br />Since DW doesn&#39;t have traditional turns how would you convert that. Just allow the players to narrate alot of actions? Remove the power complete?

        <p>You&#39;re fast as a motherfucker. Your enemies struggle to engage as you rip out their still beating hearts. Maybe when you <b>boil your blood</b> roll + CON on a 10+ hold three on a 7-9 hold one. Spend hold to deal your damage.</p>

        <p>I played a game with a Mage with the &quot;time&quot; focus, and one of his favorite tricks was to speed up a party member to ridiculous speeds. The GM would just let anyone so enchanted dance circles around the enemy and deal damage for free.</p>

When needed, some vampires can move fast — really fast. <br />○ Like Lightning: When you need to travel a long distance in an impossibly short amount of time or complete a task in record time, take a chance but roll+Blood. On a hit, you make it there in time or finish your task, but are winded take -1 ongoing until you get a chance to rest.<br />○ Rapid Response: You use Celerity to move with amazing swiftness in times of stress. When you unleash on any hit, take an additional option.  In addition, take +1 to retreat.<br />○ Faster Than Thought: (requires Rapid Response or Like Lightning) The embrace gifted you with startling speed and reflexes. You gain +1 Blood (max +3).  If you are already at +3 Blood you may stretch to +4 Blood max at the cost of erasing your Mortality Rapport permanently. <br /><br />Here Celerity is the Displine, but the moves taken are the sub items.</p>
