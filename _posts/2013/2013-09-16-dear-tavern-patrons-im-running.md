Dear tavern patrons,<br />I&#39;m running an urban game in a couple of hours and I need a move along the lines of <i>When you venture into the darkest alleys of Apostarius...</i>.<br />A quick search here didn&#39;t show any results. Do you know of anything I could use in a pinch?

        <p>On a 10+ you spot the Ambush of the mad apothecaries before they can spring it on you.<br />On a 7-9 you get ambushed but react fast enough to be confrontation ready. <br />On a 6- you blindly stumble into it. </p>

        <p>Cool, thanks Tim. I&#39;ll elaborate on this I think, replacing the ambush by something else if needed. Roll +WIS I suppose?</p>

        <p>Roll +Dex. On a 10+ Pick 2, on a 7-9 Pick 1.<br />-You make it to where you want to get to.<br />-You come out with all your possessions still on you.<br /><br />Roll +Wis. On a 10+ hold 3, on a 7-9 hold 1.<br />-Deflect an incoming attack<br />-Know of a &quot;short cut&quot; to get away from a danger<br />-Find a place to hide in the nick of time.<br /><br />I&#39;m new to custom moves...but I&#39;m having a lot of fun with it!</p>

        <p>yes. WIS makes sense. However, it this dark alley (or other alleys) are an important thing in your game and will come up again you could introduce a new stat. <br />Call it Streetwise. If you are from the town it starts at +1. Otherwise at 0. Bard and Thief get a +1 to it. <br />On a 10+ you can choose to get the 7-9 result but in return you can increase your streetwise...</p>

        <p>That&#39;s a very good take. I was thinking you could roll + Bonds with the city as well.</p>

        <p>The game has been cancelled, so this is what I wrote for next time:<br /><b>When you wander in the dark alleyways or on the infamous roofs of Apostarius</b>, roll +Bonds (the city). On a 10+, choose 3, on a 7-9, choose 2. <br />- You are not ambushed or mugged.<br />- You weren’t followed by something unnatural.<br />- You run into a potentially dangerous and time consuming opportunity.</p>

        <p>do players know they can have bonds with the city (for mechanical benefits)? <br />However, i would put in more moves that can be rolled +city bonds to make it worth it. Helping another PC could most times be the better option...</p>

        <p>I hadn&#39;t seen your moves, <span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink" href="https://plus.google.com/114058978089705547111" oid="114058978089705547111">Matt Smith</a></span>.

        <p><b>When you take time to study the mood of the streets in Apostarius</b>, roll +Bonds (the city). On a 10+ hold 2, on a 7-9 hold 1. Spend 1 hold to: <br />- Create a diversion.<br />- Deflect an incoming attack. <br />- Know a way to escape danger, leaving your allies behind.<br />- Find a place for you and another to hide for a minute or two. </p>

        <p>How does taking in the mood of the streets help you to deflect an attack or create a diversion?  </p>

        <p>Unless the city is a major setting I&#39;m not sure why they have bonds with it. Never the less <span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink" href="https://plus.google.com/110330901807759406775" oid="110330901807759406775">Tim Franzke</a></span> the mage notices that the crowd in this street could use a party so she pulls out those fireworks she&#39;s been carrying around since that thing with the apocathary and the prophetic slug and lets fly. Rolls a 7-9 and the REST of the party slip away from their tail. The fighter notices that this crowd is edgy after their team lost that flaxknife tourament that the party rigged. Since nobody sane tries to assasinate someone in a bar fight, he walks up to the biggest guy there and decks him. It is important that moves make sense but if the flavor is good then the narrative should flow. If one of the options doesn&#39;t make sense in specific situations (something that&#39;s very noticable with an artificer in the party) then they won&#39;t pick that</p>

        <p>And yes, the city is important in this game. We went for a sort of magical, almost living Lankhmar . </p>
