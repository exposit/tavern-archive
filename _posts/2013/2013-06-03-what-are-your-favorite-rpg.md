        <p>Captured by pirates! I&#39;ve always wanted to play in a game with the potential for mutiny.</p>

        <p>Last night we did &quot;Retrieving an artifact from an ancient evil.&quot;  I will be running 3-4 Dungeon World games at our local con this August, and was looking for other ideas.  I really like the pirate idea. =)</p>

        <p>I once started a campaign with all of the players captive in a slave caravan. It could make for a good DW one-shot: Who enslaved you? Who else is among the enslaved? Where did your equipment end up? Which slaver bullied you the worst? What are you gonna do about it?</p>

        <p>Murderhobo&#39;s is a &quot;good&quot; RPG trope ;)<br /><br />A regular Dungeon Crawl is also a stable :)</p>

        <p>Whatever the adventure, I always enjoyed having a group of NPC adventurers after the same thing as part of the opposition. </p>
