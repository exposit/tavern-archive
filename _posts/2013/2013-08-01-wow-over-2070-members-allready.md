Wow, over 2070 members allready :)<br />I remember this forum not long ago barely reaching the 600 :)<br />Just wanted the share this:<br />In all this years of roleplaying, I started 1985 or 6 , it was all about rules, rules and more rules.<br />Not at the beginning, because it was like magic was happening and I was even dreaming about whatwas going on in the game (so my parents told me because I was talking in my sleep:)<br />But just a little bit later I was the GM and reading the rules.<br />And that was it, it was all about the rules.<br />Discussions about how you could build in a rule to avoid a blow in D&amp;D etc.<br />This went on and on and on for years.<br />D&amp;D, AD&amp;D, Midgard (a german rpg), Shadowrun, Savage Worlds,  Earthdawn, Exalted, Hell on Earth, D&amp;D 3rd/4th/Pathfinder, Elric/Stormbringer (my favorite Novels btw).<br />I always liked dark fantasy like elric and dark sun.<br />I never found the right rules systems for these settings.<br />As a fan of 4e I hated how Wizard abandoned 4e and then I heard about 13th Age.<br />I spend the money and waited until it was being developed.<br />Meanwhile I discovered Dungeon World and thought I´ll give it a try<br />and see if my players like it.<br />After reading the rules, in which I had a hard time recognizing I did it all wrong and how to throw all my rpg habits down the drain, we finally had a session and everyone was blown away.<br />We all, especially me, re-learned how to play rpg and got the magic back :D<br />My players are 99% casual and 1 person hardcore gamer ^^<br />Everyone! likes dungeon world !:)<br />YES, DW rocks!!! and 13th age has to go to the shelf for a while :D<br />DW is the masterpiece (not like I mentioned in a wotc forum 4e ^^) <br />Thanx for having back my fantasy gaming.<br />Thank you Sage LaTorra and Adam Koebel.<br /><br />(and according to my girl friend ...unfortunatly I´m snoring in my dreams ^^)
