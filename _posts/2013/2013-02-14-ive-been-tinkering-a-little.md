I&#39;ve been tinkering a little again, this time about swarm type creatures of a slightly larger format, like kobolds and goblins. Not at all dangerous to an adventurer by itself, you&#39;re much more likely to get killed by slipping and hitting your head on a rock.<br /><br />I like making scenes epic by throwing in lots and lots of mobs. DW handles that nicely since there&#39;s almost no book keeping, but a hundred goblins are likely to kill an entire party because of the damage modifier.<br /><br />I wanted to take swarms an extra mile.<br /><br />How would you model monsters that were only truly dangerous when facing hundreds of them? I was thinking of actually not even give them monster status, but just treat them as terrain, making it a Special Move.<br /><br /><b>Move through swarm</b><br />When forcing you way through a swarm of creatures, roll+DEX. *On a 10+ you move through them otherwise unhindered. *On a 7-9, choose one:<br />- Critters crawl up your body as you go, weighing you down. Take -1 forward.<br />- Take 1d6 damage, ignoring armour.<br /><br />Thoughts?

        <p>Yeah, I thought about it, but I thought making a move or monster tag just felt better</p>

        <p>Yeah, sounds like your heroes would be defying danger then. I&#39;m imagining a bard now, who uses his CHA to defy danger. Music can even soothe a horde of ravenous kobolds, I guess...</p>

        <p>Maybe he is terrifying them with his awesomeness?</p>

        <p>Elven songs can produce such effects vs orcs, goblins, dwarves and me.</p>

        <p>It seems unlikely to me that a player will very often choose damage (long-lasting, risks death) over -1 forward (a mild and temporary disadvantage).   Not saying it could never happen, but it doesn&#39;t seem like a very interesting choice.<br /><br />I&#39;d consider options like:<br />* the mob delays or diverts you from getting where you want to go<br />* the mob steals your stuff (GM says what)<br />* the mob does its damage</p>

        <p>Why not actually have the mob giving you extra weight? Imagine some pesky crawlers getting into your bags, pockets and even your loinclothes! That should give you at least 1 additional weight.</p>

        <p>I love the adding weight idea, used with the Encumbrance move. <br />Off the top of my head:<br /><br />If you attempt to move through the swarm, roll+DEX. <br />•On a 10+, you make it where you are going unimpeded. •On 7–9, you get there but the creatures pile on, adding weight to bring you up to your Load+2. •On a miss, they increase it to your Load+4.<br /><br />If you plow your way through the swarm, roll+STR.<br />•On 10+, choose 3. •On a 7–9, choose 1.  <br />• You inflict your damage to the swarm.<br />• You don&#39;t take damage from the swarm.<br />• You don&#39;t take on +50% of your max Load in weight.<br />• You reach your destination.</p>

        <p>I love that idea - having the swarm all over you weighs you down.</p>
