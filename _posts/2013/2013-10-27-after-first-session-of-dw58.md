After first session of DW:<br />what would giant interplanar necroscolopendra do? - I have to write it up<br />what will happen with interplanar scolopendra&#39;s eggs stolen by player&#39;s characters (treasure is treasure, anyway)?<br /><br />The players chose thief and wizard classes - I have to translate them then.

        <p>They sound like massive venemous centipedes that have the power to exist and hunt in several universes simultaneously. As a survival mechanism, they keep their organs in a separate universe which vibrates at almost the same frequency; so close that they can access their organs&#39; fluids and vital functions, or at least an echo of them. As they&#39;re <i>necro</i> scolopendra, their venom drains the victim&#39;s energy across the barriers between universes, turning them into husks as the necroscolopendra engorge themselves on the transfer.<br /><br />Their eggs are, of course, fabulously sought after and highly dangerous. If extracted right, the thief will be able to obtain a few doses of the Necroscolopendra&#39;s venom. If extracted wrongly, he&#39;ll hatch a creature that incubates in the void between the galaxies...</p>
