Played my first session in DW tonight on <span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink" href="https://plus.google.com/118384864526069238015" oid="118384864526069238015">Roll20</a></span> .. Man what a fun game. I&#39;m definitely making this system one of my regulars \m/

        <p>Right on <span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink" href="https://plus.google.com/104591880381730141397" oid="104591880381730141397">Tommy Rayburn</a></span> . I immediately liked the whole CharGen steps didn&#39;t take forever as it does sometimes with other systems, and I like the fact that some of your rolls for certain things, gives you a couple of options as where to go or what to do and this makes it so cool as the fiction can change in a heartbeat and go another direction from what you were expecting. This is a good system. \m/</p>

        <p>Well, if you get bored of Fantasy games .... their is so many other games and hacks using the World system.</p>

        <p>Cool. I&#39;m a fantasy guy anyway so I look forward to more of playing through this system</p>
