So thinking about fixed damage. Playing world of dungeons last night with its 12+ extra success result and loving the I/M/S damage system of burning wheel, I came up with this for my upcoming houserule-heavy conanesque campaign.<br /><br />Damage is a fixed value. Every class has a damage value equal to half the maximum result of its normal damage die (d4 = 2, d6 = 3 and so on). The weapon&#39;s bonus damage and general fixed bonus damage apply as normal. Bonus damage from spells, moves and other buffs expressed in dice works like class damage (half the max result).<br /><br />Hack &#39;n&#39; Slash<br />On a 7+, you deal your damage.<br />12+: you deal one and a half your damage, rounded down.<br />10-11: you can choose to deal one and a half damage, rounded down, but expose yourself to the enemy&#39;s attack.<br />7-9: choose one: you deal half your damage, rounded up; or you expose yourself to the enemy&#39;s attack.<br /><br />When halving or multiplying damage, start from the normal class damage plus any bonus damage as base, then calculate the actual damage. Every other move will be modified accordingly to match this system. Probably nerfing HP for both characters and monsters to balance things out and actually having a deadlier atmosphere.<br /><br />Another example:<br /><br />Magic Missile&#39;s damage is 5.<br />On a 12+ on spellcasting, the spell&#39;s effect is enhanced (so 7 damage for a MM).<br />On a 10-11 you can choose to enhance the spell&#39;s effect, but you have to choose one of the three standard options for a roll of 7-9.<br />On a 7-9, you have an extra option: the spell&#39;s effect is reduced (so 3 damage for a MM).<br /><br />What do you think?
