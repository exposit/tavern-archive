 <a rel="nofollow" class="ot-hashtag" href="https://plus.google.com/s/%23DruidWeek/posts">#DruidWeek</a> <br /><br /><b>The Learned Oak</b><br /><br />The Oak sits deep in the forest, it&#39;s branches stooped with age, it&#39;s roots deep into Mother Earth. No gust can knock it over, no axe can sully it&#39;s bark, but for a few who follow the old ways and treat the tree with honor it will share it&#39;s knowledge.<br /><br /><br />Any Druid, with appropriate moves like Thing Talker, can commune with the oak to auto-succeed on any Spout Lore related to the lands in which the Oak resides but the answers will take hours, sometimes days.<br /><br />It&#39;s knowledge is somewhat limited. It may know that a large battle was fought in a grove 20 years ago: &quot;Much blood was spilled to the south, where the pines begin to grow.....This was many many seasons ago.&quot; but it wouldn&#39;t know what banners were flown or what languages were spoken because it doesn&#39;t understand or care about the short lives of men.
