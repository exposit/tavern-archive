Decided to write up a fun new compendium class after work, based on that earlier thread on thieves. The PDF is available here: <a href="http://corvidsun.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/pathofghosts-050613.pdf" class="ot-anchor">http://corvidsun.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/pathofghosts-050613.pdf</a>

        <p>I thought Vishakanya was cool, but then I read The Well of Spirits.<br /><br />It&#39;s like each move is cooler than the last. (Except The Lonely Stair. It&#39;s okay I guess.)</p>

        <p>I was thinking Lonely Stair would have been really helpful when we tried to climb down the Bloodstone Idol.</p>

        <p>I&#39;m sure I know several players who would agree! Mostly it just seems like way too much work as a GM for what seems like it should be a simple process. Now I&#39;ve got to map the outer wall of the wizard&#39;s tower and more six different holds, seams and ledges just to find out if they get in?<br /><br />On the flip side, it&#39;s probably super awesome if you want detailed infiltration procedures in your game. Which, I guess is what this class is about!</p>

        <p>&quot;I want to ascend to the rank of Heirophant. Draw me a map of my route, GM.&quot;</p>

        <p>Also I&#39;m really digging the potential of Ghost Step for non-hack-and-slash moves. Parley with discreet gestures and body language! Stealthily scout a situation with Discern Realities! Undertake a perilous journey and take out the hireling who snubbed you by &quot;accidentally&quot; leaving him behind!</p>

        <p>I was definitely thinking about Prince of Persia: Sands of Time and those sorts of games when I wrote Lonely Stair. After you collaborate with the GM to identify your route, I&#39;m imagining you might work your way up somewhere and then Defy Danger with DEX to leap from a crack in the wall you&#39;re scaling to the hand of a giant statue or something. I&#39;m expecting the climb itself to be interesting and exciting.<br /><br />Now I&#39;m wishing it was slightly more general so you could use it to navigate social situations as well, by identifying rifts between different factions (seams) and who the critical people are (anchors)!</p>

        <p>Yeah, and the map could be like an org chart of the factions and interests in the room.</p>

        <p>Yeah, so a Deacon and her associates get invited to the Queen&#39;s birthday soir√©e. The Deacon cases the social dynamics with Lonely Stair, and then Parleys with Ghost Step to take out or intimidate a few folks (blackmail? bodily removing them without anybody seeing?). Could be pretty cool.</p>
