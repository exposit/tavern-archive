I&#39;m working on a new class playbook which uses these, but in the meantime I am sufficiently happy with these moves and they work well enough as standalones that I figured I&#39;d post them:<br /><br /><b>Contract Killer</b><br />When you <b>have downtime and put out word that you’re looking to take on a contract</b>, roll +Int. <b>On a hit</b>, someone approaches you with a job - they’ll give you a name and maybe a description. Roll 2d6: that’s what the job is worth to them, in tens of coins; take it or leave it. <b>On a 7-9</b>, the job has strings attached - they want you to kill the target in a specific way or place, by a specific time, etc. <b>If you fail to complete a contract</b>, take -1 ongoing to Contract Killer until you prove your worth again.<br /><br /><b>Ill Repute</b><br />When you <b>put out word that you’re looking to take on a contract and get offered a job</b>, their offer is double your roll.<br /><br /><b>The Professional</b><br /><i>Replaces: Ill Repute</i><br />When you <b>put out word that you’re looking to take on a contract and get offered a job</b>, name your price. If they can afford it, they’ll pay.

        <p>While this is a little outside my preferred scope of light-hearted adventuring, it&#39;s f***ing fantastic!</p>

        <p>Thanks! A friend has been pestering me to write up a class that steals from Dishonored for a while, so instead I am writing up a class that steals from Dishonored, the Malazan Book of the Fallen and the AD&amp;D Assassin class. Still not sure about the magical bits of it I&#39;ve got written up, but the assassin-y bits are shaping up pretty well.</p>

        <p><b>Well prepared</b><br />When you <i>Discern Realities</i> about your victim, you may ask &quot;When will be the most opportune moment to strike?&quot; instead of a question on the list.</p>

        <p>I did this, along similar lines as your move:<br /><br /><b>Stakeout</b><br />When you <b>spend several hours scoping out a place, person or situation</b>, you may Discern Realities with +Int and add the following questions to your list of choices:<br />- what is the stealthiest route out of here?<br />- what is the best way to get to my target?<br /><br />I might ditch the part about additional questions, though - I&#39;m wondering if &quot;What here is useful or valuable to me?&quot; and &quot;What should I be on the lookout for?&quot; aren&#39;t already enough to answer any kind of assassination-related questions. </p>

        <p>Actually, the more I think about it, the more I realise your &quot;What would be the most opportune moment to strike?&quot; question is way better than my two choices. Yoinked, if you don&#39;t mind.</p>

        <p>Mine is mostly about surviving the (post-apoc sci-fantasy) wilderness to get to the next city, as they&#39;re on a quest to cross a continent for some political allies. I&#39;m (very slowly) working on some stuff for a supplement on city-based campaigns, though, so this sort of fits into that.<br /><br />Mostly, I felt like making another playbook and there was a niche to fill.</p>
