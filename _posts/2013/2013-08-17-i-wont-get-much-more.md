I won&#39;t get much more done tonight (missed on my Nerd move and agreed to go out drinking instead) but I wanted to share what I&#39;ve got so far on my Ars Magica hack.<br /><br />The first question I struggled with was: What makes Ars Magica, Ars Magica? While there are many things about the system itself that I love, my goal here is to capture the essence, not the mechanics. With that in mind, I came up with this list:<br /><br />Wizards<br />The Gift (Twilight, Longevity Ritual)<br />The Order of Hermes (and the Houses)<br />Covenants (Companions, Grogs)<br />Magic (Spontaneous Casting in any combination of technique + form; Formulaic Magic that is less flexible but more consistent)<br />Laboratory (Rituals, Magic Item creation, Research)<br />Politics (Order, Covenant, Feudal, Church)<br /><br />My instinct is that each house should have its own playbook.<br />The game will centre around the Covenant, so each character will bring something to the Covenant as part of character creation.<br />Most mechanics will be defined at the wizard level, but I plan to make sure companions are still relevant.<br /><br />While there is a lot I like about DW, as <span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink" href="https://plus.google.com/110330901807759406775" oid="110330901807759406775">Tim Franzke</a></span>  pointed out, AW may prove to be even more central to the hack.<br /><br />Many lab rules can be cribbed from the Savvyhead.<br />Grogs can be defined using a combination of rules from the Chopper, Hardholder and Hocus.<br /><br />There&#39;s obviously a ton of work yet to be done, but I&#39;m feeling pretty positive about these first steps.<br /><br />Let me know what you think!

        <p>How do you feel about troop play, multiple characters per player, and seasonal play? Would they be part of the hack?</p>

        <p>The plan is to build in companions with the Mage character creation. Each player creates their own companion but they have to give it to someone else to play.<br /><br />Grogs will be handled like gangs in AW.</p>

        <p>If only my lazy players would step up ;) <span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink" href="https://plus.google.com/110330901807759406775" oid="110330901807759406775">Tim Franzke</a></span>.<br /><br />I hope to have the system fully support troupe style, including a rotating MC.</p>

        <p>A companion is a non-wizard pc with significant bonds to a wizard.<br /><br />I found the defining characteristics of a wizard were less his house, but  rather his virtues and flaws, though the two are related.</p>

        <p>Houses = playbooks seems to be the way that makes the most sense.<br /><br />Just FYI, the AW hacking community is here and might have more/better responses for you: <a href="https://plus.google.com/u/0/communities/107071334810365821574" class="ot-anchor">https://plus.google.com/u/0/communities/107071334810365821574</a></p>

While I plan to emulate DW&#39;s clarity and style, the original AW rules seem to be more easily adaptable to what I&#39;m trying to create. Hope to see you there :)<br /><br /><a href="https://plus.google.com/u/0/communities/107071334810365821574" class="ot-anchor">https://plus.google.com/u/0/communities/107071334810365821574</a></p>
