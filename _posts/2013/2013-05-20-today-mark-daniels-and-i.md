Today, Mark Daniels and I are releasing our <b>Take on the Lower Depths</b>, a supplement that explores some of the untouched lower depths of Dungeon World.<br /><br />Unlike previous endeavors, where I dutifully combed the dark recesses of the public domain artwork, Mark illustrated some truly spectacular creatures.<br /><br />This project began as my attempt to convert Wolfgang Bauer&#39;s Dungeon Magazine adventure &quot;Kingdom of Ghouls.&quot; It quickly became obvious, based on that adventure, that I&#39;d need to create a whole lot more. It has moved beyond that point, but its roots are still firmly entrenched in the bones of that spectacular adventure.<br /><br />Special thanks to +Josh Mannon , +Adam Koebel, and +Colter Hanna for you assistance. I will be petitioning the Dungeon World Steering Committee to add <i>face</i> as a range tag.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.rpgnow.com/product/114740/Take-on-the-Lower-Depths?affiliate_id=318171" class="ot-anchor">http://www.rpgnow.com/product/114740/Take-on-the-Lower-Depths?affiliate_id=318171</a>

        <p>Me too - a lot of good stuff in there (I&#39;m a little sad the pictures aren&#39;t CC BY, but at least the text is!)</p>
