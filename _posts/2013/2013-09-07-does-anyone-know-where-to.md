Does anyone know where to get a blank Dungeon World character play book? I want to write down the Mesmer playbook I&#39;ve been working on to one.  Also, what&#39;s the font for the playbook and where do I get that too?

        <p>Here&#39;s a couple in OpenOffice and Word 2007, respectively. <a href="http://apocalypse-world.com/forums/index.php?topic=6532.0" class="ot-anchor">http://apocalypse-world.com/forums/index.php?topic=6532.0</a> and <a href="http://apocalypse-world.com/forums/index.php?topic=6529.0" class="ot-anchor">http://apocalypse-world.com/forums/index.php?topic=6529.0</a><br /><br />I believe the fonts are Newcomen and Archemy, see page 363 of the book.</p>
