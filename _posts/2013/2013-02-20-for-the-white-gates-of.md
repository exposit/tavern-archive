For the White Gates of Madness, I bring you the Pillars of Madness! Boy, does that sound redundant when I write it out like that.<br /><br />This document is really, really long. It got kind of out of hand, but I&#39;m proud, like the demon-priest who gives birth to the monstrosity that will end the world.<br /><br />TL;DR version: Beyond the White Gates lies the Pyramidal Manse of the Insatiable Aesthetician. It is a prison. The Manse sits atop the Five Pillars of Madness. Each Pillar may actually be holding up the whole of the Madlands, not just the Manse. Each Pillar expresses its own form of madness. If you can get close to the Pillar and survive, you&#39;ll come away changed, forever.<br /><br />I&#39;d love to hear any comments for improvement, especially for the compendium class contained within (towards the end).<br /><br />In the long run, I&#39;m going to keep working on it, and add in stuff about the Pyramidal Manse, the Insatiable Aesthetician, and its Students. The lengthy shall become even lengthier.<br /><br />Madness, indeed.<br /><br />Thanks, everyone!<br /><br /><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1b1TObEfdCpGI81RpXgaExaGPXewQF_r7ZU0asKbtJx8/edit?usp=sharing" class="ot-anchor">https://docs.google.com/document/d/1b1TObEfdCpGI81RpXgaExaGPXewQF_r7ZU0asKbtJx8/edit?usp=sharing</a>
