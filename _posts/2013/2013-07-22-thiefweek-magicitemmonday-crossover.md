She payed 5 astromagicians their weight in gold and diamonds to create this cloak for her. While she was wearing this deep blue cape and hood with the embedded silver stars she could hear every whisper as loud as if it was spoken with clear voice. When she was alone with someone she could even hear what the people thought. <br />Of course it drove her insane after years of use.
