<a rel="nofollow" class="ot-hashtag" href="https://plus.google.com/s/%23MagicItemMonday/posts">#MagicItemMonday</a><br /><br />Sir Stephen&#39;s Shield<br /><br />The enchantments of the Witches of the Icy North have long been known to come with a price, but that did not stop Sir Stephen of Blackstone. He traveled north in secret to conceal his blasphemy from his fellow knights. Trading a large bag of gold to them, the witches did indeed enchant his shield, but they warned him that there would yet be another price to pay.<br /><br />It was shortly after Sir Stephen returned home that a dragon besieged Blackstone Keep. As the right rode out to meet the monster, he raised his enchanted shield, and the dragonfire did not burn him, but instead deflected as light from a mirror. Though the knights of Blackstone won they day, the witches&#39; prophecy came true, for the fire deflected by Sir Stephen&#39;s shield set ablaze the home of his family, killing all within. Disgraced and overcome with grief, Sir Stephen threw the shield off of a cliff and left Blackstone forever. he sought revenge against the witches, but could never find them, and he perished among the tundra.<br /><br />This steel knight&#39;s shield has seen a few battles, but it is still quite sturdy. The crest upon it has been scratched almost beyond recognition, though the rune of the Ice Witches are still easily readable on the inner rim. When you raise this shield against an incoming magical attack, roll+CHA. *On a 10+ you wrest control of the spell and may turn it back against the caster. *On a 7-9 the spell is deflected, but it goes haywire and may cause some collateral damage. The price upon the shield is still in effect, and anyone who uses the shield is one day destined to destroy someone or some thing that he loves dearly.
