Anyone have any monster stat blocks for evil cultists? What sort of moves would a dark priest of a serpent god have?

        <p>Let say...<br />10HP Armor 2 (they have scale robes) damage: 1d6<br />Moves:<br />Spit venom (a gift from the divinity) to blind adversaries<br />Summon vipers (a lot)<br />Strike of the Cobra (a kung fu like move) that paralyse a limb<br /><br /><br />And don&#39;t forget the forked tongue, those strange pupils and lispy words.</p>

        <p>2 armor seems pretty high. Is he wearing actual heavy armor?<br /><br />I&#39;d consider some more metaphorical/metaphysical move, such as &quot;Enthrall someone with a silver tongue&quot;</p>

        <p>Yes, the famous &quot;Kaa&#39;s hypnotic whisper&quot;<br />2 armor because it&#39;s like a scale mail.</p>

        <p>Back during the beta (so the stat blocks might not be compatible) when I did serpent cultists I made them entirely non-magical humans but gave them moves that evoked a snake-y theme like &quot;conceal self to strike later&quot; and &quot;circle slowly, observing&quot;. They all wore deep hoods and had a two-dagger blade-down swaying-motion fighting style so when they&#39;d bring their hands up near their faces in their &quot;ready stance&quot; it would evoke a snake-with-fangs feeling. I gave the leader a bottle of paralyzing poison, and they all tended to shout a lot about how what they were doing was bringing glory to their god, or how killing the PC they were attacking would serve as a sacrifice to their god, etc. I was pretty happy with how it worked out.</p>
