I&#39;m looking to do this as a series pitch for Dungeon World:<br /><br />&quot;You&#39;re all crew on the Galley <i>Serenity</i>, plying the wine dark seas of the Aegean, 8 years after Paris raped Helen and took her to Ilium, and Agamemnon and Menelaus gathered a fleet.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;You&#39;ve moved cargo, couriers and things best left unsaid in the mean time.  You&#39;ve got reasons to dislike both the Achaeans and the Trojans, and all this mucking about in the affairs of the Divine has made the world a much stranger place.&quot;<br /><br />I&#39;d like to run this in Dungeon World, with some of the classes reskinned - Paladin with slightly looser morals makes a nice proxy for &quot;There was a God in your family tree a few generations back.&quot;<br /><br />I&#39;d like to have magic, but not &quot;spellcasters.&quot; and enough variety in the &quot;non-magic&quot; types that it&#39;s not &quot;All Fighters, All The Time.&quot;<br /><br />Any suggestions for playbooks that would be appropriate?<br /><br />(One of the PC niches is the Captain of the <i>Serenity</i>, who&#39;d have a Doom sworn against him - if he passes through the pillars of Pylos, all he loves will be lost.  He&#39;s been avoiding any cargoes or jobs heading back that way ever since.)

        <p>Calling it serenity is casting weird perceptual shadows. <br />as for classes it really depends on how wonderful(lit) you want the setting to be<br />IW&#39;s Sky Dancer works for divine heritage<br />IW&#39;s captain obviously<br />IW&#39;s Survivor, the priest and  the templar <br />and I assume you&#39;ve considered the base classes</p>

        <p>Agreed, if you called it something else, you&#39;d have an epic, but calling it <b>Serenity</b> just invites comparisons. </p>

        <p>Argh, it’s about 150 pages… maybe if you look at something interesting we can translate it for you. By now I think you should use Google Translate.</p>

        <p>My reason for calling it the <i>Serenity</i> is that I&#39;m aiming for the earthier, grittier stories that happen &quot;behind&quot; the Trojan War, and so that players whose memories of the Trojan War are &quot;Oh, right, that chunk of the Illiad I had to read during AP English...&quot; don&#39;t immediately go &quot;OK, so there&#39;s fighters. And nothing else...&quot;<br /><br />These may not be especially <i>sound</i> reasons, but it&#39;s (in part) a chance to give players a quick hook to work from rather than &quot;OK, you need to be a classics dork to play this one.&quot;</p>

        <p>IW is Inverse World.  Launched as a KS but I think alot of the playbooks have been released.</p>

        <p>I&#39;ve worked out a timeline of the major Greek myth cycles as background for my game.  I&#39;m just trying to get playbooks assembled.<br /><br />To wit:<br /><br />The Theban Cycle (Oedipus to Seven Against Thebes and Antigone) was in your father&#39;s time.<br /><br />The Labors of Hercules was in your grandfather&#39;s time, including his eventual exile into Thrace and Illyria.<br /><br />Theseus&#39; voyage was about 30 years ago - he was the King of Athens.<br /><br />Jason and the Argo were scouting the route through the islands of the southern Aegean to find the route to Illium.  Medea is still happily married to him...</p>

        <p>Grim World&#39;s Skirmisher playbook would be soooo perfect for this.<br /><br />Oh, and I guess to a certain extent you could use the Fortune-Teller (seer) and Gladiator playbooks. I figure the Druid could be flavored into a Dryad really easily, too.</p>

        <p>Yeah, a friend pointed me at the Skirmisher playbook.  I&#39;ve not seen the Fortune-Teller and Gladiator - are they also in Grim World?<br /><br />Right now, here&#39;s my thinking on Playbooks:<br /><br />Barbarans = Sons of Hercules/Northerners<br />Fighter <br />Skirmisher<br />Paladin = Demigod/Divine Warrior<br />Druid = Dryad<br />Ranger<br /><br />I&#39;m looking for a good Seer/Fortune Teller class - anyone got a link to one?<br /><br />I&#39;d also be interested in a &quot;Noble&quot; class - someone who knows how to work the levers of the higher echelons of society, or a Hataera for the Inara role.<br /><br />Anyone got good nautical themed compendium classes to recommend?</p>

        <p>Don&#39;t forget Ken, that the AW playbooks are directly modelled on the Firefly character archetypes....<br />So maybe looking back to the core AW playbooks for inspiration? You&#39;d have to do some inter-system hacking though.<br />I love the idea of a &#39;classical&#39; iteration of DW. I&#39;d second Agon, its awesome sauce.</p>

        <p>I think the Brute would be better suited for a Hercules style character; it&#39;s all about sheer strength (throwing enemies around, bashing stuff!) rather than the outsider focus of the Barbarian. <br /><br />If you&#39;re looking for simple ship and crew rules, they&#39;re also included with the Brute (and 8 other playbooks) in Pirate World, my kickstarter that&#39;s going on right now!</p>
