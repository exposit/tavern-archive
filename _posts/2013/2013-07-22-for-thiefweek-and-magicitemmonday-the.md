For  <a rel="nofollow" class="ot-hashtag" href="https://plus.google.com/s/%23ThiefWeek/posts">#ThiefWeek</a>  and  <a rel="nofollow" class="ot-hashtag" href="https://plus.google.com/s/%23magicitemmonday/posts">#magicitemmonday</a>   <br /><b>The Nominate Repeater</b><br /><br />Said to be the favoured weapons of the Crimson highwaymen, although where they acquired them is unknown. The weapon requires neither powder nor shot; but in place of a flintlock apparatus is space to slot a single coin (of most denominations.) <br /><br />The pistol will not fire unless a &#39;donation&#39; has been made recently. It&#39;s been observed that coins of lower value will provide no more than half a dozen shots; when a jade doubloon (a high value coin from the Xi empire) was donated, the gun continued to fire for over 5 months.
