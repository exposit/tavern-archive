I&#39;m planning on including this page to give GMs an idea on locations in my next adventure supplement. Since Dungeon World is all about playing to find out what happens, and one of the main principles is to draw maps but leave blanks, I don&#39;t want to go into reams of detail here.<br /><br />Do you think these factoids and titbits would be enough to go on? Or too much/too little? All feedback welcome. (Appropriate creatures will be included as well. The quote in grey is one of several I&#39;ve scattered throughout, for fluff and as something to give the players for a successful spout lore/carouse etc.)

        <p>That looks great! Seems like the goldilocks zone of detail; just enough to provide a bit of a setting, but not enough to stifle creation. I really like &quot;traitorous travellers&quot; and &quot;a stuffed orc head on the wall&quot;</p>

        <p>this looks good. Just enough to get you thinking as a GM and can be turned into a multitude of things. </p>

        <p>I like! I esp. like the quote. How about a table of those types of quotes?</p>

        <p>That is the same way I structure all my games, but yours are nice and organized.  Mine are scribblings on scraps of paper, folded journals, and whatever else I can write a quick note on.  Last game notes:  Phoenix Feathers in her hair, where monsters fear to tread, Rich in blubber and Dusk.  </p>

        <p>Thanks for the kind words, everyone! Glad you enjoyed reading. (I&#39;ve also been reminded of <span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink" href="https://plus.google.com/111694100408744715863" oid="111694100408744715863">Jonathan Walton</a></span> &#39;s <i>Dungeons as Monsters</i> mechanic from Dark Heart of the Dreamer - check that out if you&#39;re looking for a method to turn your adjectives into specific moves for an adventure.)<br /><br /><span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink" href="https://plus.google.com/111228672220439598301" oid="111228672220439598301">Chad Bale</a></span> - I know - to be honest I should spend less time making my notes pretty and more time writing them! This is for my next adventure pack though and I wanted to be sure it looked the part.</p>
