Has anyone played in a high-level (10 or higher) game? How does the game change when the PCs are much more competent in their fields?

        <p>Well, 10 is as high as it goes. Wrapping around to a new class, taking an apprentice, or retiring are all different things, and none of them are quite like becoming more powerful.<br /><br />Looking at level 10 itself: the characters are definitely more competent, but not hugely so. Really, they&#39;re more diverse, and they have mechanical guarantees of more things. They build up options more than they build up power.</p>

        <p>Well, my concern about taking on a new class at 10 is that the character will still have ten levels worth of stat bonuses. If they continue to accrue more level ups, they will eventually top out a second or third stat. How does this change things?</p>

        <p>I don&#39;t allow stat increases from a second time through the levels.</p>

        <p>That works too. How much XP/level do you need at that point? Does the effective level reset back to 1?</p>

        <p>I reset effective level to 1 and am pretty tough on what moves from their previous class they get to keep. It&#39;s like starting a new career: your old skills atrophy, your new ones take time. <br /><br />As an alternative: past 10th level they can no longer take levels from their current class, but can replace moves from their current class with moves from another class.</p>

        <p>I like that idea, getting new moves by exchanging old ones.</p>
