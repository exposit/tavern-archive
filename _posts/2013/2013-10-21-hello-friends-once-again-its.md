Hello friends, <br /><br />once again its time to step into the fray. To focus our minds and songs to just one topic! Here the words and spread them through the Dungeon World, &#39;cause  <a rel="nofollow" class="ot-hashtag" href="https://plus.google.com/s/%23BardWeek/posts">#BardWeek</a>  has arrived!<br />So put some new strings on your lute and oil your pipes!<br />Dust of the spellbooks in forgotten languages and lets all give praise to the almighty Bard! King of support, Queen of socializing and maybe greatest scholar in your campaign. <br />Lets all deepen our Bard Expertise, create some new songs and moves for them and discuss all the things that make the Bard just so unique and special. <br /><br />Let the neverending song begin! <br />[mic-drop]
