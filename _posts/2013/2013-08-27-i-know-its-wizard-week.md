I know it&#39;s Wizard Week, but I really have a question about a couple of Druid (and by extension the Custom Class &quot;The Namer&quot;). The Druid has &quot;Hunter&#39;s Brother&quot; and &quot;Stalker&#39;s Sister&quot; which allows the Druid to &quot;Choose one move from the Ranger class list&quot;...<br />The wording of this seems vague to me, compared to other Multiclass moves. It seems to me it could be interpreted one of two ways: First, it could mean you can only choose from the Ranger Starting Moves. Second, you could treat it as a normal multi-class move and allow them to select a Move as if they were one-level lower. The final, and more lenient, way would be to allow selection of ANY ranger move. The problem with the third way, to me, is that you could, as a 2nd Level Druid, select any of the 6-10 Level Ranger Moves. Is that Intentional?<br />Â I know <span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink" href="https://plus.google.com/117415966179711277938" oid="117415966179711277938">Sage LaTorra</a></span> and <span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink" href="https://plus.google.com/112484087750169360510" oid="112484087750169360510">Adam Koebel</a></span> have weighed in on free-form multi-classing before (as in being all for it), but I really wanted to get an understanding on the wording of this move in particular. Any insights from anyone (or the designers)?

        <p>You can choose a move from the Ranger move list (that&#39;s the front and back of the Ranger sheet). You still have to meet requirements to take the move (for example, some moves <i>Require</i> others but some <i>Replace</i> others). By extension, you also have to be the right level to access certain moves.<br /><br />Multiclass moves, from my quick scan of them, never tell you to act like you&#39;re 1 level lower <b>except</b> when borrowing the cast a spell move -- and that is its own particular multiclass move different from Multiclass Dabbler, and the sibling moves the Druid has.<br /><br />All of this tells me the answer is: any Ranger move which you are a high enough level to otherwise qualify for.</p>

So if you are a 2nd Level Bard and take Multiclass Dabbler, you can take anything from the Starting Moves of any class (since you are to be treated as 1 level lower when choosing the Move, as is in the wording of Multiclass Dabbler). If you waited until 3rd Level then you could take any Starting or 2-5 Move from another class because you would then be a 2nd Level character.<br />The Druid move intentionally (?) is missing the level requirement. So, you can&#39;t take any of the &quot;Replaces&quot; or &quot;Requires&quot; but has no mention to what level you need to be to take the move. At best, I could see allowing you to choose from the Moves of the Ranger as if you were a Ranger of the same level (which is pretty much what you said, but I&#39;m just trying to think through this here. :D )</p>

        <p>Oh wowzers I stared at those multiclass moves for a minute and completely didn&#39;t read the second sentence. My bad.</p>

        <p>The Druid intentionally skips the &quot;one lower&quot; thing. So you choose any Ranger move (including God Amongst the Wastes) as if you were a Ranger of your actual level.</p>

        <p>Why would you need to take the move as if you were a level lower if the multiclass move <b>doesn&#39;t</b> tell you to do that? It&#39;s dead simple: pick one Ranger move that you meet the prerequisites for.</p>

        <p>You couldn&#39;t pick 6-10 Ranger moves unless you are level 6-10, due to the prescription that it be a move that you otherwise meet the prerequisites for.</p>
