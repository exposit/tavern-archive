Highlight from tonight&#39;s session: Wizard accidentally turning into a Gray Render in a library, attempts to hide himself with Invisibility and blinds himself instead. His cleric friend shows up to try and lead him out, but his massive size crushes the doorway, crippling the cleric. Cleric attempts to ride the Gray Render out of the library, directly into an evil cultist ritual.<br /><br />Fails are a beautiful thing.

        <p>He was simply trying to Spout Lore to decode a text. Turned out that text was a curse (only as a result of the fail.) The Gray Render was a die roll also, although I suppose a good one considering some of the horrible things he could have become.</p>
