Can a cleric cast <b>word of recall</b>, then learn some other spell and still have the recall work on the command word?<br /><br />How about casting a <b>true seeing</b>, and then replace that while its still ongoing?<br /><br />Or a wizard with invisibility?

        <p>When you commune you lose all yours spells before being granted new ones. So you&#39;d lose the word of recall spell when you tired to replace it. Same for True Seeing.</p>
