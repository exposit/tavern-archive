Inspired by some comments in the recent thread about paying for Dungeon World supplementary materials, I thought I&#39;d take people up on the advice offered: making available an earlier draft of a work for feedback.<br /><br />So, I have an Adventure Primer I&#39;ve been writing. It&#39;s a bunch of notes about a place, some NPCs, some monsters, a possible plot, and a Front. It is mostly done as far as I can tell -- but hey, I could be wrong! I&#39;d like to make it available to interested parties who:<br /><br />•Will take my Primer and run a game with it.<br />•Come back to me with their thoughts and feedback.<br />•Want to read some cool setting stuff about a dwarven city, a prison, a couple rituals, and an item or two.<br /><br />If you&#39;re interested, please let me know! I want to fine-tune this thing so I can really focus on polishing my presentation!

        <p>Hit me up! Can&#39;t promise I&#39;ll run it, sight unseen, but definitely up for the rest.</p>

        <p>Hey Alfred, I&#39;ll be glad to run it for strangers at my next go around.</p>
