Random thought.<br /><br />What if you only allow Debilities to heal during a Recover (and with special effecs like Healing potion and some rare moves) ?<br /><br />Debilities kinda suck but at least if they stick around for longer, it might worth it?<br /><br />It would work well with <span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink" href="https://plus.google.com/102595580176380683252" oid="102595580176380683252">Jeremy Strandberg</a></span> &#39;s variant of having only 3 debilities that affects 2 stats each.<br /><br />So far, I&#39;ve been &quot;giving&quot; debilities to players left and right but I allow them to heal &quot;when it makes sense&quot; which is usually whithin the same scene or right after, essentially making them kinda pointless (barely a nuisance).<br /><br />Alternatively, I had a player who roleplay especially well his debility, should I award him an XP? In my head it is REQUIRED to put your debility into play but most my players seems to either forget about it or &quot;forget about it&quot; until they&#39;re gone.<br />

        <p>I&#39;m not sure if I see the need for modifying the rule.  I think you can describe the fiction such that the debility requires longer to heal.  For example, in the We Hunt The Keepers podcast, at one point a player &quot;has his face melted&quot; by a very hot magic attack, and is given minus 1 to his CHA.  As far as I&#39;m concerned, that debility is only ever going to be removed by magic, or maybe a very capable surgeon in a  well-equipped facility that can only be found in a major city.  Or in the Discern Realities podcast during the Actual Play, a player his hamstrung, and given minus 1 DEX.  You don&#39;t recover from a sliced hamstring without months of time going by, or else magical healing-- there&#39;s no way it&#39;s going to heal at the end of the scene, or with a single night&#39;s rest.<br />Note that the rules as written say debilities are harder to heal than injuries and usually require a few nights rest in comfort, so if you&#39;re describing debilities that can be dealt with immediately (without magic), you&#39;re not GMing according to the rules (not that there&#39;s anything wrong with that, but it makes the case for modifying the rule less compelling).</p>

        <p>I&#39;ll recheck the wording in the book, it&#39;s very probable I don&#39;t exactly follow the concept as designed.<br /><br />But your right I&#39;m probably not using something punchy enough in the fiction. So far I&#39;ve been handling stuff like you&#39;re weak from a day&#39;s travel in the jungle and you&#39;re hallucinating from a plants spores and stuff like that, all of which are easily recovered from.</p>
