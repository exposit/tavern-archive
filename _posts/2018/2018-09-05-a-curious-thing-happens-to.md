A curious thing happens to the bodies of the slain in the Northlands. Putrefaction of corpses begins unusually fast, even in the cleanest of places. The flesh quickly turns black with necrosis; tissues becoming rigid in the joints and skin, yet fluid elsewhere in the body. Within a matter of just a few days, the diseased corpse becomes mobile. Within a week, it is a living skeleton sleeved in rot, the remaining organs reduced to septic sludge. <br /><br />Such creatures in this condition lack the shambling slowness of zombies. They prefer instead to leap or scuttle, unnaturally strong limbs seizing living prey to spread their plague. If it cannot find suitable prey, it will instead hide in whatever dark or moist place it can find and wait. They have no means of communication, but sometimes work together along with those it died alongside with.<br /><br />Because of this plague, prompt cremation of the dead is of the utmost importance in the Northlands. If a body cannot be burned, a liter of saline solution poured into the lungs via the mouth will /usually/ halt the transformation. Prayer seems to have little effect, as does consecrated burial; the dead just dig their way free.<br /><br />Oh, and don&#39;t try to raise the dead while you&#39;re in the Northlands. It ends badly for all involved.<br /><br /><br /><b>*The Decayed*</b><br /><br />Group, Terrifying<br />Filthy bite (d6 damage, close) <br />10HP, 0 armor<br /><br />Instinct: To spread the plague<br /><br />Moves:<br />Spread rotting infection<br />Grab them and never let go<br />Burst forth vile grave water<br />
