Just picked up the Dungeon World Rule Book a few days ago... and I am in love with it!<br /><br />Just wondering though, for the Infinity minis game we used 1&quot; round flat glass beads as tokens with images glued to the bottom of them.<br /><br />Anyone use something like these to pass on all the +1 forwards, or -2, etc?<br /><br />Think it might be cool to pass them out to help remind Players of all their mods and such.<br /><br />Is it worth it? And what kind of tokens would be useful to have on hand as a GM?

Just wondering though, for the Infinity minis game we used 1" round flat glass beads as tokens with images glued to the bottom of them.

Anyone use something like these to pass on all the +1 forwards, or -2, etc?

Think it might be cool to pass them out to help remind Players of all their mods and such.

Is it worth it? And what kind of tokens would be useful</a>

        <p>I&#39;ve used things like LITKO plastic cut tokens, but I think you have a great idea right there!</p>

        <p>For most of my token needs, I use Penny Gems (link below to existing stock, but they are no longer being made), tokens built by sticking these great rubbery circles onto US pennies. The best table feel ever. <br /><br />For Dungeon World, I don’t use them for +1 Forward, but rather for various kinds of hold. It’s easy to put a small stack of tokens on the move that generated them to remind <a href="http://you.store.impobj.com" class="ot-anchor">you.store.impobj.com</a> - PennyGems</p>

        <p>I used a rigid trading card protector with index cards inside. Bigger to handle and easier to read.</p>

        <p>oooooh, Infinity...<br />I too use beads of various type for holds, especially when the rules say hold 1 [something] as in most Awful Good supplements.<br />You may end up holding 3 Mist, 2 Faith, 3 Blood, 1 Fire, and so on.<br />Of course, the BASE rules don&#39;t distinguish between different holds.<br />For the +1, -1 ecc, there are lots of different solutions. Cards are better for conditions and relation with a mechanical effect, as in Masks. <br />You may use some Infinity MINIS, of course, just for fun and inspiration.</p>
