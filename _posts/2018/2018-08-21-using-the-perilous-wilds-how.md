Using The Perilous Wilds, how often do you make players make all the rolls?  As written, it seems like it would be once per day of travel, since you have to roll to make camp, and all of the scouting/navigating type rolls are supposed to be done to account for what happens on the way to the next camp.<br /><br />But that seems way too often to me.  14 rolls for a two week journey is likely to lead to multiple 6- results for each type of roll-- the campaign is going to become &quot;deal with the results of perilous journey rolls every session&quot;.<br /><br />Do you just go with what you think is best for the story, or are you a stickler for some method?  And if so, is that method really once per day, or is it less frequent than that?

        <p>Perilous Wilds is a procedure for wilderness adventures, so dealing with multiple 6- results while travelling through the unknown is kind of the whole point and if the PCs take on the role of Scout and Navigator according to their best stats it should be unlikely that both fail on their roll - allowing the one who (partially) succeeds to mitigate the fallout of the other&#39;s failure. Remember you can also make a soft move on a 6- like &quot;the weather worsens&quot; or &quot;use up their resources&quot;. <br />Obviously if you want the journey to be a part of the adventure but not the its main focus you can either shorten the distance, have them roll less frequently or just use &quot;undertake a perilous journey&quot; from DW.</p>

        <p>Yeah, and I tend to have them roll until the destination for UAPJ. So if they were going to have two encounters in two days, that one bad roll means that they&#39;ll be surprised by both or late for whatever else, or spend more or less rations for each of the days. I don&#39;t see a problem with doing that for all 14 days if it ever happens, but I&#39;d avoid that with setting some locations along the way and setting them as mini-destinations that PCs might not even know about, so the Goblin village two days travel, big rock shaped like a cucumber 4 days travel, etc. Or you can ask them &quot;What do you see after 2 days of travel through the jungle?&quot; and after making camp have them roll for next two days.</p>

        <p>You don&#39;t Make Camp everyday. Even if in the narrative the characters do, you don&#39;t trigger the move each day.<br /><br />As the GM, pick up the pacing that suits you best for the adventure. You could do a 2 weeks travel with no or a single roll of Undertake a Perilous Journey with no Make Camp move. Or you could do 3 UaPJ moves and only 1 Make Camp in the middle. It&#39;s really up to you.<br /><br />I usually only make them roll for a single UaPJ for the travel from the city to the place of adventure, whatever the distance between the two. When I feel the need, I can ask for a Make Camp also.<br /><br />To paint how dangerous is the travel, you don&#39;t actually need to roll mutiple times the UaPJ. Just make stronger moves. On a 9-, an easy journey will cost them a ration. On a hard journey, it might cost them all of their rations. An easy journey might bruise them, a hard one might break the leg of a PC, literally</p>

        <p>The Perilous Wilds rules-as-written very much emulate a &quot;hex crawl&quot; approach to exploration, where the exploration of (and dealing with) the wilderness <i>is</i> the adventure. So, basically, you end up rolling each move each day of travel. And I can definitely say: it&#39;s not right for every style of play. <br /><br />The DW-standard Undertake a Perilous Journey is very much an Indiana Jones style &quot;follow the red line&quot; style of exploration, where you largely skip over the travel and generally have one encounter on the way, with the &quot;scout&quot; roll determining your disposition for that encounter. (you can have more than one, sure, but the move sort of naturally leans towards one)<br /><br /><br />You can pretty easily shift the PW moves over to being a &quot;point crawl&quot; by freely interpreting the wording of it&#39;s Undertake a Perilous Journey move. &quot;...[A]sk the GM how far you should be able to get before Making Camp&quot; sort of implies &quot;how far can we get today.&quot;  <br /><br />But if you read that as &quot;how far should we be able get before you&#39;ll want us to do the Make Camp procedure,&quot; then that distance could be &quot;three days of travel, about halfway to town.&quot;<br /><br />Then, if the Navigator rolls a 7-9, and the GM chooses &quot;the going is slow or you wander off course,&quot; then you end up Making Camp more times on your way home, and potentially encountering more problems.  Or, the Scout roll might discern a beneficial terrain and the GM could decide &quot;sure, shortcut&quot; and they make it home without having to Make Camp at all.</p>

        <p>Thanks for all the guidance so far.  My workmates unexpectedly chose both a Ranger and a Druid in their four person party, so I want to honor that; but I have very little experience, either as a player or a GM, in outdoor-wandering-around type campaigns, in any system let alone DW.</p>

        <p>You&#39;ll be great don&#39;t worry! GMing in DW is more of a spotlight manager than anything else ðŸ˜Š</p>
