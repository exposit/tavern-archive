So, let´s say you somehow (custom move?) manage to give a monster a debility, how would you handle this rules-wise?

        <p>It&#39;d just be fictional positioning. Monsters don&#39;t have stats, so debilities don&#39;t reduce stats. They&#39;re just like new tags.</p>

        <p>&quot;Give a monster a debility&quot; would be a mechanical result that doesn&#39;t make sense, because the Monsters&#39; moves don&#39;t involve rolling dice.<br /><br />Look at The Ranger&#39;s &quot;Called Shot&quot; - they can either just deal damage, or risk the dice for the chance to also hobble, disarm, or daze the target.  This could be seen as inflicting something like a debility, but instead of proscribing a penalty to a die roll, you&#39;re outlining some change to the target. <br /><br />Called Shot gives you the option of debilitating the enemy, but it isn&#39;t using &quot;debility&quot; in the same way that the game uses the term for discussing mechanics.</p>

        <p>I&#39;d say to add to that custom move &#39;when you use monster debility against it take+1 to your next move&#39;.<br /><br />As others said before me. Most will be fictional positioning. If enemy is blinded he can&#39;t hit precisely, so maybe a successful defy danger can finish him off.</p>
