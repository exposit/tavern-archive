I recently took my stuff down from DTRPG. It&#39;s nothing serious, there&#39;s no scandal or anything. I just started a new job and I wanted to avoid anything that might suggest a conflict of interest. But since people enjoyed my material, here&#39;s all of it for everyone to have, for free, including the most recent version of my DW Unlimited Edition hack. Share it with your friends all you like, or hack it if you want. Just give me a shout out if you do. Enjoy.

        <p>Wow, I must say I’m positively humbled by the response. (Even if G+’s spam filters erroneously edited out some of it.) Thank you all very much!</p>
