Hey Tavern, I had moved to a new city a while ago and finally found a good FLG to try running face-to-face games again.  Since this is going to be a fresh start and I have no idea if I&#39;ll have regular players or just a bunch of drop-ins, I wanted to plan for something very loose and episodic that would look into the stories of whatever characters happen to show up--something like the <i>We Hunt the Keepers</i> campaign on the Gauntlet.<br /><br />Does anyone have any suggestions for this sort of game or running for random players at your FLG?

        <p>Go for a static setting that play can return to.  Whether it&#39;s the keep on the borderlands or a frontier town sprung up gold-rush style around a recently-discovered set of ruins, or a city with one great wall facing the haunted wasteland, or even within a great city of fantasy, set it up so the end of an adventure is a return to original state, so that the cast can change freely without it feeling weird.</p>

        <p>You might want to consider Love Letters for returning PC, or the move that I use :<br /><br />I’M BACK!<br />When you reunite with the group after being separated for an extended time, say what happened and roll …<br />■ … +STR if you fought a monster or escaped imprisonment.<br />■ … +DEX if you did something secret, stole something, or evaded something.<br />■ … +CON if you trained under a mentor or acquired help or resources.<br />■ … +INT if you learned ancient knowledge or invented something.<br />■ … +WIS if you discovered a secret or had a divine<br />encounter.<br />■ … +CHA if you made an ally, learned about a culture, or purchased something of interest or value.<br /><br />On a 10+, you had a prosperous leave; take +1 Forward and mark XP. <br />On a 7-9, you attracted trouble or your actions had unintended consequences, the GM will say what. <br />On a 6-, in addition to whatever the GM says, take -1<br />Forward.<br /></p>

        <p>I see to recall <span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink" href="https://plus.google.com/116013665970125878211" oid="116013665970125878211">Yochai Gal</a></span> and <span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink" href="https://plus.google.com/110301622772119888974" oid="110301622772119888974">Andrew Huffaker</a></span> both saying they did that sort of thing, they might have some advice. <br /><br />While I really like <span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink" href="https://plus.google.com/104915224203075819082" oid="104915224203075819082">Rob Donoghue</a></span>&#39;s ideas, one wrinkle is that a &quot;living&quot; world like he describes somewhat constrains the amount player-led worldbuilding you can do. And that&#39;s a pretty cool part of DW&#39;s play culture. <br /><br />Like, if you ask the first player to play an elf &quot;what are elves like?&quot; and she says &quot;super hippies, totally in tune with nature, can&#39;t bear the touch of iron or steel,&quot; then that becomes something you have to tell the player <i>next</i> week. And/or they come up with increasingly elaborate distinctions, like &quot;oh, the <i>southern</i> elves are all hippies, but I&#39;m an <i>eastern</i> elf and we&#39;re totally punk rock, oi oi!&quot;<br /><br />Personally, I&#39;d probably come with some light-weight, easy-to-finish-in-one-session scenarios. And if you get some regulars, then start putting letting your world build up around their input.</p>

        <p>I&#39;m with <span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink" href="https://plus.google.com/102595580176380683252" oid="102595580176380683252">Jeremy Strandberg</a></span> . come up with a loose scenario that can be played in many different ways. After asking all of the leading questions before play, use Jason Cordova&#39;s Eye of Gruumsh idea is what I go to.</p>

        <p>I&#39;ve been running one-shots for a local Meetup group (I had to start it, there was nothing even close to DW before) for a while now; so I know exactly how you feel. <br /><br />If you&#39;re planning for one shots, might I suggest a project I&#39;ve been working on? It&#39;s almost complete, I just have to flesh out the GM section. <br /><br />Essentially, it&#39;s a version of Dungeon World built specifically for one-shots or tiny campaigns (1-3 sessions <i>at most</i>). I&#39;ve completed the Playbooks (all one-page) and modified a number of rules to accommodate quicker games (for example, there are no rations, 3-18 ability scores, or leveling) . I&#39;d be happy to share it with you; I expect to have the rest finished in the next week or so anyways.</p>
