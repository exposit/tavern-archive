Hello Tavern! This is a class based on Shikamaru from Naruto.<br />I wrote this for a friend of mine, and I would like to share it with the community. You are allowed to change everything, and share it with your friends, I do not care. If someone finds any mistake, please let me know, as english is not my primary language. Any feedback is appreciated, and if someone changes the layout to make it look good, I would be happy to have a copy (I tried some templates, but could not make any of those work XD).<br />I am thinking of writing other classes always from Naruto, if this one works, so let me know what you think! :D<br />
