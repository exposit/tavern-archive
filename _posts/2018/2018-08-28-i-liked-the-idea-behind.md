I liked the idea behind Colin&#39;s <b>Insidious Hunger</b> move in the last Dungeon World Newsletter, but I didn&#39;t like the amount of rolling the players had to do while fighting the horde that attacked with this move, especially on a play by text platform like <a href="http://rolegate.com" class="ot-anchor">rolegate.com</a> where battles take long enough as it is. So I changed it a bit but it&#39;s still terribly costly and dangerous after a horde of fog creatures attacked the capital:<br /><br /><b>*Insidious Hunger*</b><br /><br />This enemy exudes an aura of gluttony and everhunger. Once it drains your HP to half or below, roll+CON: on a 10+, gain 1 craving. On 7-9, gain 2 cravings. On 6-, gain 3 cravings and a sick debility. Whenever a move would have you consume a ration, such as Make Camp or Undertake a Perilous Journey, consume an additional ration and reduce your craving by 1. You must consume at least 1 ration to reduce your craving. If you ever go a day without eating while you have any craving, lose all craving and gain an appetite for sentient flesh.<br /><br />I played it like this with my group, and I&#39;ll let you know how this appetite for sentient flesh translates in a slum on the borders of a city waiting to be attacked by a supernatural threat.
