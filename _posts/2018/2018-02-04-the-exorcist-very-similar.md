*THE EXORCIST *<br /><br />Very similar to the Shaman, and a bit of a Pokemon master, this CC adds a little challenge catching spirits, while trying to leave out the &#39;holy&#39; aspect of it. It does have allot of the word virtue, but with a STAT with the same name, its hard not to. I couldn&#39;t think of another name for the STAT.<br /><a rel="nofollow" class="ot-hashtag" href="https://plus.google.com/s/%23DungeonWorldCC/posts">#DungeonWorldCC</a><br /><br /><b><i>The Exorcist</i></b><br /><i>Your experience as a purger of spirits has given rise to certain skills, providing you with power over them.</i><br /><br /><b>Symbol of Virtue</b><br />You have a symbol that represents your strongest virtue. It&#39;s what gives you the power to command spirits. Describe your symbol and your Virtue, then choose a STAT that best suites that virtue, this is your max VIRTUE. The symbol has a weight of 1.<br /><br /><b>Spirit Imprisonment</b><br />When you attempt to imprison a spirit, whether roaming or of a dieing creature, within your Symbol of Virtue, describe how you do so and roll+VIRTUE.<br />10+ The Spirit is contained within your Symbol of Virtue, it gains 1 wt. The GM will give the spirit one move from its abilities when it was alive that it may perform when commanded.<br />7-9 The spirit is captured, but your VIRTUE is also reduced by 1.<br /><br /><b>Command Spirit</b><br />When you command a spirit, free or imprisoned, you must first roll+VIRTUE.<br />10+ The Spirit will perform a move within its abilities when it was alive.<br />7-9 It will perform the command, but first needs some compelling. Choose 1:<br />-&gt; Show the power of your virtue, reduce your VIRTUE by 1.<br />-‎&gt; You will free it from your imprisonment. <br />-‎&gt; Why does the spirit linger in this plane? Make a deal with the spirit and help it to the next.<br /><br /><b>My Virtues</b><br />When you rest for more than a few hours and have time to contemplate your role, increase your VIRTUE to max.
