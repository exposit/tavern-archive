Sadly I won&#39;t have much time for Dungeon World adventures this month, as personal and professional obligations have arisen meaning the forces of evil will have to wait their doom patiently in April. I can offer up something I did last month to celebrate J.E. Holmes&#39; birthday. I&#39;ve run various versions of his famous &quot;Tower of Zenopus&quot; before but this time I tried to convert it as closely as possible to Holmes&#39; classic dungeon. I offer this conversion &quot;Zenopus Classic&quot; to Dungeon World fans.<br /><br />Happy Delving!

        <p>Any other biology people read that as &quot;Tower of Xenopus&quot;?</p>

The use of the name was presumably an in-joke as Dr. Holmes was a neurophysiologist and Xenopus laevis is commonly used in biology research. Holmes later used evil frog-men in his novel Maze of Peril.</p>
