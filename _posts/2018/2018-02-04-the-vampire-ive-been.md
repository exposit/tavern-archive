*THE VAMPIRE *<br /><br />I&#39;ve been seeing allot of CC&#39; s lately and wanted to add my own take on a few. First up, the Vampire. I like to keep them simple and slim, almost suited for WoDu.  Thoughts? <br /><a rel="nofollow" class="ot-hashtag" href="https://plus.google.com/s/%23DungeonWorldCC/posts">#DungeonWorldCC</a><br /><br /><b><i>The Vampire</i></b><br /><br /><b>Blood Drinker</b><br />When you drink the blood of a living creature, hold 2 BLOOD (may not exceed 2). You deal additional damage equal to your BLOOD.<br />Spend BLOOD to do the following, 1 for 1.<br /><br />-&gt; The blood rushes through your veins and you can feel its life renew you. Heal for 1d4 hp.<br />-‎&gt; You satisfy a hunger, unmark a box under <b>The Hunger</b>.<br />-‎&gt; Peer into the victim&#39;s memories. Ask the GM a question the character would know, the GM will give you an honest answer.<br /><br /><b>Creature of the Night</b><br />As a creature of night, the sunlight causes you harm.  You must Defy Danger when ever you are exposed to the sun&#39;s rays.<br /><br /><b>On Blood, Sustained</b><br />You do not need to consume food.  When ever you would normally consume a ration, instead spend BLOOD. If you have none left, mark a box under <b>The Hunger</b>.<br /><br /><b>The Hunger</b><br />Cursed with the need for blood from the living, you have an insatiable hunger and overwhelming desire to feed on them. When hunger strikes, mark a box.<br /><br />[ ] The need for sustenance can be debilitating at times. Mark a debility.<br />[ ] Fragile and slow, you deal -1d4 damage.<br />[ ] You can&#39;t hardly hold yourself up. Your load becomes 2.<br /><br /><b>When you would mark a box, and all boxes are marked</b>, instead your hunger overwhelms you and you go on an all out feeding frenzy, killing everything alive and vulnerable. You wake up a few hours later, and so long as you fed on your kill during the frenzy, with 4 BLOOD held and all hungers satisfied.<br /><br />P.S.<br />Ideas came from the post below. A much more detailed CC.<br /><a href="https://plus.google.com/103013877571181739889/posts/BaEJsbp1v2L" class="ot-anchor">https://plus.google.com/103013877571181739889/posts/BaEJsbp1v2L</a>

        <p>Thanks for mentioning me! Like the other ccs you just posted, it looks simple and awesome! I just think rolling to drink blood in order to determine the number of hold.</p>

        <p>I dig it! Is there a maximum BLOOD the character can hold? If not that damage boost per BLOOD could get out of hand really quickly.</p>

I figure, youd have to roll Defy Danger anyway to get the chance against a target able to protect themselves. Sleeping however, drink away muhahha</p>

I wasn&#39;t thinking about stacking it.<br /><br />I added a clause into the edit.<br /><br />Thank you!</p>

        <p>This is good. I can see a mini arch about dealing with this.<br /><br />My only advice would be dropping the double negative in the third Hunger option.</p>
