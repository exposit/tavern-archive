        <p>I like the direction you’re going with this - channeling Diplomacy really implies focus on the fiction and relationships, not the rolls or mechanics. And this is the heart of DW. <br /><br />I, too, have been thinking about mass combat within DW. Looking for balance between simulation and narration, I was directed to the mass combat system in Legend of the 5 Rings. Highly recommend taking a look based on your comments about hero participation and battlefield events. There’s a whole bit about how to handle each of those and have them interact.</p>

        <p>I really really like this.<br />My current campaign is set after a Fantasy First World War and I&#39;ve been wanting to do a prequel campaign set right in the middle of the conflict. But I could never figure out how to have a  continent-scale catastrophe alongside small influential missions and this seems like a great start!</p>

        <p>I have done mass combat modelling each side with a &quot;usage die&quot; mechanic from TBH and similar.<br /><br />A small squad has size d4, a gang size d6, an army unit has d8, etc.<br /><br />When a battle happens, both side roll dice. On a 1-2 casualties are severe enough to drop the die size (d4 drops to nothing, squad gone). Otherwise, the highest number gains ground, has an advantage, or otherwise achieves some reasonable goal.<br /><br />Character actions can provide an advantage (roll two dice, take the highest) to their roll, or a disadvantage to the enemy&#39;s roll (two dice, take the worst). Characters that are part of a unit taking casualties need to Defy Danger or suffer damage or debility.<br /><br />This worked pretty well. I only used it in one session, but it was fun.<br /></p>

        <p>Look at hero&#39;s of battle from wotc for dnd<br />Also look at fields of blood from eden from eden press for dnd.<br /><br />Both have mechanics that could be  good idea sources</p>
