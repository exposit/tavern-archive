How would you handle the consequences of the following situation... <br />There are four zombies attacking my group&#39;s fighter. Three of the zombies are attempting to push him backward into a pit. I&#39;m using a tug-of-war progress clock for that one. The remaining zombie is just trying to deal its damage and eat his brains.<br /><br />Should I deal with the zombies as if they are two separate groups attacking the fighter? Or, one group and choose which to use for consequences on anything other than a 10+? If the advice is to treat them as two groups, is it as if I keep the spotlight on him for twice as long when it gets around to him? First make a move to avoid the pushers, and then if the fictional positioning still calls for it, separately ask him to do something to avoid the lone attacking zombie?<br /><br />Thanks in advance for your wisdom.

        <p>Perhaps the group of zombies needs a custom move:<br />Overwhelm Prey!<br /><br />You have a horde/group of zombies attacking The Fighter.  They are collectively trying to eat the PC while effectively driving them toward the pit.<br /><br />Does the PC lay into the group with attacks and trigger Hack &amp; Slash?  Does the PC try to hold their ground and trigger Defend?  Does the PC come up with another strategy entirely, perhaps triggering Defy Danger or some other move?<br /><br />I wouldn&#39;t get wrapped up in deciding that a group of zombies is working at different purposes, or micromanaging how many are doing what.<br /><br />If the zombies deal damage, they deal base damage die +1 for each additional zombie.  If instead they attack with their &quot;Overwhelm Prey!&quot; move, they drive the PC back or drag them to the ground.  <br /><br />I do like the use of a countdown clock for being driven back toward a specific threat; but if the player finds a good way to narrowly escape that fate, i would be prepared to keep up other threats until the zombies have been dealt with.</p>

        <p>Remember that the monsters don&#39;t take turns, so having &quot;two groups&quot; of zombies on the Fighter doesn&#39;t mean that they get two goes at him or anything... he just has to deal with both of them in his response to you asking him &quot;what do you do?&quot;<br /><br />How the Fighter responds to the situation would go a long way to determine how you run it.  If he says he&#39;s going to attack the brain-biter without even worrying about the ones dragging him towards the pit, then they&#39;ll probably drag him a fair way even on a successful Hack and Slash.  If he mainly tries to resist being dragged, then he&#39;s resisting the combined danger of being dragged and the one trying to nom his forehead, which will dictate the sorts of hard choices he might be given if he gets a 7-9 on Defy Danger.  If he comes up with some tricky plan like flipping one of the dragging zombies forward over his shoulder to knock away the brain-biter, then the outcomes on Defy Danger will be different again.<br /><br />All that said, if the Fighter is in this highly dangerous situation and no-one else in the party is in in such a sticky spot, it makes sense for the Fighter to be getting more spotlight than the rest.  But then again, if they&#39;re at liberty to act, the other party members should be jumping in to help their companion...</p>

        <p>You got a pretty complex situation there, especially considering the type of monster.<br /><br />Are these intelligent zombies? And if so, is the fourth not helping his comrades on purpose? If not...  <br />Why not having them all do what zombies do, namely bashing, scratching and biting?<br /><br />Anyway, my advice is to manage the zombies from the point of view of the PCs:<br /><br /><b><i>Fighter</i></b><i>, this zombie is lunging at you. What do you do?</i><br /><br />Establish Fighter&#39;s fictional positioning and move.<br />Then whatever Fighter rolled and before narrating your part of the move result...<br /><br /><b><i>Rest of the group</i></b><i>, while Fighter is doing this you notice that three more zombies are about to tackle him from behind! What do you do?</i><br /><br />Establish everybody else fictional positioning and triggered moves.<br />Roll and resolve any way you see fit.<br />Combine the results.<br /><br />This &quot;split&quot; approach achieves a number of things:<br />▶ It feels like everything happens simultaneously while you&#39;re still resolving things sequentially.<br />▶ Let&#39;s you move the spotlight around.<br />▶ Encourages the notion that the party should operate as a unit.<br />▶ You can still choose to use the extra zombies as part of a GM move in response to a 7-9 or 6- because you only mention them after the Fighter&#39;s roll.</p>

Both his cleric and wizard, separately and simultaneously just extricated themselves from their own messes. The group has had a long series of really bad rolls. The fighter had initially indicated he was only going to attack the 3 pushers, soI reminded him that to ignore the 4th would mean it just deals its damage and potentially its Zombie Rot. He decided to swing his messy, forceful two-handed sword in a broad arc through all 4 of them and did enough damage to rip them apart.</p>
