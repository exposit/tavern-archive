On a 10+ you take <del>1 forward to Last Breath. On a 7-9 you take -1 ongoing to Last Breath until you can break this curse. On a 6</del> you roll Last Breath immediately.<br />----------<br /><br /><b>Matt Colville on Metagaming</b>: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IyWfaMmhrM" class="ot-anchor">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IyWfaMmhrM</a>  <br />by Matthew Colville: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkVdb9Yr8fc05_VbAVfskCA" class="ot-anchor">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkVdb9Yr8fc05_VbAVfskCA</a><br />A 42 minute video where Matt Colville discusses metagaming.
