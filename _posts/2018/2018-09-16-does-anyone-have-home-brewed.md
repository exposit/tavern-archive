Does anyone have home brewed rules for getting critical roles or natural 12 on character moves?

        <p>I just had this happen last night, critical success on a defy danger whilst being swallowed by a giant snake lol.  We also had at least one critical success in hack and slash.  I don&#39;t want a huge impact from crits, this ain&#39;t D&amp;D, but I think at times when the fiction supports it, there should be some additional benefit. <br /></p>

        <p>it&#39;s rarer than a nat 20 so sure, why not something fun</p>

        <p>AW had an &quot;Advance a Move&quot; option, which gave Basic Moves a 12+ effect. I&#39;ve done it on the fly with my DW games. No reason not to codify it. <br /></p>

        <p>House rules, no. I have had players try something stupid/awesome where I was prepared to say &quot;hand me your character sheet&quot;, but then they roll a natural 12 and you just have to respect that.<br /><br />The situation I&#39;m thinking of was &quot;They&#39;re holed up in the security center ? Cool. We&#39;re going up one floor and cutting a circle in the floor to drop in on them unexpectedly.&quot; That&#39;s an unqualified bad idea, but if you roll a 12 doing it...</p>

        <p>You could take inspiration from the Thief&#39;s move<br /><b>Evasion</b><br /><i>When you defy danger</i> on a 12+, you transcend the danger. You not only do what you set out to, but the GM will offer you a better outcome, true beauty, or a moment of grace.<br /><br />And do something like<br /><br /><b>Critical Success</b><br /><i>When you roll for a move and get all sixes</i>, ask the GM for one of the following:<br />a. A show of true mastery<br />b. An unbelievable stroke of luck<br />c. Divine, or mundane, intervention<br /><br />Evasion is still relevant because the trigger of the latter is <i>all sixes</i> instead of 12+. AnyDice says that respective chances are:<br />12+ on 2d6+3: 27.78%<br />12 on 2d6: 2.78%<br /><br />Also notice that if you use one of the Advantage variants of Aid you would need to roll three sixes to get a critical (0.46%), which I find appropriate.<br /><br /><span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink" href="https://plus.google.com/118285647887876243328" oid="118285647887876243328">Michael Llaneza</a></span> if you allow for a move to trigger, the action will succeed on a 10+. Crits have nothing to do with it because as a DW GM you aren&#39;t allowed to set a Difficulty Rating off-screen.<br />If something has no chance of succeding, like wounding a magic dragon with a mundane weapon, you shouldn&#39;t allow the roll in the first place.</p>

        <p>Seems to me like the kind of thing that should be handled by instinct, rather than mechanics. <br /><br />If the situation is dramatically interesting, and a perfect roll occurs, roll with it.</p>

        <p>Our group will do some box cars or snake eye specials. It&#39;s up to the GM but they are usually just steroided hard moves.</p>

        <p>I like a simple XP on boxcars and a hardest move and extra XP on snake eyes.</p>

        <p>Hey thanks for all the great responses. I definitely never intended to bring crit rolls into the game, but the players demand it! I like the idea of handing out a surprisingly good success on 12 rolls, and maybe  xp. Also taking the rogue move and making it a move that players can select as a special move would be cool. I’ll have to experiment, and get back to you guys after my next session, if anyone rolls 12’s.</p>
