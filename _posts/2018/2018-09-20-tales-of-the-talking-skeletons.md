<b>Tales of the Talking Skeletons</b><br /><br />Do you like TALKING SKELETONS?<br />Do you like ADVENTURE?<br /><br />If you answered yes to at least one of the above, then my new Kickstarter is for you!<br /><br />Tales of the Talking Skeletons is an anthology of adventures for Dungeon World, each featuring at least one talkative skeleton. I&#39;ve reached out to get as many distinct perspectives as I can, plus me, so the resulting collection should have something for everyone!<br /><br />Provided the everyone in question likes talking skeletons.

        <p>I really like the Plague of Storms! Which has a talking Skeleton too. And we had fun with it :)<br />And i also like the &quot;Hardship&quot; Option you made. <br /><br /></p>

        <p>Cool! I like knowing that the stuff I create is out there helping people have fun. <br /><br />The hardship tiers I first saw on Storybrewers projects -- Alas For The Awful Sea, I think -- and thought it was a good idea so I added them as well.</p>
