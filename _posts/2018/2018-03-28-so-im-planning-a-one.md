So I&#39;m planning a one shot for a small local con of sorts in a few months. I&#39;ve settled on the players being an envoy of undead being sent into human lands from a faction of undead who&#39;ve regained their sentience after the BBEG Necromancer that raised them was defeated. Now the people of a ruined kingdom have taken up resistance in their old homes and want to re-establish ties to the other Human kingdoms they were allied with in life. (It&#39;s all very much like Warcraft Forsaken... In fact it&#39;s the direct inspiration)<br /><br />The party will be Bard, Cleric, Fighter, Ranger, Thief, Wizard.

        <p>Two thoughts:<br /><br />Cleric: I don&#39;t like restricting domains. I get the idea behind Healing and Restoration; and Civilization turning their backs. But at the same time, whose to say a god of Healing and Restoration wouldn&#39;t be impressed with the Undead&#39;s tenacity to restore itself to life after dying, or a god of Civilization appreciating the desire of the Undead wishing to create Civilization from the literal ashes of their former life? It&#39;s also the only playbook that loses something. <br /><br />Thief: I&#39;d just say make the crop that&#39;s growing up to the player, if they ask, but defaulting to Bloodweed seems fair.</p>
