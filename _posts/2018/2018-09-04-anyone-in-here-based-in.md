Anyone in here based in NYC and looking to play?  I&#39;ve got an RPG Meetup running Saturday mornings at 11:00 AM and this month we&#39;re playing Dungeon World!  We meet at Hex and Company to play, on the Upper West Side.  Love to see some of you there!

        <p>It might be hard for me to come from NJ regularly, but I might come to a special event if you have one.<br /></p>
