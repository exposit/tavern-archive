Does anyone know of any custom moves regarding charting/recording the map of a dungeon? Something like the navigator of the party documenting their crawl?<br /><br />Ie<br /><br />When you take a second with quill and parchment to record your journey, roll +wis: <br />

        <p>Does it need to be a move?  Isn&#39;t that filed under &quot;Draw maps, leave blanks&quot; for the players to fill in the blanks?</p>

        <p>Narratively, the players are commissioned to go into a dungeon and map it for someone, so I thought it would make them feel good to have a move to rely on. I guess the Cordova maze move could work, but I wasn&#39;t really leaning towards that one.</p>

        <p>If the party has been commissioned to do it then maybe the move can indicate how well they succeeded. Maybe keep a running score as to how well or poorly done the map is (but neither the characters nor commissioner will know how accurate it is until they attempt to use it). Or something LOL. I&#39;m jumping on a conference call in a couple minutes, but I&#39;ll  think about it.</p>

        <p>I think it could be a cool move that you pull in the middle of a dungeon. You ask who is keeping track of their progress/the way out. Then you have that PC roll. The move would be like:<br /><br />When you are miles deep in the dungeon, roll+INT. <br /><br />On a 12+ you can retrace your route in your head, even without a map, and get a sense of how the dungeon is laid out. You can ask the GM one question:<br />&gt; Where is the _ room located?<br />&gt; What is the purpose of this dungeon?<br />&gt; (Other questions I don&#39;t have time to think up right now)<br /><br />On a 10+ you can retrace your steps with the help of your notes.<br /><br />On a 7-9 you can retrace your steps with the help of your notes, but you missed some stuff and it will take time.<br /><br />On a 6- you realize you are lost. (The GM may actually change the dungeon layout behind you to reflect your erroneous memory.)<br /><br />Something like that.</p>

        <p>I like that 6- result. I don&#39;t know how many times I&#39;ve been in a game like skyrim and found out I was totally lost when I thought I knew where I or that certain doorway was.</p>

I like the -3 torch move..&#39;it&#39; starts hunting you. If I do a horror theme, I&#39;ll remember this move.</p>

        <p>This was mostly doodled while I was on my conference call. It uses 2 moves and names the hold (I like to do that if you&#39;re going to refer to the amount held with another move). It also takes your fiction into account (someone commissioned the party to map this particular dungeon). It&#39;s not great and can be improved quite a bit! I&#39;ll work on it more if I have a chance this evening.<br /><br /><b>Map the dungeon</b><br /><br />When you <b>have an opportunity to spend some time with quill and parchment to draw a map of the dungeon you&#39;re in</b>, roll + WIS. Add +1 if you have plenty of light.<br /><br />10+ You create an adequate rendering of the dungeon to this point. Hold 1 Accuracy.<br /><br />7-9 Choose 1:<br /> &gt; It&#39;s mostly accurate. Hold 1 Accuracy, but you were rushed because <i>something</i> is coming towards you (the GM will tell you what).<br /> &gt; You did a poor job. The scale is all wrong and you missed at least one room.<br /><br />6- Lose 2 Accuracy (Accuracy can be negative). The GM will tell you why!<br /><br /><b>Turn in the map</b><br /><br />When you <b>turn in the map you created</b>, roll + Accuracy<br /><br />(Neither the characters nor the person who commissioned the map will be aware how accurate it it until someone attempts to use it.)<br /><br />10+ You gain a good reputation with the person who commissioned the map. That person&#39;s plan will succeed (where the map is concerned).<br /><br />7-9 It&#39;s a map! It will be touch and go, but the commissioners plans will succeed (where the map is concerned). Don&#39;t expect a warm welcome the next time you&#39;re in town though!<br /><br />ROUGH first draft. Don&#39;t include the + 1 for &quot;plenty of light&quot; if you don&#39;t want to. (I totally read &quot;It&#39;s a map!&quot; in Admiral Ackbar&#39;s voice!)</p>

        <p>Torchbearer does this in an interesting way. Basically as you move through the dungeon you make a note of the rooms. And then at a certain point you roll your cartographer skill and if its successful the map is accurate if not then bad things can happen if you follow it.<br /><br />The thing is the person receiving the map is not going to know its accuracy until he is in the dungeon so I can see fun adventure where you have failed and the person has been missing for a bit tooo long and you have to search the dungeon for them.</p>
