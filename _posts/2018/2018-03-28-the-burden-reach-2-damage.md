<b>The Burden</b><br />Reach, +2 damage, two-handed, forceful, <br />weight 10<br /><br />This massively oversized Great Sword can only be wielded by the mightiest of Paladins who show dedication to their cause above and beyond the call.<br /><br />When carrying The Burden and using the Quest move a Paladin may pick one extra boon but must pick one extra vow if they do so.<br /><br />
