Working on converting  the classic DCC adventure &quot;The Jeweler that Dealt in Stardust&quot; by Harley Stroh to Dungeon World. Any Feedback?<br /><br />Do the unusual monster combat mechanics work?<br /><br />Revised: Spider of Ygiiz	           Group, Small, Devious, Planar<br />Grapple Attack	6 HP	1 armor<br />Close<br />Special Qualities: Grapple Attack<br />Among the first beings drawn through Ogo’s starry portal,the Spiders are not arachnids in the true sense. Spiders most resemble enormous six-legged ticks, the size of large hounds. The Spiders are perfectly black, so dark that they reflect no light whatsoever, appearing as only the absence of any color,as if reality itself had been cut away in the Spider’s form. The Spiders wait for the PCs to enter the darkened garden before attacking—springing through the air and bearing their victims to the ground. The touch of the Spiders is as cold as the void, searing targets with frostbite.A successful attack by a Spider of Ygiiz indicates the PC is grappled.If the player does not Defy Danger+DEX; the a Spider tears freezing chunks out of its victim, permitting a swarm of local natural spiders to swarm into the wound, eager to please their extraplanar allies.The Spider will Ygiiz makes a final attack attempt, crushing the spiders infesting the wound, releasing a flood of toxins (Defy danger versus DEX to escape). The target cannot be roused by allies from the toxic coma and only awakens with a successful Defy Danger versus CON save.The target may make three Defy CON attempts to awaken, but after three failed checks, the PC dies (Last Breath roll). Adapted from the classic DCC adventure &quot;The Jeweler that Dealt in Stardust&quot; by Harley Stroh. Instinct: Serve Ygiiz, the Demon Spider-Mother<br /><br />Grapple Prey<br />Command Spider Swarm<br />Infect Prey<br /><br />Boss Ogo	Solitary, Magical, Devious<br />Direct Spider Swarm	12 HP	0 armor<br />Close, Far<br />Special Qualities: Ygiiz Cultist, Controlled by the Crystal of the Outer Dark<br />The fences of Punjar are infamous for their cunning and greed, and Boss Ogo is no exception. Operating under the guise of a jeweler, Ogo does a brisk trade in stolen goods, enjoying the protection of a gang of bravos and thugs.But even the wary eye of a gang boss is no promise of surety in Punjar’s deadly environs. For the last month, no one has seen or heard from Ogo. The jeweler’s door is barred, his shutters locked, and no smoke escapes the shop’s chimney. Like ravens circling a stinking carcass, the bravos and pinch thieves of the Souk smell a fortune for the taking.Unbeknownst to his band, Boss Ogo yet lives—after a fashion. Nearly two months ago he fenced a gem stolen from a travelling sorcerer. Though appearing as a simple, rough amethyst, the crystal can serve as a portal and beacon to the beings of the outer dark. In his amateur study of the crystal, Ogo has undergone a conversion, believing that his role in this life is to usher Ygiiz, the Spider-Mother, into this realm. For the last month, he has spent every waking hour studying the crystal, seeking to activate its powers. Boss Ogo stands directly behind the crystal, one hand touching the stone, though the bulk of his frame is not immediately visible. Four Spiders of Ygiiz are feeding from his body. Ogo only becomes visible when the fuliginous extraplanar ticks detach from his body, revealing him bit by bit. Boss Ogo is haggard and gaunt, shrouded in drifting veils of cobwebs as spiders course over his skeletal frame. But his eyes are aflame with the madness of divine knowledge. On his silent command, the fell Spiders of Ygiiz move immediately to attack the PCs. For his part, Ogo does little more in combat than howl out at the PCs in madness. So long as he maintains contact with the crystal, Ogo is able to direct the natural spiders, causing them to swarm at his command. This is always accompanied by declarations of the PCs as heathens to be sacrificed to Ygiiz, the Spider-Mother. Ogo can target one PC, causing causing thousands of spiders to swarm over the PC (no roll needed). A swarmed PC suffers a -2 penalty to all rolls. If Ogo breaks concentration; then the swarm dissipates. The swarm dissipates immediately if the PC makes any action to sweeping the spiders from their body. Alternately, instead of directing the spiders, Ogo can attempt to summon an additional Spider through the crystal.Adapted from the classic DCC adventure &quot;The Jeweler that Dealt in Stardust&quot; by Harley Stroh. <br /><br />Instinct: Worship Ygiiz<br /><br />Spider swarm intruders!<br />Protect the Crystal of the Outer Dark<br />Summon Spider of Ygiiz<br /><br /><br />Sarzuk Rogue	Group, Organized, Hoarder<br />Short sword (w[1d6] damage)	3 HP	1 armor<br />Close<br />Special Qualities: Summon help via blackbird<br />Brutish break-in techniques (as adjudicated by the GM) alert these rogues. This pair has a small, trained blackbird kept in a hooded cage. At the first sight of trouble, the pair releases the bird. Keep informal track of time once the bird is released. Once Sarzuk and his rogues arrive, he sends six of these men in to flush out the PCs, while waiting outside with the rest of his band (Two per PC).(Adapted from the classic DCC adventure &quot;The Jeweler that Dealt in Stardust&quot; by Harley Stroh) <br /><br />Instinct: Obey Sarzuk<br /><br />Watch<br />Retreat<br />Backstab<br /><br />Sarzuk the Devil	Solitary, Stealthy, Intelligent, Hoarder<br />Longsword (d10 damage)	6 HP	1 armor<br />Close<br />In the Boss’ inexplicable absence, his second in command—one Sarzuk the Devil—has taken over leadership of Ogo&#39;s gang. Sarzuk has posted guards to watch over Ogo&#39;s shop, and is ready to mobilize the surviving gang members at the first sign of rogues in the house.

        <p>I love the descriptions of the monsters.<br /><br />This part is confusing to me:<br /><br />&quot;A successful attack by a Spider of Ygiiz indicates the PC is grappled, granting the Spider +2 to hit on subsequent attacks.On a successful second attack...&quot;<br /><br />Remember that DW does not allow for the GM to roll dice. Monsters getting a +2 to attack doesn&#39;t really make sense. <br /><br /></p>

        <p>That would need to be made into a fictional advantage for the spiders requiring a PC to do something to get away or possibly allowing the spider to make an automatic attack or move.  You could also make it a monster move to entangle with sticky webs.</p>

DCC is cool but mechanically so different that the text is still forcing a bit of that &quot;to-hit&quot; and &quot;save&quot; logic. More soon...</p>

        <p>Here’s my attempt. I turned the grapple attack into a move and changed your monster moves so that they are giving the GM additional options rather than doubling up what the attack does.
