Has anyone created race moves for cat people or any other beast races? Any other race moves people have created for races not included in the base playbooks that they&#39;d be willing to share?

        <p>Get Number Appearing from the Dungeon World website, also check out the race options here (sort by tag monstrous):<br /><br /><br /><a href="https://exposit.github.io/dw-playbooks/monstrous.html" class="ot-anchor">https://exposit.github.io/dw-playbooks/monstrous.html</a><br /><br /><br />Also there is a race-class tag but it seems to be broken; I&#39;ll try to fix it later tonight.</p>
