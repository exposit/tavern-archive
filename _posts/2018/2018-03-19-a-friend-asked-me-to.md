A friend asked me to make a couple adventure fronts for a &quot;Legend of Zelda game, but I don&#39;t want it to be EXACTLY Legend of Zelda&quot; campaign he&#39;s starting this weekend. I told him I could, but it&#39;s more fun (and the players will have more investment) if they grow organically. So I sent him this, using a modified &quot;Adventure Builder&quot; by <span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink" href="https://plus.google.com/109359281743079012976" oid="109359281743079012976">John Lewis</a></span>...<br /><br />We are heading to <b>a dungeon on a small island</b><br />which lies <b>in a kingdom told of in legend</b>,<br />seeking the <b>first of eight pieces of a powerful artifact</b><br />in order to <b>defeat a tyrant and rescue his royal prisoner</b>.<br /><br /><i>Start with these, then extrapolate outwardâ€¦</i><br /><br />What is the kingdom&#39;s name, and what legends are told of it?<br />Where in the kingdom is the island, and how will you get there?<br />What is the artifact, and why is it in 8 pieces?<br />Who is the tyrant, and how will the artifact help defeat him?<br />Who is the royal prisoner, and how did you learn of his/her imprisonment?<br /><br />I asked him to record the Q&amp;A for me, so when he gets it to me I&#39;ll post it here as a follow up.

        <p>Very cool!  From my read came out a bit darker than Legend of Zelda, but you never know where your players are going to take it.  What was Jim&#39;s reaction?  If it wasn&#39;t what he expected, I might suggest a tone discussion at the beginning about what he&#39;s going for and confirm they&#39;re excited about it.  Really cool regardless!</p>

        <p>Jim loves it! He&#39;s all about letting it go wherever it goes! The whole group is super excited! I love what they created with the prompts. I always like to see how other play groups make their worlds.</p>
