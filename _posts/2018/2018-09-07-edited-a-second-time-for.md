Edited a second time, for clarity.<br /><br />On GM-fatigue:<br /><br />I play mostly PbtA-games (BW, BitD are my other favorites + Fabula, a indie game that is 15+ years in the making of it&#39;s second edition.)<br /><br />I do find Dungeon World to be quite heavy to run, though, compared to other PbtA-games. Why that is I clearly have no idea. Maybe Fantasy is such a beloved genré, but I lack the knowhow to stay on top*? Maybe some players aren&#39;t suited to my favored playstyle with danger and adventure, and vice versa? Is there som granular stuff about the conversation I am missing?<br /><br />So, my silly examples that made my question drown aside: Is there a reason why Dungeon World is so difficult (for me) to run (compared to other PbtA-games)? <br /><br /><br />EDITED x2<br /><br />*) I am afraid to run The Veil because I feel I don&#39;t have enough experience and knowledge about the Cyberpunk genré a well, though I am not so frightened about The Sprawl.

        <p>&gt; The GM in Dungeon World should really be careful to allow a single player to dominate the world creation<br /><br />I&#39;m not exactly sure where this idea comes from that the players get a say in world creation at all. They definitely get more leeway, especially when it comes to their character&#39;s backgrounds and their history, but shouldn&#39;t get much of a say in the world as it is right now.<br /><br /><a href="https://mightyatom.blogspot.com/2010/10/apocalypse-world-crossing-line.html" data-embed="CNECCNACCM8CCAASS2h0dHBzOi8vbWlnaHR5YXRvbS5ibG9nc3BvdC5jb20vMjAxMC8xMC9hcG9jYWx5cHNlLXdvcmxkLWNyb3NzaW5nLWxpbmUuaHRtbDqhAQi1ztCn2ywSS2h0dHBzOi8vbWlnaHR5YXRvbS5ibG9nc3BvdC5jb20vMjAxMC8xMC9hcG9jYWx5cHNlLXdvcmxkLWNyb3NzaW5nLWxpbmUuaHRtbBpLaHR0cHM6Ly9taWdodHlhdG9tLmJsb2dzcG90LmNvbS8yMDEwLzEwL2Fwb2NhbHlwc2Utd29ybGQtY3Jvc3NpbmctbGluZS5odG1s0uSWmQHlAwpLaHR0cHM6Ly9taWdodHlhdG9tLmJsb2dzcG90LmNvbS8yMDEwLzEwL2Fwb2NhbHlwc2Utd29ybGQtY3Jvc3NpbmctbGluZS5odG1sGg9UaGUgTWlnaHR5IEF0b20itgJJJ20gc2VlaW5nIGEgdHJlbmQgaW4gc29tZSBvZiB0aGUgY3VzdG9tIG1vdmVzIHBlb3BsZSBhcmUgbWFraW5nIGZvciBBcG9jYWx5cHNlIFdvcmxkLiBCYXNpY2FsbHksIHNvbWUgbW92ZXMgYXJlICJjcm9zc2luZyB0aGUgbGluZSIgcmVnYXJkaW5nIHdoYXQgdGhlIHBsYXllcnMnIHJvbGUgaXMgYW5kIHdoYXQgdGhlIE1DJ3Mgcm9sZSBpcy4gSSB0aGluayBpdCdzIGEgYml0IG9mIGEgcHJvYmxlbSwgc28gSSdtIHdyaXRpbmcgdGhpcyBwb3N0IHRvIGxheSBvdXQgbXkgdGhpbmtpbmcuIFRoZSBMaW5lIEluIEFwb2NhbHlwc2UgV29ybGQgLi4u-hFLaHR0cHM6Ly9taWdodHlhdG9tLmJsb2dzcG90LmNvbS8yMDEwLzEwL2Fwb2NhbHlwc2Utd29ybGQtY3Jvc3NpbmctbGluZS5odG1s" data-attachment-render-hint="1" class="ot-anchor">https://mightyatom.blogspot.com/2010/10/apocalypse-world-crossing-line.html</a></p>

        <p>I control a lot of the gonzo with the way I ask questions re: world building. You don&#39;t just throw it wide open. 1) you address the character. So it&#39;s limited to something the character might know or have heard. And if it&#39;s hearsay the character is just creating a rumor in the world, not reality. 2) you frame the question so that it has boundaries that you are comfortable with. <br /><br />Examples. <br /><br />Bad: &quot;Criark the Barbarian, what do you know about the races of this world?&quot; <br />You just asked one player to add any/all races he wants to, including warforged style mechanical men and gray aliens and samurai and intelligent bunny-men. .... Oooh. Cool world. :)<br /><br />Better: &quot;Criark, your tribe often fought with another species from the frozen race. They were savage and feral. What species was it and what tribal custom made them so bloodthirsty?&quot;<br />You just asked Criark to add a race to your world but it gave the player some direction, made it personal, and kind of put some implied boundaries around it. <br /><br />But yeah, DW is the &quot;perfect&quot; game - if there is such a thing. You have some of the same problems as always. <br /><br />BTW, your rules lawyer is right about the Druid&#39;s move. It&#39;s in the book too (see the little sidebar text). :)</p>

        <p>My caveat that avoids a lot of this is that world building is up to the TABLE to agree on... not just me as the GM or that one dominate personality that is a player.... I do have one player who doesn&#39;t dominate the spotlight, but LOVES world building... and he does come up with a ton of good ideas.... and some not-so-good ideas.  Instead of shooting them down, I allow the other players to course correct the so-so idea by prompting them with &quot;what does the table think?&quot;... and often, the so-so idea is a springboard to a GREAT idea.. sometimes from my lil&#39; world builder, sometimes from me, sometimes from the other players.<br /><br />I have a very cooperative group at the moment.  I am very grateful of that.  <br /><br />But I find DW is a real good antidote to GM Fatigue because I don&#39;t have to do anywhere near as much work as other games.  When I get stuck during a session or trying to come up with a cost for a 7-9, I often ask the players what would be cool to have happen... to the point were they are pretty well trained and often suggest costs to failed rolls or partial successes.</p>

I was running DCC for months, and it’s not that crunchy. But the minute I switched to DW I felt really free again. I LIKE not being responsible for creating the whole world.</p>

        <p>Thanks for the link <span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink" href="https://plus.google.com/103667855585775066713" oid="103667855585775066713">Aaron Griffin</a></span><br /><br />While I agree with the sentiments of the Mighty Atom, and have read it in my Apocalypse World days, I&#39;ve only experienced this in DW. Maybe it&#39;s the Scope? Maybe it&#39;s the fact that I&#39;m not that certain about the Fantasy Genré, and like my Post-Apocalypse Weird and horrible, but my Fantasy Dark. <br /><br />Maybe it&#39;s the players more than the game: I know that me myself likes to state truths about the gaming world/setting as well.<br /><br /><br /><br />I am not adverse to the idea that I am not familiar enough with Fantasy as a genré to be comfortable GMing it, but it&#39;s strange to see.<br /><br /></p>

        <p>I&#39;m simply saying: if your problem is domineering players or taking advantage of narration rights, perhaps you should trying playing the game by the rules. Because DW does not afford players these abilities.</p>
