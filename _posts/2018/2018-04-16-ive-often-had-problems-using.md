I&#39;ve often had problems using the <b>Parley</b> move in <i>Dungeon World</i> (and the <b>Seduce &amp; Manipulate</b> move in <i>Apocalypse World</i>) but until now I never tried to express them in a communicable form.<br /><br />In the linked post I try to explain my gripes, and to offer a possible alternative solution. One that is now part of my personal DW reimagining, jokingly called <a rel="nofollow" class="ot-hashtag" href="https://plus.google.com/s/%23AdvancedDungeonWorldNext2/posts">#AdvancedDungeonWorldNext2</a> (or just <a rel="nofollow" class="ot-hashtag" href="https://plus.google.com/s/%23ADWN2/posts">#ADWN2</a> for short) (just a funny placeholder name for the project).<br /><br />Am I the only one experiencing those problems?<br />What are YOUR problems with that move?<br />How do you like my alternative move?<br /><br /><a href="https://plus.google.com/+AlessandroPiroddi/posts/CB6PvBs4bny" class="ot-anchor">https://plus.google.com/+AlessandroPiroddi/posts/CB6PvBs4bny</a>

        <p>Parley is just meant to measure how good your leverage is on a person. Be it a bribe, or promise of action/inaction.</p>

        <p>Looking at your analysis, we ended up very similar final moves. <br /><br />I definitely agree that the &quot;must have leverage to trigger the move&quot; is a big part of the issue, especially in a fantasy setting where people have alien goals and wants and you&#39;re dealing with dragons and all that.  <br /><br />I actually don&#39;t think it&#39;s a problem in AW, because:<br />1) Act Under Fire is <i>not</i> the same as Defy Danger; it&#39;s much more specific, and the overlap between it and Seduce/Manipulate isn&#39;t significant. <br /><br />2) The &quot;give them a reason&quot; is pretty easy to parse in a setting that&#39;s all about scarcity and sex. If you wheedle the bouncer &quot;c&#39;mon, you <i>gotta</i> let me in,&quot; it&#39;s easy to say &quot;uh yeah, they just stare at you like, fuck off. You wanna Seduce/Manipulate, give them a reason.&quot;  You can lie about the reason (<i>&quot;Dremmer told me to meet him here, he&#39;s gonna be pissed he finds out you kept him waiting&quot;</i>)  but good luck with that concrete reassurance on a 7-9.  I think that&#39;s <i>perfect</i>, really. <br /><br />3) Read a Person gives you a reliable way to find out what a good reason would be. <br /><br />But in DW, yeah... what the hell counts as leverage over a dragon? Or a mind flayer? By the time you&#39;ve figured out whether what you&#39;re doing/offering counts as leverage, it feels like you&#39;ve decided already whether the NPC will do what you want, and the roll is superfluous.  <br /><br />So, I went with a trigger of &quot;When you press or entice an NPC...&quot;. The idea being: have a clear trigger, where we can tell that the move is being triggered easily just based on what the PC is doing.  Wheedling the guard with &quot;c&#39;mon man, you <i>gotta</i> let me in&quot; WILL trigger this move.<br /><br />It&#39;s also usually pretty distinct from Defy Danger CHA. Trying to get someone to do a thing? Parley. Trying to fit in, pass off a lie, stall for time, or otherwise avert disaster through charm and grace? Defy Danger. (And if you call it one, and then realize it&#39;s the other, it&#39;s easy to switch.)<br /><br />Then, they clarify what they&#39;re after: &quot;...say what you want them to do (or not do).&quot; That&#39;s often going to be obvious, but having there in the move is good for clarifying expectations and setting stakes. <br /><br />Next is the caveat of &quot;If they have reason to resist, roll...&quot;.  You only go to the dice if they have reason to resist you.  If you&#39;ve just murdered a small horde of goblins and there&#39;s only one left and he&#39;s cornered and you&#39;re like &quot;throw down you weapon!&quot; there&#39;s no reason for him to resist, he makes with the grovelling. <br /><br />The roll then leads to &quot;On a 10+ they either do as you want or they reveal the easiest way to convince them.&quot;  The GM has to decide, now: is what the PC did to pressure/entice them enough? If not, how could they be convinced. And then they reveal that, through the NPCs words or deeds or the PC&#39;s shrewd insight.  To make this decision, the GM needs to consider what the NPC&#39;s reason for resisting is (good news: they should have already thought of that, to determine whether a roll was even needed) and whether the PC has addressed it.  The fact that the GM gets to pick also prevents the move from being a Jedi Mind Trick.<br /><br />&quot;On a 7-9,  they reveal something you can do to convince them, but it&#39;ll likely be costly, tricky, or distasteful.&quot;  And here we get the NPC&#39;s counter-offer, their ask for a bribe, the opening they give you for a big fat like that you&#39;ll need to pull off, the unfortunate revelation that you&#39;ll need to torture them, etc.<br /></p>

They could almost be interchangeable.<br /><br />I&#39;m not convinced by your 10+ result.<br />But maybe it just serves a specific purpose in <a rel="nofollow" class="ot-hashtag" href="https://plus.google.com/s/%23Stonetop/posts">#Stonetop</a> that is different from <a rel="nofollow" class="ot-hashtag" href="https://plus.google.com/s/%23ADWN2/posts">#ADWN2</a> ?<br />On a superficial level it looks to me that 10+ and 7-9 do the same thing.<br />7-9 is supposed to be more problematic.<br />10+ is supposed to be less so.<br />But in the end both outcomes seem to me to amount to<br /><i>What you did/said is not enough. Here, do/say this other thing.</i><br /><br />Which opens up the possibility that even a 10+ condition might result very problematic, fucking up a &quot;good success&quot;.<br />Maybe not in the GM&#39;s head, maybe not intentionally, maybe it was just meant to add a bit of color ... but I had Players hang grudgingly on some stupid detail that for me was meaningless, while to them it meant the world.<br /><br />On the other hand, the 7-9 could be as bland as, following one of the suggestions, ask the PC for a clear promise.<br />Which in and of itself is not a problem... 7-9 is supposed to be a success... but then it really becomes interchangeable with 10+ :P<br /><br />Am I wrong?<br />What was your aim there?<br /><br />About the rest.<br /><br />1) In AW the overlap isn&#39;t with <i>Act Under FIre</i> but instead with <b>Go Aggro</b>.<br />If I point a gun at you shouting &quot;step away!&quot; the fiction fits both Moves.<br />Then we must enter an open conversation about what the PC really means to do... and get into all the intricacies of Go Aggro.<br /><br />2) The problem is still there. You <i>give them a reason</i> but then somewhere else in the rules the procedures say that the MC has to evaluate your &quot;reason&quot; as leverage and decide <b>IF</b> the move is triggered or not.<br />Then, if you ignore this and just roll, and get a 7-9 ... the game grinds to a halt.<br />The PC won&#39;t know what to offer.<br />The GM won&#39;t know what to ask.<br />And if the GM asks for something the PC can&#39;t deliver <b>here and now</b> then the Player might feel cheated out of a successful roll, as the Move does ZERO to set the correct expectation for the outcome.<br /><br />3) In <a rel="nofollow" class="ot-hashtag" href="https://plus.google.com/s/%23ADWN2/posts">#ADWN2</a> you have both a <i>Read a Person</i> move an a <i>Threaten</i> move (equivalent to AW <i>Go Aggro</i>).<br />Still, a PC might not perform a Read Person before starting to Parley.<br />If the PLayer doesn&#39;t describe the PC as observing the NPC, it&#39;s not the move.<br />If the World suggest that observing the NPC might be helpful, but for any (legitimate) reason the Player thinks to describe otherwise, it&#39;s not the move.<br />There are plenty of instances in which a PC might get into a Parley &quot;blind&quot;.<br /><br />Besides, that&#39;s not the problem, for me.<br />Figuring out the leverage is not the problem I&#39;m addressing.<br />My problem is that the classic AW/DW wording for the Manipulate/Parley move makes it difficult for everyone to resolve the move as written.<br /><br />-<br /><br />About the fictional clarity of the trigger, I&#39;m with you 100% :)<br /></p>

        <p>I don&#39;t have problems with DW&#39;s Parley move anymore, though I definitely used to. Coming from D&amp;D made much of the game confusing to me for a long time. <br /><br />It looks like your main issue with Parley is that there&#39;s nothing that defines what to do if something the players offer as leverage is actually not leverage for an NPC. What I&#39;ve found with Dungeon World is that we&#39;re meant to be far more fluid in our GMing, making the game more of a conversation, rather than a mechanical thing. <br /><br />In D&amp;D, I had fully built NPCs with motivations and desires. In Dungeon World, my NPCs are built through their interactions with the players, and often it&#39;s their Parley rolls themselves that decide whether this leverage is appropriate to the NPC. <br /><br />However, you&#39;re fully free to step out of character and say, &quot;This is not leverage to this character, you&#39;d have to find something <b>they</b> want, but usually I let the roll play it out. This is just how I run it though, and I don&#39;t like to over-complicate things anymore.</p>

        <p>Also, I see Defy Danger as completely different to Parley. Defy Danger+CHA is clearly when the players <b>don&#39;t have leverage.</b> I leave it simply at that. When they are Defying Danger without leverage, they risk something going <b>really</b> wrong, even on a 7-9. A Parley, however, can go reasonably well even on a 7-9, only requiring maybe a little extra work to get what they want. Parley would nearly always be preferable to Defy Danger+CHA, at least in my games. <br /><br />Again, I don&#39;t claim to be the expert on Dungeon World, this is just how I run it at my table, as it seems to work great for me.</p>
