*SHIFTER *<br /><br />This was an old one I posted and the tavern perfected. I&#39;ll post the fixed version and a link to the original. Byfar this is my favorite alternative to the druid move....hands down.<br /><a rel="nofollow" class="ot-hashtag" href="https://plus.google.com/s/%23DungeonWorldCC/posts">#DungeonWorldCC</a><br /><br /><b><i>Shifter</i></b><br /><br /><b>When you drink the blood of an animal</b>, you may transform yourself into its likeness leaving behind your possessions. You have abilities and can perform tasks associated with the form. Hold HUMANITY equal to your WIS.<br /><br /><b>When you perform a form move,</b> reduce your HUMANITY by 1 (minimum of -3).<br /><br /><b>When you attempt to revert to your original form,</b> Roll+HUMAMITY<br />10+ You revert to normal.<br />7-9 You revert to normal, but have a lingering aspect of the animal which may express itself at inopportune times.<br />6- You are stuck as the animal till you fully rest.ï»¿<br /><br /><b>When you fully rest,</b> restore your HUMANITY and revert to normal without sideeffects.<br /><br /><a href="https://plus.google.com/105487846931822189120/posts/fsBP8Y3pu2W" class="ot-anchor">https://plus.google.com/105487846931822189120/posts/fsBP8Y3pu2W</a>

        <p>I like the reversal. Very nice, a grittier take on how the Druid gets their power.</p>

        <p>I might add a result for rolling a zero:<br />0- You are stuck as the animal forever<br /><br />I also wouldn&#39;t limit how low Humanity could go.</p>

        <p>That&#39;s cool. Although I&#39;ll keep the raw druid, I keep the idea of not being able to transform back for 6-!</p>
