Session Zero 6 - The Eternal is now available on DriveThruRPG<br /><br />A civilization that had torn itself out of time to avoid annihilation at the hands of The Destroyer of Ages has now appeared in our own age, deep below a modern dwarven village. Strange things are happening in the village above as souls that have been trapped for millennia are taking over the bodies of the living dwarves. Only the caretaker of the ancient civilization - The Eternal - knows that the dwarves of this age are the descendants of a clan of traitors that escaped the Soul Matrix long ago.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/235188/Session-Zero-Issue-6--The-Eternal?src=Gplus022618" class="ot-anchor">http://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/235188/Session-Zero-Issue-6--The-Eternal?src=Gplus022618</a>
