Just made a huge amount of progress on my Dungeon Rations: Food issue! (Being on an alaskan cruise without any internet helps a ton!)<br />An excerpt of a potential magic item from the zine:<br /><br />Candied Oracle<br /><br />They lost track of where and who these came from, so who can say it’s disrespectful to snack on them? These gummied remains of an oracle have a chewy and dusty texture, but taste slightly like a peach. <br />When you eat a candied body part, you wake up the next morning to discover that your respective body part has now been gummified. It can now sense the future, in a way that makes sense for the body part. i.e. ears can hear, eyes can see, etc. But everything they sense seems more... gummied. These senses are rarely guaranteed to be clear.<br />Your gummified body part can sense the future in any rolls that could apply, i.e. Discern Realities, Spout Lore, etc.<br />Some body parts might have more drastic consequences than others. Needless to say, it might be a bad idea to eat too many...<br /><br />

An excerpt of a potential magic item from the zine:

Candied Oracle

They lost track of where and who these came from, so who can say it’s disrespectful to snack on them? These gummied remains of an oracle have a chewy and dusty texture, but taste slightly like a peach.
When you eat a candied body part, you wake up</a>

        <p>When you say that you were on an Alaskan cruise, do you mean that you just got off one, as of this past Wednesday?</p>
