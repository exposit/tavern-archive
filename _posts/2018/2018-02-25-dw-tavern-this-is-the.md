Dw Tavern, <br />This is the first of three custom moves I have created for a new campaign front I am running. I would appreciate your thoughts. (Dennis, don&#39;t read this :) ). Thanks in advance.<br /><br />New Move - Mechanical Trap<br /><br />When you open a trapped sun aspect ark without looking for and/or finding and disarming a trap first, roll+DEX. On a 10+, you avoid the trap’s effect. On a 7 - 9, you avoid some of the trap’s effect; choose 1. On a miss, the GM chooses 2.<br /><br />1) Take 12 damage, ignoring armor, of a type relevant to the sun aspect ark you opened: <br />o	Hi-Ding: Sticky acid covers you and destroys all consumable items and 1 non-consumable item; <br />o	Sey-Ting: Cold frost sprays and numbs you, and for 1 hour then next miss you roll with a weapon destroys that weapon; <br />o	Noc-Turne: Poison darts pepper you, and your party members (6 damage) within close distance, ignoring armor; <br />o	Scal-Ding: A jet of fire sprays you, and all non-metal items are destroyed; <br />o	Ris-Ing: A floor column rises you into the air smashing you against the ceiling, and all metal items are destroyed. <br /><br />2) A deafening gong alarm sounds throughout the temple alerting any and all to your presence, and you and all your party members go deaf for 6 hours. All spell casting and verbal communication is impossible for 6 hours.<br /><br />3) Alter your alignment according to the sun aspect ark you opened (no effect if already the same alignment, but still form the bond).<br />o	Hi-Ding: Neutral, and immediately form an adverse bond with one of your items<br />o	Sey-Ting: Lawful, and immediately form an adverse bond with a chaotic PC<br />o	Noc-Turne: Evil, and immediately form an adverse bond with a good PC<br />o	Scal-Ding: Chaotic, and immediately form an adverse bond with a lawful PC<br />o	Ris-Ing: Good, and immediately form an adverse bond with an evil PC<br /><br /><br />

        <p>I dig your moves. I typically dont like moves to punish Magic users this much. Would you ever have a condition that says &#39;an alarm goes off and now combat PC&#39;s cant attack any more?&#39; Probably not. Or would you have a combat PC&#39;s attacks only deal d4 after a failed roll for 6 hours? What good or fun will nerfing a magic user result in? <br />It may be more fun to fictionally lean more on the deafness effect, as in, a magic user can throw a fireball, but the others couldnt hear the incantation and waltzed right into the killzone, etc.</p>

        <p>I get your point about complete nerfing. Maybe a -1 ongoing for spell casting to reflect the increased difficulty in forming the proper sounds. Negating all verbal comms I feel would still be appropriate. I definitely appreciate the feedback. Move is still in the creation phase.</p>
