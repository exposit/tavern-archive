Well I finally just bit the bullet and decided to publish something. I am excited to announce that my Compendium Compilation is available on Drivethru RPG! Some of you may remember the Monster Hunter compendium class that was mentioned in Discern Realities. Well it is in there, plus 12 other compendium classes of my own design!

        <p>Thanks! I designed it. Plan on using some variation of it for any other products I put out as well to make them recognizable as my products.</p>
