Dunno how much it can be useful to any of you but, meh, it&#39;s free!<br /><br /><b>The Virtuous</b>, a hack of the paladin that is focussed on virtues instead of religion. Not yet tested (first test session is tonight). Backgrounds are inspired by Chinese culture (to fit my player&#39;s concept for her character).<br /><br />I need to give credits to the peeps from <a rel="nofollow" class="ot-hashtag" href="https://plus.google.com/s/%23WorldofAdventure/posts">#WorldofAdventure</a> because I&#39;ve stolen quite a few moves from their Paladin playbook, and then some here and there (The Samurai and The Fated Hero), although I think I didn&#39;t keep any from these 2 &quot;as is&quot;.<br /><br /><a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1XLjjaMVgvrQoBTLkeLCzipJYkUEo9F71" class="ot-anchor">https://drive.google.com/open?id=1XLjjaMVgvrQoBTLkeLCzipJYkUEo9F71</a>

        <p>Looks really cool! Only note without play testing: on the Courage virtue, I don’t think half damage is an option on a defend move. I think it’s “do damage equal to your level” but could be wrong. <br /><br />Perhaps the Courage virtue could just be instead roll your damage, or roll your damage divided in half. <br /><br />Hope it helps!</p>

        <p>It&#39;s from Worlds of Adventure. It replaces the &quot;do damage equal to your level&quot;. I use this variant in my games.</p>

        <p>Robert Finamore on G+ created this template. I think it&#39;s on his g+ page somewhere or Google it</p>
