With the prophesied death of Google Plus, now seemed like the time for me to make some announcements.<br /><br />Firstly, we&#39;ll be moving over to MeWe: <br /><a href="https://www.mewe.com/join/worlds_of_adventure" class="ot-anchor">https://www.mewe.com/join/worlds_of_adventure</a><br />Not because I particularly like it, but because it seems to be the place where many of us G+ folks are moving to. There, you&#39;ll find a link to a new Trello board containing all the content I&#39;ve been working on for the last year for <b>Worlds of Adventure v0.3</b>.<br />If you&#39;d rather not join any new social media platforms you can, as always, find me and the project on the Dungeon World Discord too.<br /><br />Secondly, I&#39;m going to branch this project. The new rules are a drastic departure from Dungeon World. I know that many people liked Worlds of Adventure <i>because</i> it compiled many of DW&#39;s best hacks and supplements, and there&#39;s value in that. I&#39;ll be updating Worlds of Adventure to accommodate you.
