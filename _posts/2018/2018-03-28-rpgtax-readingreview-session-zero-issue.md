USD $2.99. <br />[^1]  <i>(affiliate links)</i><br /><br />&gt; <i>The Eternal</i> - which uses a deck of playing cards to randomize setup - is a mystery adventure akin to the old <i>“Against the Cult of the Reptile God”</i> module. You come to a village, see some strange<br />stuff, discover <i>why</i> strange stuff is happening, and deal with it. <br /><br />In true DW fashion, the adventure offers prompts to come up with a shared background and hooks. <br /><br />I like the idea of using cards to create the adventure. The cards influence the Big Bad, <b>The Eternal</b>, some other players, and the village. That makes the adventure re-usable - in theory. In practice, the idea behind the adventure is the same. So you&#39;ll know the secret behind the strange happenings of the Dwarven village. And that will limit its appeal to play it again.<br /><br />The author did a fabulous job of using the <i>Countdown Die</i> mechanism from ICRPG [^2] with tailored GM Moves to drive the action and provide clues to the mystery. <br /><br />Locations and background information offer enough material for several sessions. Obviously, the author put some work into coming up with custom moves, items and stats for <i>The Eternal</i>, and adventure locations. <br /><br />You can also link it with other adventures from the <b>Session Zero</b> line. (See [^3].) <br /><br />Layout and typesetting do a good job of not getting in the way. I glimpsed some decent black and white images. Overall, look and feel strike me as functional but nothing to write home. <br />No digital bookmarks but that&#39;s not necessary with 36 pages.<br /><br />I&#39;m itching to convert <i>The Eternal</i> to an old-school leaning RPG like <i>The Black Hack</i>. [^4]<br /><br />I liked SZ06 a lot and it sounds like it will be fun to play.<br /><br />I encourage you to take a look at Brian Holland&#39;s patreon campaign for the <b>Session Zero</b> zine.
