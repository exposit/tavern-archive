Now that <i>The Ranger</i> is done, it&#39;s time for another <i>Dungeon World</i> class vote!<br /><br />I remember there being a dryad and satyr on the previous list, so we decided to go with a fully Greek theme this time.<br /><br />(We know that ninja and geisha were also pitched, so the next vote&#39;s theme will be all Asian stuff.)<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" class="ot-hashtag" href="https://plus.google.com/s/%23dungeonworld/posts">#dungeonworld</a>
