So, over at The Gauntlet, we run a whole heck of a lot of games every month. At the moment, we have 214 sessions scheduled on Gauntlet Hangouts through August (and we have barely started putting things up for August). Many of those sessions are for Dungeon World, a game we love and play a lot.<br /><br />Our community takes the act of playing ttrpgs very seriously. We teach each other, we support each other, we celebrate each other. Our open table play culture is all about creating space for new people to get involved; you never have to have experience with a particular game, and you can attend even if you can only make a session or two. No experience with online games? Doesn&#39;t matterâ€“we want you here. You&#39;ll get up to speed very quickly with a group of fabulous people who will support you the whole way!<br /><br />For more info about Gauntlet Hangouts, check the link below. More $7 Patreon spots will be available July 1st!<br /><a href="http://www.gauntlet-rpg.com/gauntlet-hangouts.html" class="ot-anchor">http://www.gauntlet-rpg.com/gauntlet-hangouts.html</a><br /><br />Here is the full list of Gauntlet Hangouts games currently scheduled (bold entries still have space):
