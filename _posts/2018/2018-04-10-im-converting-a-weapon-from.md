I&#39;m converting a weapon from 13th Age to Dungeon World and I&#39;m not sure what is considered the best practice.<br /><br />Here is the line: &quot;once per level, on a critical hit, it can make an attack against anything—a shadow, a spell, an emotional bond, someone’s fate, someone’s death. The thing you target has to be within sword’s reach.&quot;<br /><br />Which I think is awesome, but I don&#39;t know how to translate the once per level on a critical hit part.<br /><br />One alternate is: when you hack and slash, on a 13+ hold 1. You can spend the hold to target anything [edit: the next time] you hack and slash. But I&#39;m not sure if that&#39;s correct.  Thoughts?

        <p>I really like the idea, but I&#39;m having a hard time thinking about it in terms of the fiction. The problem I&#39;m having is that they wade into combat, swinging at a specific foe (or foes) and then, because they rolled well, get to change their target.<br /><br />I&#39;d go along the lines of a new move that gives a really hard choice to the player if it&#39;s not an outright success. Maybe something along the lines of (warning, more thought is needed):<br /><br />Once per session, when you <b>call upon the power of the astral silver sword and strike</b>, name a target within reach (such as a shadow, a spell, an emotional bond, someone&#39;s fate, someone&#39;s death, etc.) and roll +STR. On a 10+, your strike is true. On a 7-9, you can make the strike, but something of your own will get cut, too: the GM will tell you what.<br /><br />Severing someone&#39;s fate could also, then, sever the characters&#39; own fate. Though, I&#39;m not sure exactly how an &quot;emotional bond&quot; could be within reach...</p>

I&#39;m new to DW so I kinda know what things should sound like but don&#39;t have the language myself.<br /><br />In any case, so it&#39;s not just a variant on the hack &amp; slash move, you&#39;d write an entirely new move for it?  And you&#39;re allowed to say once per session?</p>

        <p>Off the top of my head:<br /><br />When you use [swordname] to attack something intangible, roll +Str. On a hit that thing is wounded, for whatever that means. On a 10+ choose two, on a 7-8 choose one:<br />* You don&#39;t suffer commensurate harm.<br />* Someone you love doesn&#39;t suffer commensurate harm.<br />* You cut only what you intended to cut.<br /><br />My reasoning is that rather than limit powers to arbitrary milestones, I prefer to give players massive power then link it to terrible prices -- but that&#39;s very much a &#39;me&#39; thing.</p>

And the wielder of this sword is a barbarian with an appetite for pure destruction, so those are some excellent costs!</p>

        <p>You could also use the Barbarian&#39;s <b>Smash</b> power as a template.<br /><br />When you <b><i>roll 12+ to Hack &amp; Slash with the silver sword</i></b>, you deal your damage, avoid your enemy&#39;s attack, and name something intangible about them: a drive, a love, a passion, a fate, their shadow, etc.. It is severed and lost to them forever.</p>

        <p>Okay, I don&#39;t know of any best practices to speak of, but here are my thoughts.<br /><br />Take what you think is awesome, and leave the stuff that doesn&#39;t fit or make sense.<br /><br />If you are concerned about balance don&#39;t make magic items that do simple boring stuff like, +damage or extra attacks etc. Make things that do weird stuff, things that probably were not meant for combat, but maybe if you&#39;re creative could possibly work it in.<br /><br />Okay, that all being said, I would be careful of that trigger. Any weapon you give is probably going to be used by someone with a high strength, +2 min, but probably +3. This means that the 13+ will likely come quite often, especially considering other bonuses, like help,+1 forward, etc. This rate is probably higher then the crit rate of the original item, but maybe not.<br /><br />Maybe something like, &quot;When you focus and spend a beat channeling your will into the sword, name your target and roll +cha (I like charisma over wisdom like your trying to convince a sentient force to go along with you). On a hit the sword turns translucent and glows (ask what color and what that means) and the next strike will move through the physical to something otherwise intangible. On a 10+, the blade pulls you towards the target, take +1 forward when acting against the named target. On a miss, the blade may or may not activate, but be prepared for the worst.&quot;<br /><br />I like the trigger of needing a moment to activate, this means you can&#39;t always do this, and gives someone else the opportunity to defend the wielder, and can add some tension.</p>

        <p>An advanced move from the barbarian playbook could have the mechanics you&#39;re looking for. Can&#39;t recall the name right now...<br /><br />Trigger on 12+ and describe effects.</p>

        <p>This one!<br /><b>Smash!</b><br />When you Hack &amp; Slash, on a 12+ deal <br />your damage and choose something physical your target has (a weapon, their position, a limb): they lose it.</p>

        <p>If you go with a “swing at something intangible” move like those suggested by <span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink" href="https://plus.google.com/109474322129846473372" oid="109474322129846473372">Matthew DeKrey</a></span> or <span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink" href="https://plus.google.com/112980852725775937440" oid="112980852725775937440">Chris Longhurst</a></span>, I would definitely change it to “roll+nothing”.</p>

        <p>I think a normal attack should be the trigger, then roll no more, just declare what you hit in addition to your enemy.</p>
