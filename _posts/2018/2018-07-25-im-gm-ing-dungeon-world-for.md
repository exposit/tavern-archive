I&#39;m GM-ing Dungeon World for the first time (we&#39;re playing on RoleGate with some of the characters that survived a Funnel World adventure) and I came up with an interesting Druid animal-shape move I wanted to share and hear feedback about (whether someone&#39;s already done this before better than me, or you&#39;ve tried it and there&#39;s something I&#39;m missing).<br /><br />The assumption here is that the Druid is not able to speak in her animal shape (except if the animal she takes the shape of can speak in this world). Therefore I suggest that the Druid can use one hold to speak with her human voice in any of the shapes she takes, making this the first permanent animal-shape move that I&#39;ve seen in DW.<br /><br />Do I curtail this move to a few lines (Enemy is coming! Head for the trees!), or just let them speak throughout? I guess it will never come up when there&#39;s only one hold left, but right now my Druid has two holds left, so it could come in handy.

        <p>That&#39;s a cool idea! Maybe &quot;Spend 1 hold to speak a 4 or 5 word sentence in your <del>human</del> own voice.&quot; There are probably better ways to word it though.</p>

        <p>personally I&#39;d use &quot;a short phrase or message&quot;</p>

        <p>That wording also makes it sound like an advanced move my Druid can take when she levels up. :)</p>
