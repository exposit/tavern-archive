        <p>I don&#39;t (want to) think it&#39;s dead in the water. There&#39;s been some signs of progress. But back in August of 2017 Sage committed to having a draft by the end of August, and monthly drafts posted after that. There have been no drafts, and 3 updates.<br /><br />That said, the updates noted that there were content updates needed from both Sage and Adam along with design updates.</p>
