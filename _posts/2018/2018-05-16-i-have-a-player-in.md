     I have a player in my game that is playing the Warlock from the Wars and Wonder pack. We can&#39;t figure out the Invocation move. Does anyone know how to use this?

        <p>The Invocation move is a way for the player to announce that their patron is getting actively involved in their actions. Mechanically, it adds on to another move you’re making by adding in a few extra details about the patron’s involvement, as defined by the options of the move.</p>

The move is basically 2 parts. The one part is choosing how the Patron becomes involved in a move made. The 2nd part is what we are confused on. Without having the playbook in front of me it roughly says add a number of options from the move equal to WIS. So if the player is using defy danger what are defy danger&#39;s options he could choose from?</p>

        <p>You choose options from the Invocation list. Think of them as ways to add more fictional positioning to the existing move, as well as raising the stakes, since the GM can decide what happens if one of those options is false via 7-9, or not chosen (q.v. Bend Bars, Lift Gates).</p>

        <p>Okay I get it now. So my player faces an enemy and attacks using the move cast a spell. With a WIS +1 he might say the patron empowers his spellcasting and describe a ghostly image of his patron appearing behind him as the spell is cast. On a 7-9 I could have this be false and just not have the ghostly image.<br />   A 2nd question. The Warlock playbook doesn&#39;t mention a spell book. Does this mean he can cast any spells on his list as long as they arent more than his level +1 and he choose them during his commune time?</p>

        <p>Yes, the Warlock doesn&#39;t have a spellbook. Their spells are granted by their patron, similar to how a Cleric gets their spells.</p>
