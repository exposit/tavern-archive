Official Post from Brian Holland: The next issue of Session Zero will be out at at the end of this month and will feature a method for playing mass combat in Dungeon World!DW Mass combat is something I've worked on and play-tested a LOT (currently play-testing version 4.3.4) and I'm getting excited to finally be able to present it.
