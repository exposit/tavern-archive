Wand of Wonder (Minor Artifact)<br /><br />(0 Weight, 12 Uses per owner)<br /><br />A small ebony wand engraved with a star of chaos in silver.<br /><br />The wand of wonder is a strange and unpredictable device that will generate any number of strange effects, randomly, each time it is used. Some typical effects are shown on the table below, but you may alter these for any or all of these wands in your campaign as you see fit<br /><br />D100 	<br />Roll 	Effect <br />01-10 	Every magical or enchanted item present glows blue for a full hour <br />11-18 	Sleep as wand <br />19-25 	An  illusion of a frog appears and sings “It’s not easy being green” on a tiny banjo before disappearing<br />26-30 	Party surrounded by soap bubbles at 30-foot range <br />31-33 	Storm clouds and heavy rain falls for one round in 60-foot radius of wand wielder <br />34-36 	Loud booming laughter is heard<br />37-46 	Lightning bolt (70&#39; x 5&#39;) as wand <br />47-49 	Stream of 300 large butterflies pour forth and flutter around <br />50-53 	Magic Missile as wand <br />54-58 	Darkness in a 30-foot diameter hemisphere at 30 feet center distance from wand <br />59-62 	Grass grows in area of 160 square feet before the wand, or grass existing there grows to 10 times normal size <br />63-65 	Vanish any nonliving object of up to 1,000 pounds mass and up to 30 cubic feet in size (object is ethereal for 24 hours) <br />66-69 	A small rabbit appears and attempts to hop away<br />70-79 	Fireball as wand <br />80-84 	Invisibility covers wand wielder <br />85-87 	Target transformed (no save) into a Giant Amoeba (See below). Attacks everything nearby.<br />88-90 	10-40 gems of 1 gp base value shoot forth in a 30-foot-long stream, each causing one point of damage to any creature in path -- roll 5d4 for number of hits <br />91-97 	Illusions of playful sprites dance and play over a 40-by 30-foot area in front of wand for the next hour<br />98-00	Flesh to stone (or reverse if target is stone) if target is within 60 feet <br /><br />GIANT AMOEBA	Solitary, Large, Amorphous<br />Acidic Grab (d10 damage)	12 HP,	0 armor<br />A giant amoeba is a shapeless mass of living, liquid protoplasm. Though naturally translucent with darker interior spots, its surface is slightly sticky and tends to collect dirt and other debris from its environment; therefore, a moving giant amoeba looks like muddy water. A weaker cousin of creatures such as the gray ooze and black pudding the giant amoeba is the result of an alchemist&#39;s experiment gone horribly wrong. <br />Instinct: Dissolve flesh<br />•	Slithers<br />•	Mindless<br />•	Relentless<br /><br />The wand uses one charge per function. It may not be recharged. Where applicable, saving throws should be made. After a user has exhausted its charges the wand will vanish only to reappear somewhere else.<br /><br />

        <p>I like this but feel it would be useful if there was also a move that let you determine what the next use will be if you make it. Not sure what the miss would be. I like the gonzo.</p>
