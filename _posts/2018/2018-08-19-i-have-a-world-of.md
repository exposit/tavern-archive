I have a <b>World of Dungeons</b> question. <br /><br />So, I realize that no one probably plays to 10th level, but the RAW beg a question. At 10th level a player with maximum CON (+3) would be rolling 9 dice and keeping 10... Am I missing something? <br /> <br />

        <p>Well, they could only keep 9 since there would only be 9 HD. But they could just get Hardy at some point at that would be like having 10 HD</p>
