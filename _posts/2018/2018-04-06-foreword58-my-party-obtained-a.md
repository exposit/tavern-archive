Foreword: My party obtained a stone from a twin magic stone set that let you teleport anything from one stone to another. And they know that the other stone is right in the center of the main city, in the governmente quarter. (and they hate the city government for some reasons)<br /><br />In tonight session they were fighting a Devourer, and after a sequence of very unlucky dice throws, one of them find himself stuck inside the devourer&#39;s limbs.<br />I then use the devourer&#39;s ability &quot;Bargain for a soulâ€™s return&quot;. The immolator istantly says &quot;We can teleport you FROM HERE AND NOW in a place full of yummy souls! ...IF you free our comrade of course!&quot;<br />And the devourer doesn&#39;t even ask for a proof of that because the immolator rolls 12 at Parley!<br /><br />The devourer proceed to free the ranger and the immolator throws the magical stone to the monster, and with a pokeball-like special effect the devourer bumps into it and teleports to the center of the government quarter (and that discharges the stone)<br /><br />...Then, after a long debate to decide if they should kill all the guards that witnessed, they decide to just convince them that they have no idea about the location of the other stone.<br /><br />And everyone lived happily ever after!<br />Except some.. oppressor governor and stuff, maybe some innocent servant. Well, that&#39;s life!
