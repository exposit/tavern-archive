I tried to make a “Druid version” of the carouse move. I really just rewrote the trigger. It’s not a carouse move per se, but a move that has a similar effect.<br />The 6- wording feels like it could be more pointed? relevant? <br />Comments?<br /><br />When you walk among the flock, herd or pride of the wild, native animals as one of them, and learn what they know, tell us how long time it takes and roll+how many weeks you spend. (Max +3)<br /><br />*On a 10+ choose 3.  *On a 7-9 choose 1. *On a miss, you still choose 1, but it gets  really out of hand (the gm will say how).<br />-You befriend a useful npc/animal.<br />-You gain useful information.<br />-You learn of an opportunity.<br />-You are not lost in your animal shape.

        <p>I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s... Using enough of the druid&#39;s resources, I guess, though I am not sure what they could be. Time is wasted anyway, maybe... Have the druid just roll for his druid shape and then depending on how many holds he gets, that&#39;s how many things s/he can choose from the list instead of the usual druid shape moves?</p>

Having said that, I kind of like the idea of writing a class-based carouse. Regarding, &quot;lost in your animal shape.&quot; I assume that becomes a story hook. The other players have to trap him and help him come to his senses, or the druid struggles until he comes out of it, or you do a solo adventure with the druid as an animal? Otherwise that&#39;s just kind of straight up character death sentence.</p>

But the Druid is a playbook that manages fabulously on close to no resources, so what can you use? <br /><br />I wonder too if “weeks” makes the move unusable. In DW I’ve rarely had weeks to spend in-game. But as it is now the move could function as a basic love letter move for druids. <br /><br />Another option could be to just say “you leave something behind in the wild, tell us what and roll+WIS”. That way it is open to interpretation.<br /><br /><span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink" href="https://plus.google.com/100495092599585582455" oid="100495092599585582455">Ray Otus</a></span> I’m thinking “lost in your animal shape” does not mean lost forever. It was just the most obvious consequence I could think of.<br />And yeah, obviously a story hook opportunity.<br /><br />On the class-based carouse idea, were you thinking a more thorough rewrite of carouse? Or was that just a comment on what Emir said?</p>

I may take a crack at it myself later when my day settles down. <br /><br />Don’t worry about the two week time frame. It’s a special move meant to encapsulate downtime. Having said that I would be more vague. Like “When you spend a significant amount of time...” or maybe “a few days to a few weeks.”</p>

The two “you learn” ones are just “get a useful bit of info” but I like to help GMs who might struggle with coming up with different ideas. It’s not meant to be prescriptive.

So she turns into a bear, she has moves:<br />* Find honey.<br />* Maul them like they&#39;re Leo DiCaprio.<br />* Smarter than the average bear.<br /><br />She&#39;ll stay that way for a longer time? Cool, existing list of moves<br /> expands by a &quot;permanent list&quot; for druidic carouse and however many holds she has (let&#39;s say 3) she spends them like this:<br />* Befriends the bear Baloo<br />* Brings him to honey<br />* Together they find out a plot to kill off all bees and stop the production of plums in this area.<br /><br />Not all at once but as their interactions progress, you have a mini adventure and as she turns back into human shape on that last spent hold, they say goodbye until next time.</p>

But I dislike it for the time involved too. Another option is to make the trigger less loaded... Like: If it were just &quot;follow the flock, herd, or pride and learn what they know&quot; that also says you&#39;ve got to be in position to do it.  That <i>could</i> take weeks (and perhaps you say that in the subtext, since this seems harder than finding out what a person knows.. but I digress) but.. it could also be shorter (or far longer!) depending on the circumstances.<br /><br />To play up the intent, you might offer a new kind of stat (their &quot;friendship level&quot; to the animals, so to speak). A rising and falling variable -3 to +3 reflecting their actual closeness. <i>to avoid just.. using +Charisma, but also avoid this time measurement Thing</i></p>

        <p>That&#39;s an interesting thought <span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink" href="https://plus.google.com/105116536507539796451" oid="105116536507539796451">Morten Halvorsen</a></span>. And I agree that the way it&#39;s written sounds more suited for a Love Letter, with the weeks requirement and all.<br /><br />I consider Carouse to be roughly equivalent to BitD&#39;s Vice in terms of fictional justification. DW seems to assume the PCs get so stressed while dungeoneering that they just can&#39;t avoid throwing wild parties when in town.<br /><br />An alternative way of handling a druid&#39;s Carouse could be:<br /><br /><i>When you discard the shackles of civilization to run free in the wild</i>, tell the GM how far do you push and roll:<br />+1 if you discard your civilized equipment before you go.<br />+1 if you permanently return a valued possession to nature, yours or someone else&#39;s.<br />+1 if you free a captive brother as well.<br /><br />...on a 10+ choose 3, on a 7-9 choose 1:<br />a. You befriend a useful wild spirit<br />b. You learn something that only an animal could have discovered<br />c. You learn a forgotten secret of the wilderness<br />d. You don&#39;t savagely strike a symbol of civilization</p>

You&#39;re letting go of your human (/elf/halfling/what have you) side and running free in the wild.  It also had associations with releasing a creature into the wild.<br /><br />But then along came the associations from Frozen.  Although, since that&#39;s a song about letting your power go free and revelling in it, it&#39;s not inappropriate for this move either.</p>

        <p>I am a fan of Jack London, but Don the Mantle of the Wild or Let Go of the Matnle of Civilisation could both work. <br /><br />I think the trigger has to be semented in the fiction before one changes to many moves, and I also wonder why Druids can&#39;t carouse at the roadside inn like the Paladin or the Ranger?<br /><br />To talk of hypetetical techniqalities the trigger should include the shedding of sivilisation, perhaps by returning coin (or other metal) to the mountains or letting go of the trappings of civilisation in other ways.<br /><br /></p>

        <p>I think we know they can&#39;t trigger it in the inn because that&#39;s not going to be &quot;the wild&quot; but I agree for some fictional text to accompany it, if for nothing else than to ensure it stays close to the intent.</p>

This is just a theoretical and fun (hopefully) exercise.</p>

It&#39;s fun, and good to have in the Arsenal.<br /><br /> I must admit that this was something that would have been cool to experience in a game, maybe as a Love Letter for a Druid-player who&#39;d lost a session or two? <br /><br />I really like that coin and treasure is part of DW so I think this should be in addition to Carouse, but then again I never got to experience getting loot in games myself so I might be thorouughly biased.<br /><br /><br />I think I&#39;d like 6- options of Nature giving demands of the Druid.<br /><br /></p>
