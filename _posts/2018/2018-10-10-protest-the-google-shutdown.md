        <p>I dunno, man. I&#39;m sad as well, but as a product manager myself it&#39;s hard to imagine what a petition could do in this case. Unlike a TV show where you could argue the network hasn&#39;t measured demand accurately, Google knows exactly how much usage G+ gets, what it costs them, and whether that&#39;s worth it to them. Far more useful would be a drive to get G+ die hards to bring in new users, so there is a spike in usage. Even then if Google doesn&#39;t have a strategy for how G+ being popular works for them overall, even at 10x the usage they should kill it.</p>

If nothing else it may encourage someone to present our community with better options that are currently being offered. What is really the harm?</p>

        <p>And this is what I don&#39;t like about a lot of the sites like this petition site, I go to sign the petition I have no problem putting MY name and email address on it, but now they want me to share it or donate $3. I don&#39;t have $3 to donate. I am not sharing my contacts in G+. I don&#39;t do Facebook. I guess I don&#39;t sign the petition.</p>

        <p>Google Reader was much more used that + and nothing saved it. The best argument to save + is that the impermanence of Google services causes an adoption barrier for any new services they offer. Ever since Wave I&#39;ve been leery start using new google offerings, it&#39;s part of why I was slow to adopt + and why in all likelihood I won&#39;t use whatever silly product google rolls out next to try and take marketshare from someone more innovative.</p>
