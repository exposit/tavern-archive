Quick question I saw elsewhere: &quot;When a move offers choices (choose 2, for example), may the player choose the same option more than once?&quot;<br /><br />I&#39;d say no, but I don&#39;t remember any official rulings about it.

        <p>When it makes sense, yeah, why not?</p>

        <p>Had the same question last game. One of my player plays The Priest and has a move to heal 1d8, +1 armor forward and repulse enemy. Was wondering if he could repulse twice.</p>

        <p>Choosing one twice is not choosing two. Combining any of those results would be very powerful. So if the player bring it up, make them justify it in the fiction. Don&#39;t be inclined to be generous, but be fair - you are a fan of the PC after all.</p>

        <p>Follow-up question: when you can spend Hold, 1-to-1, you can choose the same option twice?</p>

For example: in &quot;defend&quot; you can choose multiple &quot;reduce damage to a half&quot; for the same attack, but its ilogical to select twice &quot;redirect&quot; (unless) there are more than 1 attack involved. &quot;Do your level as damage&quot; its hard too, cause you want defend as a defensive move, but maybe there are 2 enemies, or you have 2 weapons, or you are &quot;fast as lightning&quot;, etc. <br />Fiction demands</p>
