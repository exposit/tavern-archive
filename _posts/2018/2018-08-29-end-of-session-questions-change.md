<b>End of Session questions</b><br /><br />Change the question<br />    <i>&quot;Did we learn something new and important about the world?&quot;</i><br />to<br />    <i>&quot;Did we cross a threshold into new and unknown danger?&quot;</i><br /><br />It still deals with discovery. But, suddenly the players get points not for their philosophical musings, but for penetrating deeper, more dangerous areas and exploring the unknown.<br /><br />What questions have you changed, whether for a session or for a campaign? How did it affect play for better or worse?

        <p>&quot;Did we overcome a notable monster or enemy?&quot; --&gt; &quot;Did we overcome a notable challenge?&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Did we loot a memorable treasure?&quot; --&gt; &quot;Did we gain a memorable reward?&quot;</p>

        <p>Thanks, <span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink" href="https://plus.google.com/105745999495605206550" oid="105745999495605206550">Thomas Schellenberg</a></span>. I&#39;m guessing these were questions you used for more than just 1 session. Is that right? I&#39;m curious how it affected play?</p>

        <p>Yes, they were campaign changes.  From my perspective as the GM, it allowed me to expand the content of our sessions, so I didn&#39;t feel limited to overcoming monsters or looting treasure.<br /><br />If we spent a session without fighting enemies, but the PCs successfully persuaded the monarch to help them, or they solved a hard puzzle, they could still earn End of Session XP (if those events were notable and challenging).  Likewise if they earned a notable non-monetary reward, like useful knowledge or reputation.<br /><br />Sure, using RAW, I could still run these sessions, but the PCs would be missing out on some XP that I personally think they deserve.  The current End of Session rewards are focused on traditional dungeon delving; this is fine for many people, but I want to facilitate a broader range of adventures.</p>
