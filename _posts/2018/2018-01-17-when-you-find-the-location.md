When you find the location of the Hillman&#39;s home and bring a suitable gift, he will invite you in his home and challenge you to a game.<br /><br />Roll +Con if you try to outdrink him<br />Roll +Str if you arm wrestle him<br />Roll +Dex if you play dice<br />Roll +Cha if you recite poetry<br />Roll +Int if you give him a riddle<br />Roll +Wis if you try to see through his trick.<br /><br />On a 6- you pay a terrible price for your learning. You lose an eye/ear/voice(receive a suitable debility) but gain +1 forward once a session for the stat you rolled.  <br /><br />7-9 you may leave without boon or scar or take both.  Lose eye/ear whatever and take boon (roll 3d6 for stat of choice and take higher two).<br /><br />10-11 you take the boon and gain no scar<br /><br />12+ you may take two boons for one scar<br /><br />15 you may take two boons with no scar.<br /><br />This is only a slightly refined rough and suggested improvements are much welcome.<br /><br />

        <p>This move is partly inspired by the myth of Odin trading his eye for a sip of the well of wisdom.  <br /><br />And more from the book &quot;Otto of the silver hand&quot; where it is said that One eyed Hans drank with the Hillman and gained the strength of ten men.  He would have rolled a 10+ on his roll.<br /><br />Not sure if the stat you roll should be one you get the boon for, or if you can choose which stat you want.  I think GM discretion is best.</p>

        <p>Just noticed the STATS aren&#39;t in &quot;standard&quot; order, +CHA should be the last entry.</p>

        <p>I&#39;d almost use this for a &quot;Bustling Tavern&quot;</p>
