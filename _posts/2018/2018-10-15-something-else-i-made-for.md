Something else I made for the upcoming game with the family. I also have frogmen. I see potentially a set up where there is a bit of an ongoing conflict between the frogmen and the Gromes. The girl likes faeries, and is playing an elf fighter. I think potentially this might appeal in a game. I like how they can potentially be friends or foes, and not just a foe to kill. <br /><br />There is some interesting (at least to me) ideas that came while writing it up, especially with a Druid in the party. I left it a bit open ended to see what develops in play. <br /><br />I may not use them at all, depending on what happens but want to have some prep in case I need it. <br /><br />I called them Gromes vs. Gnomes to evoke something a little different from the tropes of gnomes that have grown about DnD in its various incarnations. <br /><br />I appreciate no one will probably read this as everyone is on MeWe or somewhere, but I believe in sharing what I develop. I will put out the very brief dungeon starter after session 0, when it is more developed.

The Gromes (also sometimes called gnomes) live on the Furthest West of the Mystery Islands. No one knows why they aren't found on the mainland. The can at times be flamboyant and make a great sweet and frothy beer that carries quite a kick. They wear multi-colored patchwork jackets and pants, and long hoods. They are well armed with sharp pointy swords and a clever hand cross-bow. They have befriend the Great Silver Herons (semi-intelligent mythi...

        <p>I feel obliged to reply simply because I&#39;m not planning on moving to MeWe any time soon :)<br /><br />I think Terry Pratchett&#39;s &quot;Nomes&quot; in his Truckers/Diggers/Wings book series used the trick of spelling the name differently to make them their own thing.  It&#39;s quite an effective technique.<br /><br />Re: your comment about &quot;the girl likes fairies&quot;: When I first started roleplaying with my kids about a dozen years ago (playing D&amp;D 3.5) my daughter played a wizard using a custom &quot;fairy&quot; race I came up with.  She loved it, because the fairy was so tiny that it got a massive size bonus to AC, and combined with the ability to fly, it meant that she was nearly always able to keep safely out of harm&#39;s way.</p>
