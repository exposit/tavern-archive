Today we launched our Dungeon World Basics series on the Discern Realities podcast. If you know anyone who is DW-curious (or if you yourself are), this should be a really great resource. It includes roughly 20 minutes of topic discussion and 20 minutes of (very good) actual play. <br /><br />Check it out and let us know what you think!

        <p>I love this! I feel like I&#39;ve picked up a few things even as a long time player/GM.</p>

        <p>Agreed. Long time listener and DW player and still enjoyed this a lot. Great idea to do a small let&#39;s play in the footsteps of shaklecrow. The fact that I knew what were behind those grates and that I knew what happened last time created such a tension it was fantastic!</p>

It was our way of saying &quot;We&#39;re doing this new thing for awhile, but we haven&#39;t forgotten about you.&quot; Glad you liked it!</p>
