Kitsune of Japanese Myth<br />For +Andrea Parducci<br /><br />KITSUNE<br />Solitary, Stealthy, Intelligent, Hoarder<br />Talons (w[2d8] damage)	12 HP,	0 armor<br />Close<br />Special Qualities: Shapeshifter, Illusionist, Trickster Guardian<br /><br />Kitsune  is the Japanese word for the fox. Foxes are a common subject of Japanese folklore; in English, kitsune refers to them in this context. Stories depict them as intelligent beings and as possessing paranormal abilities that increase with their age and wisdom. According to Y≈çkai folklore, all foxes have the ability to shape shift into human form. While some folktales speak of kitsune employing this ability to trick others‚Äî as foxes in folklore often do‚Äî other stories portray them as faithful guardians, friends, lovers, and wives. Foxes and humans lived close together in ancient Japan; this companionship gave rise to legends about the creatures. Kitsune have become closely associated with Inari, a Shinto kami or spirit, and serve as its messengers. This role has reinforced the fox&#39;s supernatural significance. The more tails a kitsune has‚Äîthey may have as many as nine‚Äîthe older, wiser, and more powerful it is. Because of their potential power and influence, some people make sacrifices to them as to a deity. Conversely foxes were often seen as &quot;witch animals&quot;, especially during the superstitious Edo period (1603‚Äì1867), and were goblins who could not be trusted (similar to some badgers and cats). <br />Instinct: Cast Illusions<br /><br />Pretends to be human<br />Shape shifter<br />Be resourceful for evil or good<br />
