The party tries to deliver the compass to the dwarven leadership of the Halls of Wright. However even with the assistance of the biggest celebrity in town, bad luck seems to follow them, adding a complication to the delivery. Starring Mike Robertson(Big Boss Dungeoneer), Jeffrey Nye(Luddy), Ronnie "Verge" Whitmire(Kadrian), Brandt Wetzel(Stink-eye), Craig Pate(Tomas) and Special Guest Dan Vail(Toff). dungeoneerspodcast.com | facebook.com/dungeone...
