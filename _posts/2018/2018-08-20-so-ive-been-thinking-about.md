So I’ve been thinking about this skit a lot lately.  I’m thinking most bbeg’s would not want to stroll past all the foul creatures they keep in their lairs.  So that makes me think about back doors and secret passageways that bypass major parts of dungeons.  <br />All of which makes me ask how many are to many and should the players ever find that super easy path in?

        <p>Yes, if they look for it, or stumble into it by luck:<br /><a href="https://thealexandrian.net/wordpress/13085/roleplaying-games/jaquaying-the-dungeon" class="ot-anchor">https://thealexandrian.net/wordpress/13085/roleplaying-games/jaquaying-the-dungeon</a></p>

        <p>In my very first Tunnels &amp; Trolls campaign, the players were exploring a dungeon under the city. In one area, they found a staircase that went up, but the top was closed off with masonry, level with the ceiling.<br /><br />They scouted around town and found the adjoining property—an abandoned shop—was for sale. They bought it with previous loot, and set off explosives in the basement to open up a new entrance into the dungeon, so they could come and go as they wanted, without backtracking through dangerous areas.<br /><br />The dungeon creatures didn&#39;t like that. After they caught on, some of the intelligent and organized monsters set up new security protocols to keep the delvers out. One time, the delvers went down their new stairway into the dungeon only to find it covered with oil. Slipping and crashing to the bottom, they barely had a chance to catch their breath when a monster in the shadows made a spark and set them all on fire.<br /><br />So there are ways to deal with multiple exits that don&#39;t make the dungeon too easy. But it&#39;s also fun to reward creative thinking.<br /><br />After clearing the dungeon, the delvers hired some of the surviving monsters and used the shop as a dungeon-delver training center. Level 1 crawdad-shuckers could pay them to go down and fight actor-monsters with padded weapons and disarm non-lethal traps.</p>

        <p>Oh, and their amateur demolitions in the basement damaged the foundation, causing the whole shop to teeter.</p>
