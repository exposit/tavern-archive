Hi all, <br />I have a question about GM moves. I&#39;ve been running the game for a bit now, and I love it. I really like the 7-9 idea, but I want to make sure I&#39;m using it correctly. I like to learn the rules before I start to hack. My question is, if there is a predefined outcome for the 7-9 roll in the move, does that mean that you don&#39;t make a soft move? Like, take the 7-9 on a Druid Shape-shift or similar move, would that be consequence, or would it enable you to make a &quot;soft move?&quot; I&#39;m probably overthinking it, but just wondered how you all deal with this.

        <p>I&#39;m fairly certain just about every move has a predefined outcome for the 7-9 results. But a more direct answer to your question is &quot;no&quot;. From my interpretation, hard and soft moves are two varieties of GM moves, and the GM only makes those on a 6-, when the fiction dictates, or when the players hand you a golden opportunity.</p>

        <p>You make a move:<br />* When everyone looks to you to find out what happens<br />* When the players give you a golden opportunity<br />* When they roll a 6-<br /><br />Thing is, that first one?  Happens all the time. <br /><br />So, on a 7-9 Defy Danger, the move says &quot;the GM will offer a hard bargain, an ugly choice, or a worse outcome.&quot; The player rolls the dice, tells you they got an 8. They maybe read the 7-9 result outloud.  Everyone looks at you. What do you do, GM?<br /><br />You make a move, constrained by the rules. Your move must involve a hard bargain, an ugly choice, or a worse outcome. You don&#39;t have to, like, consciously think &quot;ah! an opportunity for me to make a move, I choose <b>tell them the consequences and ask</b>&quot;.  You&#39;re probably going to go &quot;let&#39;s see, how about a hard bargain... you can slip free of the treant&#39;s grasp but you&#39;ll have to leave your backpack behind, do you?&quot;  <br /><br />Let&#39;s say the player agrees... you ask them to narrate wriggling free but leaving their backpack behind. Or you do the narration.  That&#39;s resolved. Now what? Do you talk? Does the player talk?  If the player doesn&#39;t talk, all eyes are on you. You make a move (<b>use up their resources</b>) and say how the treant moans in rage and crushes the backpack in it&#39;s hand as it lumbers towards you, what do you do?<br /><br /><br />As for the druid&#39;s shapeshifter: they roll a 7-9, and the rules tell us that the druid becomes whatever and has 2 hold. Cool. Maybe there&#39;s some discussion of what this form&#39;s moves are. You work that out.<br /><br />Now, one of three things happens (more or less):<br />* The player seizes the conversational initiative and starts describing what they do.<br />* Everyone looks at you and go &quot;cool, so you&#39;re a python now, what do you do?&quot; (Which is arguably you tacitly <b>offering them an opportunity</b>.)<br />* Everyone looks at you and you make a move (probably a soft one).  &quot;cool, so you&#39;re phython now, but as you changed shape, the werewolf tackled and pinned Moira, you can see it&#39;s about to bite her, what do you do?&quot;<br /><br /><br />My point being: yes, you can make a GM move on a 7-9. Sometimes the move results specifically tell you to (e.g. on Defy Danger or Hack &amp; Slash), sometimes because resolving the move naturally leads the conversation to the point where everyone is looking at you. In which case: make a soft move, ask what they do, go from there.</p>
