My players really enjoy anime Shokugeki No Soma (foodwars) and even make competitions in food war before sessions. Last time I decided to create an award for a winner connected to it so here it is. Few notes - they prefer items with clarified effects so here they are quite exact. But interesting fact appeared: thanks to &quot;collecting ingredients&quot; they began interact much more with the world.<br /><br />Feel free to use it or give some another ideas.<br /><br />Senzaemon´s Small Healing Pot (1W, applied)<br /><br />Small breakable ceramic pot decorated by some strange signs: 薙切 仙左衛門 (one of the anime characters). <br /><br />When you have a time to collect ingredients (harvest, hunt, buy, etc.) to prepare a fine meal (your choice) and find enough time<br />to prepare it for 2 characters (your choice), roll 2d6+INT.<br /><br />10+ choose 2<br />7-9 choose 1 (GM chooses a cost or complication)<br />6- choose 2 and reverse (or GM decides, depands on fiction)<br /><br />- The consumer´s body enjoys the healing power of ingredients. Heal 1d8 HP.<br />- The food strenghten your body. Add +1 modifier to STR rolls. Effect lasts 1 day.<br />- The food is full of energy and you feel you can crush anything in your way. Add 1d4 to your damage rolls. Effect lasts 1 day. (here I was thinking about best of 2 dmg dies but players like to roll various dies)
