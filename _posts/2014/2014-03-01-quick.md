Quick!  I need stats for an ROUS!!<br /><br />I have described it as being &quot;chest high&quot; to the 2-headed ettin, and having front teeth &quot;as long as zir forearm&quot;. It&#39;s already been blasted by the ettin&#39;s fireball, and is badly singed, but charging. I need a move or two, a tag, some HP, etc...<br /><br />(This is for play-by-post, so no absolute panic, but in the next few hours or day would be terrific).

        <p>As far as moves, how about:<br />- Bowl someone over<br />- CHOMP<br />- Gnaw through anything, given time<br />- Snatch something it perceives as valuable and carry it off</p>

        <p>This was suggested by one of my players:<br /><br />ROUS (Rodent of Unusual Size)				<br />Group, Large, Organized, Intelligent, Hoarder<br />Gnaw (d8+4 damage, 1 piercing) 14 HP 1 Armor<br />Close, Reach, Forceful, Messy<br /><i>_______________________________________________________</i><br />￼Rodents of Unusual Size? I don’t think they exist. Instinct: To devour<br />• Leap forward and rip something (or someone) apart<br /> • Swarm something (or someone)<br /><br /><br />Notes (rather, what I chose based on the Monster Creation Guide - have a read if you get any spare time, it&#39;s really neat and easy to create monsters on the fly with):<br />• Group (2-5), base damage d8, 6 HP<br />• As big as a cart: large, close, reach, +4 HP, +1 damage<br />• Leathers or thick hide: 1 armor<br />• Unrelenting strength: +2 damage, forceful<br />• Uncanny endurance: +4 HP<br />• It’s armaments are vicious and obvious: +2 damage<br />• It’s armaments can slice or pierce metal: messy, +1 piercing<br />• It organizes into larger groups that it can call on for support: organized, write a move about calling on others for help<br />• It’s as smart as a human or thereabouts: intelligent (GM, I’ll let you decide that - rats are pretty smart, after all)<br />• It collects trinkets that humans would consider valuable (gold, gems, secrets): hoarder (GM, again, your decision on this one)</p>

        <p>Woops, I was going to re-post it here and forgot. Thanks <span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink" href="https://plus.google.com/114641545358319012147" oid="114641545358319012147">Gillian Wiseman</a></span> <br /><br />I was actually iffy on the Hoarder tag, having forgotten the fact that the ROUS were part of Fatheril&#39;s Experimental Zoo collection; but, then again, Ettin Wizards always love collecting unique items.</p>
