Few questions  that arose from tonights game: <br /><br />#1 When your players loot corpses, do you let them roll once for every corpse or do you take the whole group into account and just roll once? I did once for each corpse and it was great. <br />#2 Shadows, what is their deal? How would you think do they work metaphorically. What can hurt them and what can&#39;t? Mostly looking for inspiration, not one true answers.

        <p>Only fire made from a dead mans bones can purge a shadow.</p>

        <p>#1 I just add +1 per corpse on the loot roll, unless the victims in question were poor or ill equipped.<br /><br />#2 Shadows are the base desires that we all have. They are the dark reflections of our soul. The are created when someone makes a deal with a dark power for what they want. Then their desires become manifest. Yet the shadow is not content with just being a desire. They want to become the one they reflect. They can be hurt by physical means but that is not a good way to go about it. The fastest way to banish a shadow is to catch it in the reflection of light.</p>

What was in the pockets of e other guys? Nothing?</p>

        <p>They&#39;re bandits -- they probably don&#39;t carry anything, <span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink" href="https://plus.google.com/110330901807759406775" oid="110330901807759406775">Tim Franzke</a></span>. All their valuables are back at the hideout. At that point, I&#39;d probably give out reasonable loot based on how awesome they are at being bandits (based on what we&#39;ve learned through playing).<br /><br />Getting only one interesting thing off a party of 8 or whatever bandits makes perfect sense to me.</p>

        <p>Hey <span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink" href="https://plus.google.com/110330901807759406775" oid="110330901807759406775">Tim Franzke</a></span> , remember the old Loot move? Maybe you could re-visit it. I still use it and then roll on the treasure tables for specifics.<br />Loot (Wis)<br />When you search a monster’s lair or a group of bodies, the GM will tell you what gold and gems the monster had, roll+Wis. On a 10+, choose 2. On a 7-9, choose 1.<br />✦ You find it quickly<br />✦ You find it with little trouble<br />✦ Something you find has useful information, the GM will<br />tell you what<br />✦ Something you find has magic about it, the GM will tell<br />you what<br />A single lair or group of bodies can only be looted once.</p>

        <p>I think Rolling multiple times is no problem since &quot;too much treasure&quot; isn&#39;t a thing.</p>
