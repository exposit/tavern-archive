I&#39;m back to working on my supplement Lands of the Dead. Currently I&#39;m adding more content, but I&#39;l love to hear from players, GMs, and readers about what kind of content they want more of for their games.<br /><br />-How important or useful do you find the following supplemental materials when playing or GMing Dungeon World?<br /><br />New rules/systems<br />New locations and world lore<br />New monsters, threats, and dangers<br />Fronts and adventures<br />New NPCs<br />Full Classes<br />Compendium classes<br />New single moves<br />New magical items<br />Character art<br />Landscape art<br />Logos, icons, and symbols art<br />Maps<br /><br />-How much material from supplements do you use as presented, and how much do you use as inspiration or piecemeal?

        <p>All of these are welcome to DW though the new rules just need to be tested beforehand as those might be the only sticky part along with the new classes/moves. Rest sounds like it will be quite fun.</p>

        <p>WOW! I&#39;m really excited with this awesome news!<br /><br />Like I told you before, you&#39;re doing a fantastic job with this suplement. In Lands of the Deads, when the Last Breath roll fails, you&#39;re just beginning a new journey.<br /><br />I doesn&#39;t matter if you&#39;re planning a KS Project, selling on RPGDrivethru, or just giving us for free (well, I&#39;d make a donation, for god sake!).<br /><br />You have my axe! </p>

        <p>Looks cool!  Back when I was playing Dragonquest I was working on a campaign setting called Blood Moon that was my last ditch attempt to cram in all the diverse elements I wanted to experience. Post-apocalyptic fantasy in a world infested with undead, demons and elemental-punk emergent technology with an Old West feel to it. I have some playwer test driving it now, but I really need to flesh it out some more. Your stuff is inspiring. <a href="https://bloodmoon.obsidianportal.com/wikis/main-page" class="ot-anchor">https://bloodmoon.obsidianportal.com/wikis/main-page</a></p>

        <p>I largely cannibalize for inspiration unless the setting&#39;s all of a piece. To that extent, fronts, and their dangers, and their linked moves, are all a lot of use to me. Everything else not so much.</p>
