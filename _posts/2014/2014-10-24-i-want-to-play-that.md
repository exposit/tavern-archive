        <p>There are multiple ways to do that, depending on how you want the focus to be.</p>

        <p>I like that kind of cinematic approach. <br />I like quick, lethal warriors, lightly armored, who attack in a whirlwind of spells and acrobatic stunts. <br />I&#39;m probably not looking at a Wizard grimoire here, no &quot;utility&quot; spells. <br /><br />In D&amp;D 4th the nearer thing was the Swordmage, and in Dungeon World I pulled something like that out multiclassing an Elf Warrior into Bard and Wizard, and working a lot on fictional positioning and world details and aspects.</p>

        <p>Good, but with too many non fighting/informative moves and not enough on the &quot;a flur of magic and steel&quot; side ^^</p>

        <p>Turns out, that concept is actually hard to do since this class wants to be good at so many things. I could do a great take on the SoM character but actual swordmage isn&#39;t as easy since you would need to go into 3 different archetypes to make it good. <br />You could however just take 2 classes that make you really good at fighting and then take spellcasting in addition. <br />That works. But I am not sure if that is what you are looking for. <br /><br />I could see taking the Arsenal class and reflavouring the arsenal as your spellbook/bag of trinkets. Than you could maybe do some neat things. <br />But Superawesome Swordmage - to broad of a concept in a way. <br /><br />The freedom of specialties however would allow me to retry making a Swordmage specialty again - something that I couldn&#39;t get to work as a CC. Not sure if that is a great idea though. </p>
