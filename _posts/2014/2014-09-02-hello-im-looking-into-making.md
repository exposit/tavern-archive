Hello, I&#39;m looking into making a class and would like some advice and or guidance on it; the basic premise is a blacksmith. Â

        <p>What is a blacksmith doing in a dungeon?<br />(This is not a sarcastic question)</p>

        <p>Plenty of classes up here in the tavern community &amp; in drivethrurpg to look at for examples. Good luck!</p>

        <p>Blacksmith seems too prescriptive and specific for a &quot;class&quot; per se and I think you&#39;ll have trouble making up enough moves to comprise a full class that are blacksmith specific? <br /><br />If you broaden your proposed class to be Artificer or Engineer as an example, and theme it along the lines of:<br /><br />- Taking bonuses and skills from the environment and enemies,<br />- Breaking magic items and equipment you find, <br />- Remaking them into something more useful.<br /><br />I think you get a broader, but perhaps easier to develop, idea.<br /><br />I recently read the Battlemind class suggestion by Sage La Torra at:<br /><br /><a href="http://www.latorra.org/2012/07/10/the-battlemind/" class="ot-anchor">http://www.latorra.org/2012/07/10/the-battlemind/</a><br /><br />and I liked the &#39;move currency&#39; it has with the Oneness move. <br /><br />You could do something here with a making type class where you have a currency for your moves to break and make things: you&#39;d earn currency when you break the environment/equipment/monsters, and spend it when you create new items.<br /><br />You could have moves that would allow you to &#39;collect&#39; tags and reuse them later in new items. So, perhaps you&#39;d collected the tags forceful, messy, long ... You could spend three of your move currency and combine it with 2 uses of adventuring equipment and make a:<br /><br /><b>Bomb</b> Messy, Forceful, Long<br /><br />Anyway, to bring us full circle, you could have a basic/advanced move sequence that was a blacksmith theme that allowed you to create weapons with your stolen moves and put the above in a sword or axe.<br /><br />There would have to be some careful testing to ensure you didn&#39;t overpower. Just a few thoughts.<br /><br /></p>

        <p>First thought - look at the Savvyhead in AW for inspiration on a workshop.</p>

        <p>Are you looking at making a base class or compendium class?</p>
