Is there any benefit to the game by adding crits on a 12 and fumbles on a roll of 2?  My group is coming off of DnDNext and they love crits and fumbles.  Curious how this element would affect game play.

        <p>Some moves I have seen do this already if you roll a 12 (some extra effect). I don&#39;t think a fumble on a 2 makes sense though because failure here already gives the GM leeway to do a lot of moves. Fumbles make other games more interesting where a miss is just a whiff and breaks up the monotony of hit/miss, hit/miss and I don&#39;t see that much with DW because of the variety of options a GM has on a failure.</p>

        <p>There&#39;s nothing stopping you from making as hard a move as you want on a 6-, if you want to save your truly devious stuff for the snake eyes, that&#39;s your choice.  A critical hit for box cars is a little trickier.  There is nothing in the rules for it, but home brewing some sort of critical success would be easy.  <br /><br />Take a look at Apocalypse World (the game Dungeon World is based on).  That game has a set of &#39;advanced moves players can get that emulate high crit actions.  Maybe you can use those to base your stuff off of.</p>

        <p>You could create custom moves to do this, although the best way to handle it might be to restrict this 12 or 2 behavior to specific moves, such as:<br /><br />CRITICAL STRIKE<br />When you Hack and Slash and score a 12+, roll two damage dice and use the better value.<br /><br />CRITICAL FUMBLE<br />When you Hack and Slash and score a 2, choose 1:<br />* You drop your weapon<br />* Your enemy inflicts maximum damage against you<br />* Put yourself in danger and take -1 forward</p>

        <p>You&#39;ve already got fumbles on a 6-, basically. <br /><br />And getting a 12+, not just boxcars, basically means a critical hit. Only it takes a bit to get moves to capitalize on that and they&#39;re only certain classes. <br /><br />Generally if you&#39;re making custom or otherwise one-off moves for a location or front, it&#39;s worth considering what happens on a 12+.</p>

        <p>12+ in Apocalypse World gets you &quot;Advanced Move&quot; results, but only if you&#39;ve advanced the character enough to have Advanced Moves. A similar logic works in DW for certain moves, but there&#39;s no reason not to have crits earlier if you want.<br /><br />I often vary the &quot;hardness&quot; of my GM moves based on just how low a failed roll is, which gives a bit more &quot;levels of success&quot; granularity. If they roll snake-eyes it can totally be an excuse to make a really hard move, and it&#39;s actually already fair to do so under the rules.</p>

        <p>An alternate rule that I&#39;m using in the setting myself and <span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink" href="https://plus.google.com/108125163619908291997" oid="108125163619908291997">Jacob Zimmerman</a></span>  are working on is &quot;Miracles on a 12&quot;. The world we&#39;re making is heavily saturated with magic and people can manipulate it, but on a minuscule scale. Basically the magic in the air is charged with energy and needs an excuse to let loose. When a hero rolls a nat 12 they tap into all that stored energy and a miracle happens. This gives the PC a huge boon that manifests itself with one hell of a special effects budget. We don&#39;t have any hard rules for this yet, but this is something we&#39;re doing for our world. In a more generic fantasy game I&#39;d maybe just describe the awesomeness as being an 11.</p>

        <p>Well, characters become fairly competent quite quickly... so a 2 is what a Master need to make those pesky players suffer... men, 2 HAVE to be a fracking failure! :D</p>

        <p>The Pit Fighter triggers his signature move or a combo on 12+. The idea was based on crits in other systems.</p>
