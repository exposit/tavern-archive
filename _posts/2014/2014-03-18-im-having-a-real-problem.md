I&#39;m having a real problem GMing Bonds and my PCs are having a bit of a problem as well. I get what they are meant for but well some of them are quite vague as bonds especially the bards ive noticed that its difficult for the players and me to know whether they have been completed or just strengthened.  <br /><br />Ill give an example the bard has a bond with the fighter I am singing songs of his adventures. How would you actually solve that?

        <p>as soon as that&#39;s not the most important thing that bonds the bard to the fighter! A bunch of good reasons: because... you stopped singing songs about him, you started writing poems about him, you sang all the songs about him and now it&#39;s time to move on about different subjects, you hate him, you fell in love with him, you lost your voice and cannot sing ever again, you discovered the fighter is an unworthy coward, because you had a funny breakfast together and suddenly that&#39;s the most important thing bonding you two.</p>

        <p>Great suggestions, <span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink" href="https://plus.google.com/106679386179477817028" oid="106679386179477817028">Alessandro Gianni</a></span> . I find bonds very interesting, though at times a bit hard to handle it. Lateral thinking is the way.</p>

        <p>Not to sound unhelpful, but the Bonds are a bit vague for a reason. It&#39;s up to the players involved to figure out the specifics.</p>

        <p>Hmm yeah I get that and some bonds have had the sweet spot of the players making interesting relationships of it and them being able to complete it. While these neither me or the players kind of know what to do with them. </p>

        <p>To quote from the book: &quot;A bond is resolved when it no longer describes how you relate to that person.&quot; So a Bond doesn&#39;t have to be completed, it simply has to no longer apply. It&#39;s a way to encourage character growth.<br /><br />As other people have said, there are any number of reasons why the Bard would stop singing songs about the Fighter.</p>
