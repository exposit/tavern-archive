We&#39;ve got a monthly rpg group running where I work, and next session we&#39;re planning to switch over from D&amp;D Next to DW. One of the players is a Barbarian right now and I&#39;m looking some options for a replacement class for him. Options on the table right now are The Brute and The Barbarian. I both are pretty awesome.<br /><br />But I was hoping for something with the idea of &quot;raging&quot; as central to the character&#39;s story, so I put together &quot;The Savage.&quot;  The savage has a little monster blood in its family tree that tends to cause some anger issues.<br /><br />Any feedback positive or negative you could provide would be much appreciated.<br /><br />Thanks!

        <p>I like the looks of it. Perhaps the 10+ Rage result might be a bit too powerful, given the utility of the various Furious Moves. Perhaps just 1 Fury without debility on 10+, and 1 Fury and one debility on 7-9?<br />And if that makes it not enough Fury, maybe offering an option to turn earned XP into Fury (but not vice-versa) instead?<br /><br />Granted, I haven&#39;t seen the Brute playbook, and can&#39;t really remember the Barbarian moves...</p>

        <p>Have you seen the Warrior from Grim Portents #1? It might be what you&#39;re looking for. Here&#39;s the playbook with a few of my tweaks.<br /><br /><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BwbHes6iNuGrd0hjUVBEbHhRSDQ/edit?usp=sharing" class="ot-anchor">https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BwbHes6iNuGrd0hjUVBEbHhRSDQ/edit?usp=sharing</a></p>

That fits great with what I was looking for. And now that you mention it, I remember seeing that when I first read Grim Portents a while ago. Looks like I subliminally stole a lot of its ideas.</p>

        <p>I just uploaded a new version of this with a few tweaks I made over the weekend.<br /><br />I&#39;m still debating about the Fury/Rage balance. <span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink" href="https://plus.google.com/114463285882634100096" oid="114463285882634100096">Michael Wight</a></span> I like the idea about trading in XP for fury, and I think it could make sense within the fiction, too. I tried to make the furious moves on par with the Fighter&#39;s Signature Weapon move as far as power, so I&#39;m not as concerned about granting 3 fury for a success. Because of the constant risk of a debility and/or failure I think it will balance out with the benefits of full success.<br /><br />One idea I&#39;m toying with: *On a 10+ choose 1<br /> - Hold 2 fury.<br /> - Hold 3 fury and take one debility.</p>
