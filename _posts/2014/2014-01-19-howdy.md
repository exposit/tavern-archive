Howdy. I&#39;ve been running DW for a while now, and find that it takes longer than I&#39;d like to stat up monsters on the fly.  If a fight breaks out, I need to know their HP, armor, and damage (with tags).  Unfortunately, that info is spread out through the monster questionnaire.<br /><br />Here&#39;s a monster-creation cheat sheet that reorganizes the questionnaire to get you those key numbers. If you&#39;ve got more time, you can also use the last column to figure out the monster&#39;s tags, moves, and qualities.<br /><br />I find it much faster to use.

        <p>This is very useful, I made a random monster generator based on these tables you may find useful <br /><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B87APnl6XAumQkpNckJVcEtUc1E/edit?usp=sharing" class="ot-anchor">https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B87APnl6XAumQkpNckJVcEtUc1E/edit?usp=sharing</a><br /><br />You need to enable macro to make it work and sometimes the results are a bit strange but I have kick off some interesting games with the results.</p>
