Had a great session last night - found myself doing something occasionally that I wanted to get feedback on. Every now and then in a fight, I would make a monster move on a 10+ roll. I didn&#39;t identify it as such, but I felt like it helped a lot to keep things moving. It seemed to follow the fiction and everyone was happy with how the fights flowed.<br /><br />For example <br /><br />Ranger (bow was knocked out of her hand): I grab a sharp rock and fling it at the Goblin Orkaster as  hard as I can while he goes after the fighter.  <br />GM: OK, let&#39;s call that a volley. Roll for it<br />Ranger: 11+2! I throw the rock so hard it&#39;s just a blur through the cave, dead on target.<br />GM: Roll damage<br />Ranger: 6 damage! <br />GM: Your stone hits the Orkaster square in the forehead with a sickening crunch. The force of the blow knocks into him with terrible force, knocking his head back.<br />(Orkaster&#39;s HP is at 1 at this point)<br />Party: Yeah!<br />GM: He staggers back and and you hear him scream an  incantation - fire seems to pour out of his hands, turning the goblins closest to him into ash. Cleric and Wizard, you guys are close to him - a wall of fire is filling the cave near the Orkaster headed right towards you - what do you do?<br /><br />----<br /><br />In that situation I was making a monster move after a 10+ roll. It seemed to flow naturally - maybe the moment post-throw was a golden opportunity? I am wondering how you guys read this.

        <p>From how you typed it, it looks like they were looking to you, so golden opportunity. You&#39;re good!</p>

        <p>Yup. I completely agree with <span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink" href="https://plus.google.com/102768177673605279668" oid="102768177673605279668">Giovanni Lanza</a></span>. Seems like the 10+ result from the Ranger&#39;s Volley move  had been resolved and the players were now looking to you to see what happened next. It was your turn in the conversation, and you made a move.</p>

        <p>Same as the previous posts, you&#39;re just keeping the narrative going.  The players should constantly be reacting to you.  Imagine a theoretical situation where all players constantly roll 10+ for everything.  If you don&#39;t make moves to drive the fiction, things just stop happening.</p>

        <p>if the players don&#39;t trigger their moves, then it&#39;s time for a gm move!</p>

        <p>And in this case, you weren&#39;t making a <b>hard</b> move, you were making a soft (setup) move.  Totally legit.  Expected, even. </p>

        <p>Yes. This example is exactly how you are supposed to do it. </p>

        <p>Thanks for the feedback, everyone! For me the toughest part of GMing is keeping the pace going and making sure I keep the players pointed towards action. This seemed to really help in fights. </p>

        <p>Heck, even if people weren&#39;t waiting for you to say something, I&#39;d say that you did the right thing. As you said, you kept the combat interesting, and every so often things should happen (IMHO) to shake things up a bit.</p>

        <p>they should constantly. Who wants a combat with no surprise and new situations? </p>

        <p>My first time running an AW-based game (and the first time any of us had played) went horribly. I didn&#39;t give the players/characters anything to react to, and so they didn&#39;t make moves. It was a terrible death spiral that ended in complete failure.<br /><br />But I learned my lesson.</p>

        <p>I think &quot;terrible death spiral that ends in complete failure&quot; is my new bottom grade description when I have to rank something.</p>
