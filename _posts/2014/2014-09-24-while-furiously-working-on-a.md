While furiously working on a new class, I had a spontaneous idea...<br /><br /><b>Chance&#39;s Coin</b><br />A thick, wide coin of unknown and unremarkable metal, stamped with a passive face in profile on each side. When you flip the coin, roll. * On a 7+, gain +1 forward and the faces smile pleasantly. * On a 10+, you gain an additional benefit of the GM&#39;s choice. * On a 6-, the faces laugh cruelly and the GM will tell you what happens. When you flip the coin again, if the previous result was a success, roll+1, otherwise roll-1. Eventually on a 6-, the coin will disappear. When you lose or give away the coin, the faces are passive again.﻿

        <p>Well it&#39;s extremely rough; but it&#39;s basically something among the lines of an advocate of chaos, or someone that lives sublimed to chaos.<br />If you&#39;ve ever played MTG, there&#39;s a certain red philosphy that describes the idea quite well. If you haven&#39;t, there are many creatures/spells in that game, in that color, that depend on coinflipping. They&#39;re usually high-risk high-reward cards.<br />I want to clarify (since usually in RPGs people make the mistake) that when I mean chaos I do not tie it more to evil than I do to good.</p>
