Ideas for custom Dungeon World moves, inspired by today&#39;s session:<br /><br />1. When you try to describe something and it&#39;s not only the GM who has no idea what you&#39;re trying to do, roll+WUT<br /><br />2. When you ask the GM a question, or propose a move when he hasn&#39;t had a chance to answer the previous player or resolve the previous action, roll+KANYE<br /><br />3. When you start your move with &quot;BEFORE THAT HAPPENS&quot;, roll+NOPE

        <p>I sometimes allow the &quot;Before that happens&quot; thing. But only if its coming from a player who hasn&#39;t gotten much action in recently.</p>

        <p>These might not be the best things, but they are a good sign that you are doing something right, because the players sure are excited to do things.</p>
