Reading the preview of <i>Inglorious</i>, <i>Dungeon World</i>&#39;s mass combat system, has me wondering about an easy mod for use in <i>Sixth World</i>.Â <br /><br />Now, mass fielded battles obviously aren&#39;t something you&#39;d expect from urban Shadowrunners, but I&#39;ve been merging Sixth World with the <i>Feng Shui</i> setting and thus can see some good fun in mass battles of PCs and friends vs other factions over power sites at various points in history as part of the Shadow War.<br /><br />I&#39;m wondering what moves/stats for a unit of hackers or a bike gang of riggers might look like.
