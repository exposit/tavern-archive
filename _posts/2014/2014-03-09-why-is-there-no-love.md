        <p>Because dragons wanted all the d12s for them. And when dragons say so... Either you&#39;re the holy avenger-wielding paladin, or shut up and suck it!</p>

        <p>Don&#39;t forget Paladins and their holy artifacts. <br /><br />It comes down to the scaling issues of the game, and the fact that the damage is centered around d6/d8/d10 based on the type of creature grouping, with modifiers based on numbers. If you follow a standard bell curve d4 and d12 damage are at either side of the potential damages available, with d6-d10 being what 98% of everything you run into doing. In the case of a group of d6 creatures that mob, you&#39;ll be adding bonuses to damage for those that all hit so, that d6 actually probably ends up as a d6+(2-4), while the d8 becomes d8+(1-2). </p>

        <p>Ancient solitary creatures can use d12s, provided they don&#39;t have anything else that lowers their damage die.</p>

        <p>Jason Paul; I&quot;m afraid I don&#39;t follow your comment at all. What does grouping of creatures have to do with whether D12 are used or not?</p>

That&#39;s only the base though. There are other factors that increase damage.<br /><br />Page 224 of the book explains the damage and HP that monsters do in groupings.  This is the norm for how damage is scaled for the majority of the game. Using a d4 lowers this (although d4s are reserved mostly for spells or additional damage rather than base damage). Using a d12 increases this. Mapped against a standard bell curve, these are the upper and lower limits of the dice that are used. They&#39;re not likely to be used at all, except in extreme cases.<br /><br />Page 22 explains what happens when multiple creatures are attacking at the same time. And this modifies the dice roll damage. Just because a solitary creature is encountered doesn&#39;t mean that it&#39;s going to be the only thing that you&#39;re dealing with during a fray. You might find a solitary creature being on the same side temporarily as a small group of other creatures all attacking the players, so the grouping can be in effect then and raise the eventual damage dealt.</p>
