Now that Christmas is said and done, I&#39;ve got a couple of things in need of discerning critique.<br /><br />The first is <i>The Psion</i>, a <i>Dungeon World</i> playbook that focuses on telekinesis and telepathy. Think the D&amp;D psion (4E, of course), just without shaper disciplines (though, the shaper could be another playbook entirely).<br /><br />The second is a simplified dungeon crawl game, more aimed at kids in terms of simplicity, which I talked about here: <br /><a href="http://daegames.blogspot.com/2014/12/playtesting-really-simple-dungeon-crawl.html" class="ot-anchor">http://daegames.blogspot.com/2014/12/playtesting-really-simple-dungeon-crawl.html</a><br /><br />If either or both of these things is of interest to you, lemme know! Everyone that provides decent feedback gets their name in the Special Thanks and (more importantly) a free pdf when they&#39;re done!<br /><br />(Also, feel free to share and spread the word to potentially interested parties.)<br /><br /> <a rel="nofollow" class="ot-hashtag" href="https://plus.google.com/s/%23dungeonworld/posts">#dungeonworld</a>   <a rel="nofollow" class="ot-hashtag" href="https://plus.google.com/s/%23roleplayinggames/posts">#roleplayinggames</a>

        <p>is this Psion any different than the one that we gave feedback on awhile back?</p>
