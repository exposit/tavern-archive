        <p>Would you look at that, mimic is not in the book...<br /><br />Here is a barebones block, sans flavor text: <br /><br /><b>MIMIC</b> <i>Solitary, Intelligent, Amorphous, Hoarder, Stealthy</i><br />Bite (d10 damage 1 piercing) 15 HP 1 Armor<br />Close<br /><b>Special Qualities:</b> Shape change<br /><i>Instinct:</i> To assume the shape of furniture<br />* Tempt with treasure<br />* Attack suddenly</p>
