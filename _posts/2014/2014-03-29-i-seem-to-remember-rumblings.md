I seem to remember rumblings a while back about mass combat. I&#39;m thinking it was connected with the DW KS campaign. Can someone point me in the right direction here? Is there another supplement or sourcebook that handles larger units of battle beyond the party?

        <p><b>Inglorious</b>, and its not &#39;out&#39; yet. The playtest is available sans art, and we&#39;ve been using it to great success, especially since we&#39;ve had a regular &#39;Domain&#39; style epic campaign being run at our annual camping trip on the beach for the last 5 years or so. It includes some evocative CC for your military style campaign leaders and rough notes on steadings as characters.<br />I&#39;m sure <span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink" href="https://plus.google.com/117415966179711277938" oid="117415966179711277938">Sage LaTorra</a></span> or <span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink" href="https://plus.google.com/112484087750169360510" oid="112484087750169360510">Adam Koebel</a></span> could say yay or nay if you would like the link/file.</p>

        <p>Thanks, I actually managed to get the right magical combination of google search terms and found a recent interview regarding the project and DW in general. <a href="http://briecs.blogspot.com/2014/03/five-or-so-adam-koebel.html" class="ot-anchor">http://briecs.blogspot.com/2014/03/five-or-so-adam-koebel.html</a><br /><br />Thanks for the quick feedback. I sadly missed out on the KS so I rely on this community and random posts on reddit to keep me updated.</p>

        <p>From what I understand, anyone can gain access to upcoming supplements by posting their thoughts about the game, via the Adventurer&#39;s Guild. <a href="http://www.dungeon-world.com/the-adventurers-guild/" class="ot-anchor">http://www.dungeon-world.com/the-adventurers-guild/</a></p>
