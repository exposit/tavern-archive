        <p>The power of internet memes has warped your sense of reality.  That which would otherwise horrify &amp; disgust you is now desireable &amp; mesmerizing.</p>

        <p>-They don&#39;t scream in terror and spat it for 1d3 damage<br />-They reluctantly pet it, keeping their eyes on it all the while<br />-They do anything not to be kept in its presence, but are to polite to show it</p>

        <p>Depends on the world/setting, some races like the drow (dark elf), gnomes or dwarves might use the larger ones like we would use dogs for odd jobs (as well as spiders great for silk production).</p>

        <p>I&#39;d use some of the moves from Jim Hines&#39; <i>Goblin Quest</i> for this, really. The spider was one of the most important characters in that book.</p>

        <p>Not sure if it is suppose to be a good or bad list even if the spider is &#39;adorable&#39;, but I would go with some of these random options:<br />-The person faints and you can rob them.<br />-They start to panic, you get + 1 forward to parley with them through intimidation.<br />-They respect your love for spiders and tell you a rumor.<br />-They run scared  and drop something.</p>

        <p>Jumping spiders are awesome. They&#39;re also <i>really</i> small (as that image demonstrates). Watching them go about their business is fascinating.<br /><br />I watched a doco many years ago now on one type that only hunted other spiders. Many of these were much larger than them, which is not surprising given their size. This particular type was incredibly intelligent and creative.<br /><br />This reply was brought to you by a 7–9 on Spout Lore. It&#39;s on you to make it useful.</p>
