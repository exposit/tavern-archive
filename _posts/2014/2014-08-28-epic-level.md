EPIC LEVEL! DUNGEON WORLD! YEAH!<br /><br />I haven&#39;t made use of any of these moves, but I had a spare 15 minutes and wanted to mess around with the idea.<br /><br />Feel free to take any of these for your game. Here&#39;s one of them:<br /><br /><b>Witchfinder, Demonslayer</b><br />When you kill someone in the presence of their loved ones or peers, roll+CHA. <br />On a 10+, choose two. <br />On a 7-9, choose one.<br />- Convince them of the deceased’s guilt, whether true or fabricated.<br />- They back-down, stand in shock or flee, for now.<br />- Gain an ally, their long held grudge revealed.<br />- Rumour spreads to nearby steadings that you slayed a villain most foul.

        <p>I think it might be interested to see some Exalted playbooks with moves that just presume that power level.</p>

        <p>Overall I really like these ridiculous moves and their epic scope. I think the idea of a Demigod World would be a fun change of pace. Here are a few nit picks I found.<br /><br />Diplomatic Immunity: The idea of a move giving three hold and that&#39;s it seems odd. Yes you wrote in that the player could earn more but you didn&#39;t say how. Moves that you can only use X number of times and that&#39;s it seems like a less desirable choice than moves you can use forever. I think this could be a good pick 2/1 move that triggers whenever the player is accused of a crime.<br /><br />Beast Mode: Does the player go back to rolling their Last Breath afterwords?<br /><br />Bring the Thunder: Why STR? This feels like a WIS or CHA move. Though if this was going to a Thunder God class then I could see this going to STR, just by itself it seems odd.<br /><br />Bed of Chaos: F_____G AWESOME!<br /><br />STOP: Are the players free to do whatever they want? This seems like an I win button. Granted the lack of modifier can make it less reliable, but a 10+ sounds like an auto win in a fight. It should probably have some sort of restriction like, &quot;Time stays still until someone in your group rolls a move. They gain +1 forward on that move.&quot;<br /><br />The Terrifying Arc: Why STR? Feels like a DEX move. Most/All archers are going to be DEX based. Why not cater to them?<br /><br />Betwixtomancer: This move has the same problems as Bend Bars, Lift Gates. It offers a few things you can do, but then the GM needs to look at the list to figure out what did go wrong. Instead make it: On a 10+ choose 1, on a 7-9 choose 2<br />   Your passage takes a while<br />   The opening you made stays open and others can use it<br />   Someone who came with got lost on the way<br />   You attract unwanted attention<br />Now the GM knows exactly how to mess with you.<br /><br />I am the night: Should have a requirement of doing Bale&#39;s &quot;Batman Voice&quot;.<br /><br />Aura of Power: It&#39;s on there twice.<br /><br />Just as Planned: What&#39;s the modifier for this?<br /><br />This idea of crazy epic moves is great and I think these will be fun to put into my game once my players get to this level. You did an awesome job with these. Thanks for writing them.</p>

Thank you for the reply. They&#39;re just rough ideas, so thank you for your input.<br /><br />Diplomatic Immunity: It might be less desirable, could even just be a bad move! I figured with the right devious mind getting away with three crimes might be enough.<br /><br />Beast Mode: I&#39;ve altered the wording some so it is clearer, after you slay/neutralise whatever thing killed you, you then take your Last Breath.<br /><br />Bring the Thunder: I had someone who plays a barbarian in mind for this, so I went the heavy metal route and choose STR. Hack the move for WIS or CHA if need be.<br /><br />Bed of Chaos: <b>It is.</b><br /><br />Stop: Is broken. Don&#39;t give anyone Stop. Your version is way better!<br /><br />The Terrifying Arc: It&#39;s a STR move for a ranger or fighter that values Strength. The fiction of the move comes first, and gives an archer another option to keep shooting arrows interesting. Its basically the &quot;I want to be the giant archer from that one Game of Thrones episode or Hawkeye Gough from Dark Souls&quot; move.<br /><br />Betwixtomancer: Yeah, thats likely a better wording for it.<br /><br />I am the Night: Unwritten but mandatory.<br /><br />Aura of Power: Fixed.<br /><br />Just as Planned: Fixed. It&#39;s INT.<br /><br />You&#39;re welcome!</p>

        <p>Remembrance: I&#39;d reduce the time needed. Also, putting a roll (+Wis?) to get 1 or 3 holds, druid style. So, interesting things could happen with a failure.</p>

        <p>Shoot First: what about ambushes? Also, I think the extra d4 is forward, right?</p>

        <p>I was working at a similar document, about the life after the 10th level. I have ideas but few time these days (also, low writing skills in English...). Surely I&#39;d work with your moves to find my perfect blend. <br />I was thinking about different kind of advancements (always in form of moves, so you can get them just one time):<br />- a move to get a permanent boost to HPs <br />- a move to get a special move linked to your best Ability (ie. If I have 18 Strength, I get epic Strength, letting me try superhuman tests, in form of specialized defying danger) <br />- a move get a superhuman feature, something like holy aura, rock-like skin etc. <br />- a move to get tons of &quot;equip&quot;, like a castle, or a squad of Knights, or a luxury brothel etc. <br />Also, I&#39;d change the end of session questions with something braver, bolder. <br /><br />Ps: kudos for all that Dark Souls related stuff :D</p>

        <p>I have a problem with My Final Form. It just begs for it to be a Greater Apostheosis of some kind.</p>
