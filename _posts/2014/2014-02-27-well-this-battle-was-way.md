Well, this battle was way too easy, which I should be happy about, having nearly killed them in every room up until this.

        <p>Do you prefer to use miniatures with DW? Â It seems to me that it would impede the fiction to use them, but I haven&#39;t tried.</p>

        <p>It&#39;s a bit clunky sometimes, and I prefer to play without them, but I&#39;m using them because the workmates enjoy them.</p>

        <p>I was against them until recently when I was running a game and a friend brought them out and placed them on the map we were drawing. As long as you aren&#39;t measuring inches and movements, I think that they are perfectly fine and helpful as far as keeping straight where people and enemies are.Â </p>

        <p>Rule of thumb for us is Hand is 1 square, Reach is 2, Near is 4 and Far is 8.</p>

        <p>i think &quot;use what helps you most and doesn&#39;t fight the agenda/principles&quot; is the right answer.Â </p>

        <p>I think the biggest struggle I have had converting 4e tactical scenarios to DW is the pacing. If I have every creature come out and attack at once, everyone almost dies. If I stagger them and use more soft moves, the heroes (of whom I am a fan) thrash everything with barely a scratch. I&#39;ll figure it out one day.</p>

        <p>I prefer using mini&#39;s, but no longer use a hex map like I did in Dragonquest. Â <span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink" href="https://plus.google.com/105472060898626050077" oid="105472060898626050077">Matt Horam</a></span>Â I agree that getting the pacing right is Â a challenge in DW. I try to resist the urge to play many of the opponents as just killing machines, while killing the character is a plus (From their opponent&#39;s perspective), what do they gain with other actions against the characters? Kidnapping, ransom, sacrifice to their god, possible coercion Â to their cause are all possible monster moves. I really have to resist the temptation to kill a player in a vulnerable position because I know that is how they interact with most of the monsters.Â </p>

        <p>For my next session, I&#39;m using an assortment of ludo pieces as minis to give my players a rough idea of the fight, I can&#39;t wait to see if it works or not ðŸ˜ƒ</p>

        <p>An upside to use mini&#39;s is that it forces you to draw a map, and that helps you avoid the &quot;blank 30ft by 30ft room&quot; dilemma.</p>

        <p>I keep a spiral notebook and draw a map for whatever is going on. It is really fun to flip through it as our sessions go on to see where we&#39;ve been and what we&#39;ve done (as opposed to the dry erase board I was using previously).<br /><br />I use mini&#39;s on my maps but never for measuring distance which is always handled in the fiction. Our combats are so big and tactical I&#39;m not sure how we could get by without them =P.</p>
