        <p>Could there be a reason to have two signature weapons? I&#39;m trying to think of a character that carries two. <br /><br />For instance a sword and bow, or two blades. They could be the weapons of this persons father or something? <br /><br />Just some ideas.</p>

        <p>I can&#39;t really imagine taking the move unless it was available to me at first level.  &quot;Signature&quot; implies that it&#39;s part of your character concept.  If I pick up a new signature weapon during play, I want to pick it up <i>during play</i>, not just as an advance.<br /><br />It could work as a background/race move, I think.  Though I might limit it to just 1 extra weapon, not 2.</p>

        <p>I think 1 would be better but I could understand someone wanting a messier hammer and light rapier for different kinds of fights.</p>

        <p>Ugh.  I hated that Roy from Order of the Stick lost his signature weapon and had to carry around a makeshift club for a while.  In real life, it makes sense to diversify and have a few extra weapons you&#39;re good with in case your weapon breaks, is stolen, is getting blacksmith to awesomeness, etc... but I guess part of DW &quot;being a fan&quot; means don&#39;t mess with the signature weapon.</p>
