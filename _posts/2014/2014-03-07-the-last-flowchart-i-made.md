The last flowchart I made got a <i>lot</i> of response. Much of the response was motivated by the fact that I failed to convey the assumption made by the model.<br /><br />I made a new model (an even <i>simpler</i> one), but this time I&#39;m going to explain my assumptions.<br /><br />It is assumed that the players are already in a situation that requires immediate action. The flowchart doesn&#39;t explain how to <i>initialize</i> the game, just how to <i>keep it going</i> by explicitly telling the GM when different things happen.<br /><br />The box after the chart has been updated to indicate, where the main part of the conversation will be. The arrows out tells you when the conversation triggers response from either a player move or GM move.<br /><br />The &quot;resolve all moves&quot; box has a term called &quot;non-miss&quot;. This is means each move with a rolled hit, or each move that requires no roll. Also, it is assumed in this box that players can react in any way that makes sense before the final value of the roll has been calculated. I.e, you can spent a use from a <i>bag of books</i> in Dungeon World after you have seen your roll.<br /><br />I might make a further update to make the &quot;resolve moves&quot; part more explicit, perhaps giving it its own sub-chart.

Much of the response was motivated by the fact that I failed to convey the assumption made by the model.

I made a new model (an even simpler one), but this time I'm going to explain my assumptions.

It is assumed that the players are already in a situation that requires immediate action. The flowchart doesn't explain how to initialize the game, just how to keep it going by explicitly telling the GM when different things happen.

The box after the chart has been updated to indicate, where the main part of the conversation will be. The arrows out tells you when the conversation triggers response from either a player move or GM move.

The "resolve all moves" box has a term called "non-miss". This is means each move with a rolled hit, or each move that requires no roll. Also, it is assumed in this box that players can react in any way that makes sense before the final value of the roll has been calculated. I.e, you can spent a use from a bag of books in Dungeon World after you have seen your roll.

I might make a further update to make the "resolve moves" part more explicit, perhaps giving it its own sub-chart.</a>
