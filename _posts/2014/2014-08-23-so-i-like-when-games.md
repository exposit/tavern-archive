So I like when games have players choose negative aspects for their characters and then reward them when they use them against themselves. (Mouseguard and Burning Wheel come to mind) So I was thinking maybe in addition to alignments playbooks might also include misalignments. The idea here would be that if you intentionally fail a roll because failing satisfies your misalignment you get an xp at the end of session.

        <p>I&#39;ve always been interested in the idea since I saw it in a special playbook someone wrote (<a href="https://docs.google.com/file/d/0BxI2vfsw1haqQUhsdXZQZUVmZnM/edit?pli=1" class="ot-anchor">https://docs.google.com/file/d/0BxI2vfsw1haqQUhsdXZQZUVmZnM/edit?pli=1</a> - I can&#39;t remember who it was, though :&lt;). I&#39;m hoping someone might&#39;ve written some for the base classes and posts them here :D</p>
