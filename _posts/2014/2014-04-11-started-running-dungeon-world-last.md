Started running Dungeon World last week. I printed out the Barbarian to cater for a couple of players who appreciated it, but I&#39;ve got a query re. some of the moves:<br />The basic move &#39;Musclebound&#39; seems like it&#39;s duplicated by the advanced move &#39;Smash!&#39;, which reads to me like it&#39;s just a restriction of the &#39;messy&#39; tag.<br />Am I reading it wrong?<br />Thanks

        <p>There is an important, if subtle, difference between a weapon with the <i>messy</i> tag and <b>Smash!</b>: basically, with a <i>messy</i> weapon it&#39;s the GM who decides what the messy effects are: you tell them if they gouge an eye, or break a bone, or what. With <b>Smash!</b> it&#39;s their choice... Also, because you do it, <i>messy</i> is a sort of passive effect: when they damage an enemy, you weave that in your narration. <b>Smash!</b> is something they do, actively, so it&#39;s fun!</p>

        <p>Also, with <b>Smash!</b> they can also grab something the target wears or owns: the sigil ring (maybe with a bit of finger attached, but, well, you know...), the necklace with the Lich&#39;s phylactery, the guardsman&#39;s set of keys to the city prison, etc...</p>
