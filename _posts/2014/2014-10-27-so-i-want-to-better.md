So I want to better understand the start as a new class option for 10th level characters. Do they start leveling up as that class as a level one character? Do they still get ability points at each new level? I get the &quot;they keep their key moves&quot; thing, I&#39;m just confused about the rest of it.

        <p>The consensus is that they basically start as a level 1 for that class and don&#39;t increase abilities.</p>

        <p>start as level 1 for new class with ability increases at level 2+</p>

        <p>No ability increases.</p>

        <p>Eh, I&#39;ll just have to disagree there. I interpret &quot;keeping ability scores&quot; when you change class to not exclude raising abilities further as you level the new class. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s problematic as long as you aren&#39;t raising anything over 18. I mean, a wizard-turned-fighter will be pretty sorry indeed if they can&#39;t get stronger.</p>

        <p>You would only go into fighter of you already had good strength, wouldn&#39;t you? Maybe INT and STR at 18. Now you get to raise ALL your other stats as well.</p>

        <p>You still get Ability points according to the rules as written (i.e. it is not explicitly stated that you do not gain them any longer). Michael Snow is right from my POV.</p>
