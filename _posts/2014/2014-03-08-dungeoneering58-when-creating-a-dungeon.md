Dungeoneering:  When creating a dungeon are there any principles or fundamentals to consider before or during the creation process?  What are good things to keep in mind while making a dungeon to appeal to all the characters in the party, with regard to puzzles, mobs and mystery?

        <p>The most important thing to keep in mind? <b>Why</b> are the characters adventuring. What&#39;s their goal?</p>

        <p>I rarely add much detail beyond a general concept (sunken lizardfolk pyramid, shattered god-corpse, necropolis surrounded by a storm of wayward souls, etc), fleshing it out as the players explore, ask questions, and make moves. <br /><br />I find that, for me, it makes it easier to adjust various factors on the fly to meet the needs of the group.</p>

        <p>You should have a look at what the players are expecting by looking over their character sheets. The  classes and moves have they&#39;ve chosen will give you a good hint. But this is Dungeon World and you should rely on their answers to your questions to shape a dungeon that everybody will enjoy.</p>

        <p>This is my goto resource for making dungeons that rock. It is long and amazing (<a href="http://goo.gl/c6qTCz" class="ot-anchor">http://goo.gl/c6qTCz</a>).</p>
