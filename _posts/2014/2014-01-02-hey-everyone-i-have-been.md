Hey everyone, I have been working on a Kobold class, I got inspired by the elf dwarf and halfling classes and  I wanted to make some for the downtrodden races. I am also currently working on an Orc, and possibly a goblin or ratman class. Let me know what you think, its really only the first page.<br /><br />PS. Ignore the last page, very early draft.

        <p>The background choices are kind of off-kilter. An extra starting item and 20 gold isn&#39;t going to mean anything outside of a one-shot, and speaking another language is something that just kind of happens in DW.<br /><br />Maybe consider these?<br /><br /><b>Servant</b>: You are a servitor for some other powerful entity; describe it. You can use that entity&#39;s potential disapproval as leverage for Parley when appropriate.<br /><br /><b>Bandit</b>: Add the following to your list of trap effect options: they lose hold of a weapon or valuable object.</p>

        <p>I didn&#39;t post them to not be used, go nuts.<br /><br />As for the rest of it:<br /><br />I like the way you&#39;ve structured the equipment, <br /><br />Trap design is a little... eh. I can kind of get what you&#39;re going at here, but how are you intending them to be used? Like, set up the traps in advance, or rig a satchel charge, toss it, and press the detonator? That framing might suggest certain differences in how you&#39;d break down the 10+ versus 7-9 options. Maybe even have a base move that modifies how it gets used in combat?<br /><br />Anyway, on options for trapsmithing: <br /><br />- class damage +1d4; +1d6 is reserved for situations where you&#39;d be doing autodamage and this seems more like an &quot;attack roll&quot; kind of thing.<br />- &quot;it can be reused&quot; doesn&#39;t seem very beneficial when it doesn&#39;t cost a trapsmith anything to make the trap<br />- area damage seems pretty powerful for just a standard choice; maybe &quot;it affects 1d4 creatures in the blast radius&quot;?<br />- &quot;it puts them in a spot&quot; might be better left to your Dragon Power, as:<br />- Red: they catch on fire<br />- White: they&#39;re frozen in place<br />- Blue: they&#39;re momentarily stunned<br />- Black: they&#39;re sprayed with acid<br />- Green: they&#39;re blinded by mist</p>

        <p>Thanks for all the help! I will take all of this into consideration.</p>

        <p>Good start. It would be cool to further incorporate the dragon lineage into advanced moves, too. Like a 6-10 move &quot;Halitosis&quot; that lets you add your Draconic Lineage benefit to your breath weapon.</p>

        <p>Alex I probably need to word it better but that&#39;s what I was trying to do with bad breath. That way it would be used very differently for different kinds of kobolds</p>
