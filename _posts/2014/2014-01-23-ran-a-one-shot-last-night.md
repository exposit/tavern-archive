Ran a one-shot last night for a group that&#39;s never played DW before. It went really well; except for the cleric. I watched this guy roll 11 consecutive 6-. I think he must have angered his god! Or his god was really wanting him to level up...

        <p>No, but after his third horribly botched healing attempt the rest of the party started saying &quot;No, I&#39;m good.&quot; whenever he offered to heal them.<br /><br />At one point he said &quot;But I&#39;m the cleric!&quot; to which the bard replied &quot;I do not think that word means what you think it means!&quot;</p>

        <p>LOL that is horrible. Poor guy =P. Does he plan to return for more? Did any of them express interest in playing again?</p>

        <p>I&#39;ve had something similar happen to the warrior in my group. It kind of sucked the fun out of the evening. Come to think of it, we haven&#39;t played DW since.</p>

        <p>If failing isn&#39;t as interesting and fun as success you should probably re-assess how you are handling failures.</p>

        <p>I use those nights as a good time to let a 6- be &quot;success with a GM move.&quot; Yes, I make my move, but nothing in the rules says a 6- can&#39;t also mean the PC does something, it just costs a LOT.<br /><br />Example: healing. Ok, you don&#39;t lose the spell, because you use up your bandages instead, and the target regains 1 hp. Yeah, it&#39;s a bit soft, but by the time the PC has rolled his 5th 6-, I would be softening the consequences until I needed a more dramatic event to happen.</p>

        <p>I agree.  One of the core mechanics of * World is that every roll has a consequence. Every time someone fails a roll, something &quot;bad&quot; or, as Jason said, &quot;interesting&quot; is supposed to happen. Maybe not to the Cleric, but perhaps to someone else in the party.</p>

It was also 4 or 5 in a row at a critical juncture /and/ at the very end of the session. At some point I run out of cool ideas for how to handle failure. Improv isn&#39;t my strongest GM tool and sometimes running DW can be really hard.</p>

        <p>I agree with <span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink" href="https://plus.google.com/108429258070600840800" oid="108429258070600840800">Jason Morningstar</a></span> and <span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink" href="https://plus.google.com/105475894157985048710" oid="105475894157985048710">Rory MacLeod</a></span>. <br /><br />That&#39;s why I asked if someone died. If more than four failed roles happen in a row and someone hasn&#39;t died then I begin to wonder if I&#39;m tightening the screws enough.<br /><br />Whats frustrating about a failed roll in other games is the drop of fiction. <br />Player: &quot;I try to open the door&quot; *Rolls<br />GM: &quot;You don&#39;t open the door.&quot;<br /><br />DW is different...the player should almost feel like they didn&#39;t fail.<br />Player: &quot;I try to open the door.&quot; *Rolls &quot;Oh, shoot!&quot;<br />GM: &quot;Mark XP. As you get to work, goblins bust out of two other doors you hadn&#39;t previously seen, what do you do?&quot;<br /><br />All that said, kill a character. They&#39;ll thank you for it. Getting a new character in the game is easy as pie and your player may appreciate not having to be the cursed cleric anymore.</p>

        <p>If a 6- doesn&#39;t make at least someone at the table groan than your move probably aren&#39;t hard enough.</p>

        <p>Some also directly forbid you to have these &quot;nothing happens&quot; results and players can call GMs on it.</p>

        <p>They all had a blast! Most of them asked where to get a copy and the whole group was thinking that it would be great for those times they aren&#39;t playing their primary game (I think they are in the middle of a huge campaign). <br /><br />I was really impressed at how well they adopted to the DW paradigm and really start getting into it. The guy playing the thief loved the fact that he only made 1 or 2 attacks all night but did tons of awesome stuff. The dwarven fighter must have done 15 cool things with his axe, including a few actual attacks. Even our host, the guy playing the cleric, said it was awesome. Each hard move feeling like something significant was really happening. </p>
