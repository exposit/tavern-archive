Boordrum the Eyeless, architect of the spherical Kattatonian Palace, tested the magical principles that made that wonder of the world possible on smaller spheres. He considered them by-products of his work and threw them away, but they were salvaged and fetch a pretty penny on the street, where they’re commonly known as Boordrum’s Balls.<br /><br />Boordrum’s Shield<br />1 weight<br />An unusually heavy iron ball the size of a fist, scarred with thousands of cuts that form an intricate pattern across its surface. When you throw it into the air it hovers in a slow orbit around you at heart level. The orb blocks the next successful weapon attack (i.e. not claws, bites, spells etc.) against you, after which it falls to the ground.<br /><br />Boordrum’s Compass<br />0 weight<br />This orb of bright white stone is the size of an eyeball. When you think of something you want to find and throw the orb into the air it hovers at eye level, settling near you to indicate a direction. Roll+INT. * On a 10+ both. * On a 7-9 choose one:<br />• the orb shows you the safest way to the goal.<br />• the orb shows you the quickest way to the goal.<br /><br />Boordrum’s Wings<br />-1 weight<br />Two spheres of flawless, slightly blue tinted glass, these orbs have almost no weight at all. As long you hold one in each hand, you are completely weightless. As long as they’re on your person (in a pouch, backpack, etc.) your load is also lightened by 1.<br /><br />Feedback welcome! This feels like it&#39;ll become quite a large series of items over time – feel free to add your own. :-)

        <p>Thanks <span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink" href="https://plus.google.com/118274317738578754478" oid="118274317738578754478">Joseph Le May</a></span>! And yeah, the shield&#39;s definitely the one I&#39;m not so sure about. I&#39;m not sure it&#39;s too weak – removing one complete damage dealing attack against you per fight is kinda handy – but I don&#39;t feel that&#39;s it interesting enough. Any suggestions for improvement will be met with applause!</p>

        <p>Hmmmm...roll INT when you are struck while using it. On a 10+, it acts as Armor 3 that stacks with normal armor (it absorbs the brunt of the blow). <br />On a 7-9, same, but then it drops immediately to the ground. <br />On a 6-, in addition to any other effects, the Shield begins floating around your adversary.</p>

        <p><b>Boordrum’s Spellshield</b><br />Just as your shield, but absorbing spells instead of sword blows. Made of silvery transparent glass. Essence of the spell is trapped inside until it&#39;s purged away by the first rays of the morning sun. Only an empty shield can be used for absorbing spells.<br /><br /><b>Boordrum&#39;s Ram</b><br />2 weight<br />Perfectly round head-sized sphere of black marble. Rolled like a bowling bowl doesn&#39;t stop until it hits solid obstacle (wall, door, gate, rock...). No matter how slow the ball rolls the force of the impact is equal to two dozen battering ram blows.<br /><a href="https://www.google.cz/search?q=black+marble&amp;espv=2&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ghkGVIOIEu-v7Ab1xYCoDQ&amp;ved=0CAYQ_AUoAQ&amp;biw=1920&amp;bih=965" class="ot-anchor">https://www.google.cz/search?q=black+marble&amp;espv=2&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ghkGVIOIEu-v7Ab1xYCoDQ&amp;ved=0CAYQ_AUoAQ&amp;biw=1920&amp;bih=965</a><br /><br /><b>Boordrum&#39;s Bell</b><br />0 weight<br />Two eyeball-sized bronze orbs. Banged together they negate all sound in Near range for next ten minutes.<br /><br /><b>Boordrum&#39;s Feast Insurance</b><br />0 weight<br />Dice-sized pink pearl. Swallow it to gain the ability to eat anything - wood, rock, bone, poison, acid, obscene amounts of food and alcohol, anything. Downside is that you don&#39;t get any nourishment. Induce vomit to retrieve the pearl and eat normally.<br /><br />(sry for my english, not my native language)</p>

        <p>And another one...<br /><br />Boordrum&#39;s Bandage<br />0 weight<br />Soft, flesh coloured and strangely warm, when you place this fist sized sphere on a wound, it softens and spreads, closing the wound, removing 1 debility and healing 8 damage. Only the person who applied it can remove it, and when they do it causes 4 damage and the wound returns to its previous state. After each use the orb must be recharged by soaking it for an hour in 1 litre of humanoid blood, which it completely absorbs.</p>

        <p><b>Boordrum&#39;s Shield</b><br />I&#39;m imagining this floating sphere as blocking or deflecting metallic attacks, so what about this:<br /><br />As long as the sphere floats about you, you gain +1 armor. When you defy danger against a metallic weapon, take +1, and on a 12+ you deflect the attack into a close by creature of your choice.<br /><br />The GM could have a soft or hard move cause the sphere to get knocked away, requiring you to reset it. However, nothing stops an enemy from picking it up.<br /><br />Now, if the shield is intended to protect you from assassins, then you could say that it provides +1 armor, even against attacks that you cannot see. Not sure how to roll in a defy danger with this...thinking WIS might work if you don&#39;t see the attack coming.<br /><br />If you have mentally will the sphere to block things, you could also allow it to let you defy danger against weapons using INT.<br /><br />In any case I wouldn&#39;t give it a weight since it floats.<br /><br /><b>Boordrum&#39;s Compass</b><br />This one is basically fine, though another way to word it is &quot;On a 10+, it shows you the safest and quickest route.&quot;<br /><br />You could also roll in a benefit like, &quot;if you&#39;re undertaking a perilous journey, the trailblazer takes +1&quot; or &quot;if you&#39;re undertaking a perilous journey, if the trailblazer rolls a miss it instead counts as a 7-9&quot;.<br /><br />Another way of using this is to have it float or roll on the ground towards your destination.<br /><br /><b>Boordrum&#39;s Wings</b><br />Do you have to flap your arms to fly, or will something like a Superman pose work? Is the flight kind of clumsy, because then you could roll a DEX move into using this thing.</p>

        <p><b>Boordrum&#39;s Band</b><br />1 Weight<br />Fist-sized ball made up of various colorful materials (fabrics, woods, coral...) pressed together. Whenever anyone in it&#39;s presence starts singing, the ball lifts up to levitate one meter above ground and emits sounds to provide whatever instrumental background the singer&#39;s song might require (drums, lute, violin, flute, hundred clapping hands…)<br /><br /><b>Boordrum’s Gathering Balls</b><br />0 Weight<br />Little candy-sized stone spheres. There is a dozen of them. When you remove one (or more) from the set and place it on a ground, it will slowly roll in the direction of the biggest gathering of its friends back to the set.<br /><br /><b>Boordrum’s Shreder</b><br />1 Weight<br />Fist-sized sphere of matt, blocky, grey metal. When hurled with a reasonable force it will shatter into a hundred small shrapnel fragments that will damage everything in Reach range of the impact. Few seconds later the fragments pull themselves together back to the sphere shape.<br /><br /><br />Feel free to add Dungeon World mechanics and ignore my horrible english :)</p>

I&#39;m still not sure about the <b>Shield</b>, but that&#39;s food for thought. And I like the idea of the <b>Compass</b> rolling and improving perilous journey rolls. As for the <b>Wings</b>, the idea isn&#39;t flight, it&#39;s true weightlessness, like being in space. So you could use it to ascend or descend a cliff, cross a room without touching the floor, etc, but you&#39;ll need to push off of something and judge speed and trajectory just right. But adding a roll+DEX move makes sense, not to operate the ball, but simply to get to where you want without problems. Maybe something like:<br />* On a 10+ all 3. * a on 7-9 choose 2:<br />- you float to exactly where you wanted to.<br />- you float at exactly the desired speed.<br />- you don&#39;t take 1d4 damage from bashing into things.﻿<br /><br />I also had an additional idea for the <b>Compass</b>: when your press both balls against an object, that object is weightless.</p>
