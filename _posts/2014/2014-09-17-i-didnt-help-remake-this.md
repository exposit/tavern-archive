I didn&#39;t help remake this one, BUT I did help him come up with a way to design the character sheet. I got so giddy when I came up with using the staff and music notes that I was flailing my arms and shouting, &quot;I got it! I got it!&quot; (I&#39;m a big band geek.)<br /><br />Now having played the original DW Bard to level 7 I must say that there were times I felt pretty useless, or the idea that I needed to pull out my flute and play something real quick in the middle of battle that just didn&#39;t fit in my mind. It was a fun campaign, but not until I hit level 6 did I feel really useful. As a person who&#39;s played various musical instruments I just can&#39;t imagine playing something while a skeleton comes rushing at me.  <br /><br />From what I can see of <span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink" href="https://plus.google.com/117134143142507309944" oid="117134143142507309944">David Guyll</a></span>&#39;s new take on the Bard, it seems more realistic with incorporating how the music should work before or after a battle.

You might have heard that outside 4th Edition I'm not much of a bard fan. You also might have heard that one of my complaints about Dungeon World is that it relies on the tropes of Dungeons & Dragons (not sure if I put that in a blog post yet). Granted in some cases it manages to improve on ...

        <p>I confess, I don&#39;t really understand the whole &quot;You have to pull out your (f)lute in battle&quot; thing as relating to the DW Bard.  The move text for Arcane Art just says &quot;weave a performance into a basic spell&quot; - as far as I can tell, it could be interpretive dance for all it matters WHAT the performance is.  The only move I can find that references an instrument at all is &quot;It Goes To Eleven&quot; and even that is just a parenthetical. <br /><br />So where does the &quot;playing a lute in combat&quot; thing come from? Arcane Art can clearly be represented as battle chant, or any other sort of performance you can dream of.</p>

        <p>Sounds like there is some similar stuff here to the Skald class I just posted yesterday. I also added a free Carouse move, some shouts and buffs, an insult move and a d8 damage die. Parallel design is neat. I accidentally put it in the discussion board instead of base class, but here is the link.<br /><br /><a href="https://plus.google.com/113214631078690927811/posts/Dkso4dRNLVx" class="ot-anchor">https://plus.google.com/113214631078690927811/posts/Dkso4dRNLVx</a></p>

        <p>C&#39;mon, work with me here. &quot;people&quot; are saying what I paraphrased in the article linked at the beginning of this whole conversation.<br /><br />The reason I find this so ridiculous is people are basically saying &quot;I&#39;ve important my idea of what a bard is from another game, and it&#39;s dumb, so the bard in this game is dumb.&quot;  And complain that this is a problem in a game that &quot;purports to put the fiction first.&quot;  When...they are not putting the fiction first.<br /><br />So I asked why. And the response is &quot;Isn&#39;t it obvious from all these other games?&quot;  And ask why I am starting to get annoyed? :)</p>

        <p>When it comes down to it, this is just one other option people can choose from. If someone wants to play the original bard they can. If they want to try David&#39;s why not? Doesn&#39;t matter what has happened in this game or that, it is always good to have some choices. Besides, we aren&#39;t shoving this bard down anyone&#39;s throat here.</p>

        <p>I like that this bard has moves that are rooted more in the realism; I can agree that it is a bard that could do things in a way that provides more narrative freedom. However, I don&#39;t really agree with the removal of Arcane Art. Sure the move may not make sense if you follow the tropes of a bard, but isn&#39;t swordplay an art, too?<br />I get that Stirring Speech is a replacement for it, allowing you to grant the boon to everyone before a fight, but the trigger should be changed to exclude the &quot;before a conflict.&quot; It should be up to the character if they want to expose themselves to a danger in order to inspire during a combat.<br />Also, all the &#39;before/after combat&#39; stuff could render the bard useless in a series of encounters that don&#39;t allow rest. If I am involved in a combat that immediately leads to a chase scene, or vise-versa, I&#39;m not going to make everyone wait while i encourage them.<br />Lastly, I don&#39;t see the purpose of Stories &amp; Legends. It doesn&#39;t differentiate itself from Spout Lore and introduces the chance of failure into your knowledge move. The point of bardic lore was you know a ton of obscure facts about the topic of your lore. You can still spout lore normally on things not covered.</p>

I think defining general swordplay as an art, and therefore a trigger for Arcane Art, is being pretty generous with the intention of the move.<br /><br />Stirring Speech is not a replacement for it (you&#39;ll note that the only thing it does similarly is grant a damage bonus, but it&#39;s to everyone). It was originally an Advanced Move, but people kept saying they wanted it as a starting move, so I moved it there.<br /><br />Now, if enough people say that they think it should be any time, I can edit it to make it all &quot;official&quot;, but if you want to help someone during a fight with speeches and shouting, Pep Talk and Inspiring Shout kind of cover that angle.<br /><br />How is the bard any less useful in a fight than the thief (which I have played up to 7th-level)? I could argue that &quot;in a string of fights I don&#39;t get to Backstab as often&quot;. Actually, in the campaign I was in I didn&#39;t get to use my starting moves very often at all.<br /><br />Bardic Lore lets you ask a question about any <i>one</i> thing (which, in our campaign, came up twice I think). Stories &amp; Legends lets you potentially ask questions about <i>any</i> thing, but you have to roll (instead of it just being automatic). That&#39;s the difference/purpose.<br /><br />Spout Lore doesn&#39;t let you ask questions, it lets you make a INT roll for the GM to tell you something. Stories &amp; Legends lets you ask questions, and you can still Spout Lore about it, too (which, might be a case to say something like, on a 10+ you take +1 to Spout Lore about the thing).</p>

        <p>On Spouting Lore: whether I ask the question on a topic using Stories &amp; Legends, or I Spout Lore on it, the GM will be telling me the same answer. Spout/Bardic Lore: &quot;You know that this is the Spear of Longinus, it is known to do these things. What Tale have you heard this from?&quot; Stories &amp; Legends: &quot;I&#39;ve heard of this spear in the book of Wu&#39;tever. What does it do?&quot; GM: &quot;You know that this is the Spear of Longinus, it is known to do these things.&quot;<br /><br />Bard vs Thief: Charm vs Poison. Thought narrative combat is what DW excels at, that doesn&#39;t mean all characters are one directional-ly directed into fighting, both of these classes, while having combat abilities, feature skills which can prevent combat, or sway the direction an series of events is headed in.<br /><br />Goes to Eleven, Metal Hurlant, and Vicious Blast: I don&#39;t see how these are relevant to the conversation unless you intentionally misinterpret the triggers. Goes to Eleven doesn&#39;t even make sense in the first place/can only be explained as magic, so who gives a damn. Metal Hurlant is a Dragon Shout or Power Chord. Vicious blast never mentions instruments.</p>

        <p>That&#39;s not true. Spout Lore has the GM tell you something interesting, while Stories &amp; Legends has you ask a question.<br /><br />I guess maybe if the GM tells you something and then you ask a question such that the GM can only give you the same information that you just learned it could play out that way.<br /><br />If you go the other way around, where you ask a question and then Spout Lore, it&#39;s probably the case of a dick GM, or the question you asked just so happens to be the only interesting thing about it.<br /><br />So, with your example, if the GM is actually forthcoming with all of the spear&#39;s stuff and you ask Spout Lore, I&#39;d say it&#39;s a dick GM that just gives you the same answer, instead of a variety of other &quot;interesting facts&quot; about it.<br /><br />You said that swordplay is an art, which I assume means that you would allow it to trigger Arcane Art because it &quot;may not make sense if you follow the tropes of a bard&quot;.<br /><br />My counter is that the game/move assumes you <i>are</i> following the trope, because It Goes to Eleven mentions instruments in the examples, and Metal Hurlant also mentions an instrument.<br /><br />It Goes to Eleven mentions righteous lute solo or might brass blast (maybe), and Metal Hurlant states &quot;play a shattering note&quot;. How is that misinterpreting the triggers?<br /><br />Also, Arcane Art IS magic. It is ALWAYS magic, because it says so right in the move (in case the Arcane bit didn&#39;t clue you in on that). <br /><br />My point is not that Arcane Art cannot be properly explained, just that it is quite silly. My bard makes the magical music aspect more subtle.</p>

        <p>The instruments in the parenthesis on Goes to Eleven are suggestions, as portrayed by the &quot;maybe.&quot; Metal Hurlant as well gives you an alternative to instruments, using your voice. It is possible, without even having to stretch the rules, to make a bard that doesn&#39;t play/sing a note. The instruments are optional.<br /><br />Arcane Art can&#39;t be explain; what magic can? I&#39;ve read plenty of books and never shot lightning from my fingertips. It&#39;s magic! IF you want a subtle bard, that&#39;s fine. I like an ostentatious, spooney bard. All spell casters don&#39;t make any damn sense.<br /><br />All prior arguments aside: What makes your Bard more interesting or innovative than the core book Bard? Your moves do make realistic sense, but I think the other one sounds like a more interesting character.</p>

I see up to bonds (pg. 5) and that&#39;s it.<br /><br />I like that you did something with carouse. I too, try to incorporate changes in the basic moves that are less commonly used. I also like the initial choice of what school of thought you come from - good choices there.<br /><br />Not a huge fan of the starting gear. Not sure what specifically, but I suppose it just doesn&#39;t feel &quot;special.&quot;<br /><br />I agree that there are good downtime starting moves here, but, as the bard is a good buffing class mid-combat, I struggle to see myself as doing much in the more tense and active situations as this class. Like I said, I might not be seeing advanced moves?<br /><br />And, for what it&#39;s worth, I don&#39;t dig the sheet too much. Something about using the original template makes it just fit better for me.</p>

        <p>What even strikes me more, when I step back and take a Bird&#39;s Eye look at the playbook, is that this really does feel like the kind of person that I would run into if I was living in a LOTR style world. The carousing those at a local tavern may look like any other normal person at first glance, but once they start talking or singing, you suddenly feel engrossed in their sound - like the forest scene where the bard began to sing. It is magical, sure, but it&#39;s like watching David Blane (sp?) perform magical feats. At first you wonder what the hell, but that&#39;s really just a normal dude.<br /><br />The subtlty of the class is pronounced here, which I don&#39;t think jives with everyone. I think it depends how you want to play your character.<br /><br />Does it make it better than the original Bard class? I think the overly mechanical nature is the only reason I don&#39;t ever choose the Bard. So the short answer is yes. Much better? Tough to say whether I would go out of my way to play this playbook. CHA playbooks are my favorite, but that Bard is so crunchy that it pains me.</p>

        <p>I get that they are suggestions: you are the one that said I misinterpreted the move triggers when I said that those moves provide a precedence for the lute-strumming bard, which is also supported by the source material for DW (ie, 1st Edition AD&amp;D).<br /><br />I don&#39;t know why you&#39;re bring up &quot;stretching the rules&quot;. I didn&#39;t say that. I said that I believe that the game assumes that strumming a lute in combat is not only perfectly valid, but an assumption.<br /><br />You&#39;re the one that said It Goes to Eleven Makes no sense, not me. Also, magic systems <i>can</i> (and usually do) make sense. It&#39;s when you get stuff like D&amp;D where it&#39;s spell slots and levels that it falls apart.<br /><br />Read <i>The Dresden Files</i> sometime: Jim Butcher does a good job of having Harry explain magic &quot;in character&quot;.<br /><br />I <i>do</i> agree that, when it comes to D&amp;D and it&#39;s clones/hacks/derivatives that yes, spellcasters make no sense. <br /><br /><i>All prior arguments aside: What makes your Bard more interesting or innovative than the core book Bard?</i><br /><br />I never made either claim.<br /><br /><i>I</i> find it more interesting/innovative because I designed it to do exactly what I wanted to, and judging by the sales plenty of people agree with it, either as a replacement, a change of pace, and/or as something to strip moves out of.<br /><br /><span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink" href="https://plus.google.com/101789477929813700533" oid="101789477929813700533">Chris S</a></span> Yeah, on one hand I want to do a more &quot;normal&quot; character sheet (changing out the icons like I normally do), but I&#39;m not a fan of the default character sheet anyway, so I think it&#39;s time I whip up a new one. &gt;_&gt;</p>

Something more subtle.<br /><br />I didn&#39;t want to take the &quot;core&quot; bard and just swap out/tweak a few moves: I really wanted to convey the kind of bard that <i>I</i> envision when I think about them (which is more Kvothe from <i>A Name of the Wind</i>).<br /><br />Like you said, not for everyone, maybe not for everyone all the time, but I think at the least that it is different enough in mechanics and feel.</p>
