Hey guys first time here, my group and I did our first run of dungeon world yesterday and it was awesome. One of my players wanted to be a craftsmen but there were no moves for characters to have professions. Has anyone ever created such a move?  Did I miss something in the book?

        <p>AFAIK there isn&#39;t a move dedicated for creating mundane tools. Depending on what the player wants to make, you could just say they do it, or give them an opportunity at a cost (GM move). If you want something more in the players control you could reskin the Wizard&#39;s Ritual move and turn it into a Workshop move. When the player wants to make something in his workshop the GM will say &quot;No problem, but...&quot; and then the GM picks out 1-4 things on the list of things that need to be filled before the item can be made. <br /><br />You could have the player use this as one of their multiclass moves when they level and just reskin or you could just leave it open to them, but it would depend on the level of abuse you&#39;re expecting your players to deal out.</p>

        <p>Welcome to the community and I hope you enjoy the game. I would just let the player be a craftsman of things mundane, like a blacksmith, and if they wanted to craft something more exotic they could learn a new move as they advance or perhaps quest for materials or information.</p>

        <p>Would it be to much to give them a move where if they spend downtime working at a profession to let them roll for income?</p>

        <p>Welcome to the tavern. In addition to figuring out what happens in tense or unknown situations, moves also help define what the game is about. When you turn something into a move, you&#39;re saying &quot;this thing is important enough to give it mechanical weight&quot;. Is working at a profession that important to your game?<br /><br />If it is, that&#39;s totally cool. It&#39;s it&#39;s not, then I&#39;d just keep everything fictional. Give the character a few coins after a stretch of downtime to represent them spending time at their craft. Assume that the character can, with time, effort, and materials, make decent versions of whatever craft they studied.</p>

        <p>If, for whatever reason, you&#39;re not Filling Their Lives With Adventure (one of your jobs as GM), and they have the time to work a real job, just give them a little bit of coin. Nothing much; enough to push them into <b>adventuring</b> and not filling out Tax Returns and Small Business Permits.<br /><br />DW doesn&#39;t really do &quot;here&#39;s my background: I cobble shoes <i>so good</i>&quot; moves. Moves are about, generally, resolving dramatic situations framing story advancement. So, basically: No, a &quot;smithing&quot; move is terrible because what&#39;s your miss result that is always applicable? That matters? That creates story?<br /><br />If your game is about blue collar, settled, employed heroes who occasionally bash dragons, make a more general &quot;when you work an honest day&quot; move that you roll at the start of most sessions. Let it work like carouse, to let the players make money, get patrons, and learn cool facts. Make the downside that they put themselves or loved ones in the way of the gears of mundane life -- school, disease, the nobility, love, tragedy.<br /><br />If your game is adventure and this is just to make money? Don&#39;t make a move. Just pay them some coin and move on, it doesn&#39;t matter enough to roll. If your angle is adventurers who have roots in the community? Go for the general &quot;I have a job/community role&quot; move.</p>

        <p>It just so happens I had been playing about with the idea of a crafting move and had one saved. I tried to keep it as generic as possible (and to be honest, the topic is pretty mundane :P), but if you want players to be rolling for things rather than just giving them a cost and time to create something (which might be more desirable, as explained by everyone else) then maybe this will suffice:<br /><br />Work a craft:<br />When you have the means and resources to create something appropriate to your craft, describe what you&#39;re trying to create and roll+ an appropriate ability modifier. You create the item in a basic form, in addition... -On a 10+, choose 3. -On a 7-9 choose 2.<br />•Your fine detailing work increases the value of the item. Describe the look that makes it so desirable.<br />•Your craftsmanship is solid. Not only does your creation do its job, it does it well.<br />•You know the ins and outs of your craft. You complete your project in a much shorter time than your average journeyman.<br />•Through efficient planning and management, you end up using fewer resources than you first anticipated.<br /><br />(This was kinda a rough idea, if you end up using it and changing some stuff I&#39;d be interested to see what you do with it :D)</p>
