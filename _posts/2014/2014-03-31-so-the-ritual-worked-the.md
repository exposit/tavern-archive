So the ritual worked, the Bard lost his body and became the shadow dragon. They battle stone demons and win.<br /><br />Unfortunately the Bard failed to inform the Druid of his transformation. So the Druid, in the form of a Demonic Stone Catfish, summons elemental fire in its maw and blasts the shadow dragon like a furnace, killing it.<br /><br />That compendium class didn&#39;t last long.  Once again the Druid is the most dangerous thing the players have ever met.<br /><br />And the Bard is still not dead. Now he is a living shadow.

        <p>That Catfish was more frightening that the Shadow Dragon. Luckily almost the whole fight was in the dark. Or should that be &#39;unluckily&#39;?</p>

        <p>Dude I am sure it says in the rules &quot;The bard dies.&quot; <br /><br />Go read it again.</p>

        <p><span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink" href="https://plus.google.com/112147093164383759456" oid="112147093164383759456">Ernesto Pavan</a></span>, the Druid smartly chose to summon earth elementals by whispering sweet nothings to heathen idols, terrible gods and foreign demons of murder and blood carved in the ancient walls of a temple deep within Death Mountain. Then  he promptly studied them in detail for hours whilst trapped in the dark alone with the dozen or so of them.<br /><br />I&#39;m surprised he only killed one of the party members.<br /><br />O that&#39;s right, the Bard didn&#39;t die.</p>

        <p>The Ranger leaves the group alone for one session and this what happens!<br /><br />Seriously, very cool stuff. We set this up last session, so something serious was bound to go down, but this sounds awesome. Sorry I missed it.<br /><br />Question: what was the sacrifice?</p>

Well your &quot;friends&quot; had to lay her somewhere to rest and the ritual circle was so clean of sticks and stones.</p>

        <p>&quot;The Druid Hycorax has grown beyond your control. Soon he will spread through these lands, as he has spread through Death Mountain. You cannot stop him. But I can.&quot;<br /></p>
