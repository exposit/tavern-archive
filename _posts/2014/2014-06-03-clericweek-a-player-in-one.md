<a rel="nofollow" class="ot-hashtag" href="https://plus.google.com/s/%23ClericWeek/posts">#ClericWeek</a><br /><br />A player in one of my groups did not like how some of the available spells (e.g. Cause Fear, Speak with Dead) fit his Good-aligned Cleric&#39;s concept so we looked at converting over a few spells from D&amp;D that he could potentially swap out as an alternate.  These are what we came up for 1st level as a first pass:<br /><br />Command 1<br />One living creature obeys one-word command for 1 round.<br /><br />Comprehend Languages 1 Ongoing<br />Understand all spoken and written languages.  Written material is read at 1 page/min for a maximum of 10 min/level.  While this spell is ongoing you take -1 to cast a spell.<br /><br />Healthful Rest 1<br />Up to 1 target/level may recover full HP when Making Camp.<br /><br />Hide from Undead 1 Ongoing<br />Up to 1 target/level is warded.  Non-intelligent undead cannot see, hear, smell or otherwise sense the warded targets.  If a warded creature attempts to turn or command undead, touches an undead creature, or attacks any creature (even with a spell), the spell ends for all recipients.  While this spell is ongoing you take -1 to cast a spell.<br /><br />Inhibit 1<br />Subject delays making any type of move until next round.<br /><br />Lesser Vigor 1<br />Creature touched gains 1 HP per round for 10 rounds + 1 rnd/level (max 15).<br /><br />Nimbus of Light 1 Ongoing<br />You glow like lantern (30ft radius).  As a Move, gather light then fling as a Volley for your damage.  Attack ends spell.  While this spell is ongoing you take -1 to cast a spell.<br /><br />Ray of Resurgence 1<br />Remove one debility from target.<br /><br />Resurgence 1<br />Target may reroll a failed (6-) Last Breath roll.  This must be cast in the round after the original Last Breath roll is made.<br /><br />Rudy Henkel had also posted up a list of alternate spells a while back: <a href="https://plus.google.com/113109478365341925413/posts/bUR2NbnhjUc" class="ot-anchor">https://plus.google.com/113109478365341925413/posts/bUR2NbnhjUc</a>

        <p>There are also &quot;1 target/level&quot; and &quot;10 minutes/level&quot;. These are not so good.</p>

        <p>1 Target per level is an acceptable mechanic I think.</p>

        <p>The round mechanic, as stressed above, doesnt fit - unless you made it fit with some interesting definition of round.  That said, the ideas behind the ones youve worked with make sense but because the moves have to essentially have a cause and effect relationship with the player actions and the environment, try to think of them that way.<br /><br />For instance, with inhibit, a forced delay may be something  that gives an ally +1 forward to defy danger associated with the target.  So, it does something to the target, but because delay means less in a no-initiative mechanic set, it can provide something which can follow the fiction.  Though, I dont love tracking effects across everyone, so perhaps the target gets a -1 forward to its next action as that limits bookkeeping.<br /><br />Command I&#39;ve always thought of as something that just <i>hits</i> someone, which they do immediately and it has no time associated with it.  I think it actually plays better in a no-round game than it does in one.   Stop!  Drop!  Turn!  Jump!   Imperious exclamation.  The target must react as if by instinct, as if they feel an impending danger.   I&#39;ve always thought sleep was <i>not</i> something command did.  <br /><br />Lesser vigor&#39;s a bit much and the round mechanic doesn&#39;t work.   You could use it as a mechanic to promote action (making the target more vigorous).  Give it a hold mechanic, like hold 3, 5, whatever.   For each hold on a target, they can regain one hitpoint, or use it for one action/narration as a +1 forward for a physical act.  <br /><br />Just spitballing, and I&#39;m not going through them all, but I like the spell themes and think you could certainly rework them a tick. </p>

        <p>I don&#39;t like it very much.<br />What are the moves or options that become stronger and stronger with the level up?<br />Level isn&#39;t an indicator of the power...more levels = more options. Usually.<br /><br />I&#39;m sorry for my english, I&#39;m writing in a hurry. ^_^</p>

        <p>For command, I&#39;d straight up make it a move if it&#39;s a core thing for their cleric.<br /><br /><b>Command</b><br />When you <b>Give a command backed by the divine Authority of your God to a person or creature that can hear you</b> roll+Wis. On a 10+, hold 3 Influence. On a 7-9, hold 3 influence, but you will be unable to command anyone else until you have rested and prayed to your God. Spend Influence, 1 for 1, on the following.<br /><br />-Give them a simple command like &quot;Go there, attack them, stop, bow&quot;<br />-Get them to step into harm&#39;s way to protect you or another.<br />-Ask them a question, they will answer it truthfully.</p>

        <p>Does that work on player characters? Also, this is strictly better then I am the Law...</p>

        <p>I would say that it does work on PCs, unless there&#39;s a compelling fictional reason why it doesn&#39;t.<br /><br />There&#39;s also plenty of good reasons why you <i>shouldn&#39;t</i> use it on your allies, such as all those poisons the thief carries around, and the fighter&#39;s big evil axe.</p>

        <p>I think there is a game philosophy reason. In a World game you usually can&#39;t tell other characters what they do. You can&#39;t take control away from them, they always have a choice. (Unless you are the Vampire in Mo sterhearts) for DW as an example see Parley and I am the Law.</p>

        <p>That&#39;s a pretty good case to not allow it, absolutely.</p>

        <p>Some quick rewrites based on feedback:<br /><br />Command 1<br />One living target that is weaker than you (as decided by the GM) must obey a one-word command.  The target must be able to understand the command and the command must be something that the target can accomplish instantaneously such as Fall, Jump, Ungrapple, or Drop.<br /> <br />Comprehend Languages 1 Ongoing<br />You can understand one language (written or spoken) that is foreign to you.  If your Cast a Spell roll was 7-9, your understanding may be incomplete or inaccurate.<br /> <br />Healthful Rest 1<br />One target may recover full HP when Making Camp.<br /> <br />Hide from Undead 1 Ongoing<br />One target is warded.  Non-intelligent undead cannot see, hear, smell or otherwise sense the warded target.  The spell may be recast later to add the effect to another target.  If a warded creature attempts to turn or command undead, touches an undead creature, or attacks any creature (even with a spell), this spell ends for all current recipients.  While this spell is ongoing you take -1 to cast a spell, irrespective of the number of current recipients.<br /> <br />Inhibit 1<br />[Option 1] One living target that is weaker than you (as decided by the GM) cannot act except to speak until you make another move. This effect ends immediately if the target takes damage from any source.<br />OR<br />[Option 2] Choose a target and gain 3 Hold.  One Hold may be spent to give an ally +1 to Defy Danger against the target.<br /> <br />Lesser Vigor 1<br />Creature touched gains 1 HP every time they execute a move up to a maximum of 10 HP.<br /> <br />Nimbus of Light 1 Ongoing<br />You glow like lantern (30ft radius).  As a move, gather light then fling as a Volley for your damage.  Attack ends spell.  While this spell is ongoing you take -1 to cast a spell.<br /> <br />Ray of Resurgence 1<br />Remove one debility from target.  This spell may not be cast on the same target again until after Making Camp.<br /> <br />Resurgence 1<br />Target may reroll a failed (6-) Last Breath roll.  This must be cast immediately after the original Last Breath roll is made.</p>

        <p>I am thinking the 7-9 on Comprehend Languages is an alternate to being put in a spot as you will get incomplete or inaccurate info from the GM.<br /><br />For Healthful Rest, you can always just recast it to have it affect additional people (unless you have a bad roll and it is revoked).</p>
