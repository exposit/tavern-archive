I don&#39;t think i understand this system when a player is attacking if the player rolls above a ten the player is hit by the enemy but when the enemy attacks the players the players don&#39;t get to deal their damage to the enemies.﻿

        <p>On a 10+, the player character deals damage and is <i>not</i> damaged. They can <i>choose</i> to deal bonus damage by letting the enemy attack.<br /><br />Player characters do not <i>normally</i> deal damage in the middle of an enemy&#39;s attack because enemies attack during a <i>hard move</i>, which is covered under the GM guidelines in the PDF.</p>

        <p>10+ does not allow for an enemy move (such as attacking), 9 or less does.</p>

        <p>In most cases, the enemy only &quot;attacks&quot; when the player blows a roll - they don&#39;t (usually) attack in the same way a PC does.  Except when required by the fiction, enemies execute moves in response to what the PCs have done, so most damage inflicted by enemies is a result of a bad player roll (either the player rolls a failure which opens the PC to damage, or the player rolls a &#39;qualified&#39; success and opts to open the character to damage in order to inflict damage).  As a GM, you need to teach yourself to &quot;react&quot; more often than you &quot;act&quot;, which can be a hard thing based on one&#39;s gaming experience.</p>

        <p>Hi <span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink" href="https://plus.google.com/109216484998476755782" oid="109216484998476755782">Treksh Marwaha</a></span> ! The Dungeon World System understands that combat happens simultaneously and then simplyfies the rolls by doing just one that decides what happens. In a simple way, a skilled combatent will fight better than a unexperienced one, and therefore, will take less/cause more damage. Thanks.</p>

        <p>There are no turns. The enemy doesn&#39;t just &quot;hit&quot; the players for no reason except its their turn. Generally the only time the monsters hits the players are the results of a player&#39;s roll, although there other times where it makes sense in the fiction.</p>

The difference is if the players get an opportunity to react or not.<br />An enemy attacking you is the <br />Put someone in a spot move</p>

        <p>+Tim Franzke, but once you&#39;re into the flow of combat, most of it is keying off of what the players do (until or unless the fiction demands otherwise).  As you said, the enemy attack is a setup for what happens next.</p>
