Here&#39;s an inquisitor class I made a long time ago. I actually made a lot of classes but never shared them with the Dungeon World tavern, hah. Anyway, this was my first try at creating a custom class and my inspiration came from all over the place, but the feel I was going for was a gritty detective getting caught up in webs of lies way out of his league. I tried to evoke the feeling of a mundane person that investigates magical or supernatural crimes and mysteries, and is somewhat armed to solve them as well. I think this class would really shine in a noir style game, or anything not involving excessive dungeon crawling, really.

        <p>I never actually playtested the thing so it&#39;s possible that it&#39;s completely unbalanced. Use at your own discretion or houserule it if it&#39;s overkill, haha.</p>
