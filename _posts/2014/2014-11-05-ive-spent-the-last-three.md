I&#39;ve spent the last three hours editing it, and &quot;soon&quot; wasn&#39;t soon enough! Here&#39;s <b>Puppet Master v.15</b> (Thanks to <span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink" href="https://plus.google.com/101076298485951808085" oid="101076298485951808085">Andrea Parducci</a></span>).<br /><br />Any suggestions for the class or ideas for Bonds, Upgrades, Names, or whatever else would be appreciated.

        <p>I love the concept because it fits right into the feel of my clockpunk world, and the execution seems neat on paper.<br />I will definitely make this available at my table.</p>

        <p>I feel like making your puppet large should be a move you can take, not something you pay for.</p>

        <p>Do you roll put your back into it together with other moves or instead of hack&amp;slash? It reads really weird. ﻿<br /><br />Flick is weird too. This move triggers EVERY TIME you are in a tight spot, no matter if you have a puppet strung or not. Also it just feels like a defy danger with a more specific condition (well a lot of moves are that but this one is really just Defy). ﻿<br /><br />Element of Surprise seems like a 2-5 move.</p>

        <p>about Sundering Limbs, maybe you could remove the move, and add a similar mechanic to a new &quot;perk&quot; worth 1 or 2 points. Of course, the main use of this perk is the ability to remove a part to guide it in thigh spaces (maybe reconstruct the whole puppet on &quot;the other side&quot;), or make some kind of weird attack (use the detached hand to blind the enemy). Maybe you can&#39;t use the single detached parts altogether, just 1 at time. And maybe with the multitask / crowd move you could move all the parts at once.  </p>

        <p>To me it just feels weird that you have to pay extra costs for a large puppet while all the other frames come for free. If it is harder to control only higher level puppeteers cN use them - I don&#39;t see them as extra complex though.</p>

        <p>I don&#39;t feel like the payoff with PYBII is actually worth it. The effect you get is rather small and there are little incentives of having a high STR i fear. <br /><br />Flick seems to involved mechanically to be worth it. Rolling twice for one move seems more punishing and fiddly then fun. </p>

        <p>Neat idea, but it needs a lot of work. Here are a couple problems I see:<br /><br />I feel like Recurring Defects should either be wiped, or just be a thing that all your puppets should have, instead of being a way to add points to your puppet (I don&#39;t really like min-maxing, especially in a star-world game, and that&#39;s really all the defect refunds are there for, no?). Especially since it currently lets you take a 4-point upgrade at level one, which leads to things like doing d8 damage or having a level 3 Wizard spell when the actual Wizard in the party won&#39;t get that for another long while.<br /><br />Also, and this admittedly is much more a pet peeve than a genuine design flaw: I&#39;m not generally fond of what I&#39;d call fake damage dice. The top of the sheet says that you&#39;re doing d4, but really you&#39;re pretty much always going to be attacking with a puppet, which will probably have a dice size of d6 or d8. Low base damage as a balance factor (insofar as that idea actually applies) only really works if you <i>actually</i> have low base damage.<br /><br />That said, I don&#39;t think you really need to have your base damage that low. As-is, the class doesn&#39;t really <i>do</i> much. The puppetmaster doesn&#39;t really have anything move-wise aside from controlling the puppets, and said puppets are narratively and mechanically weaker than a normal PC for the most part (aside from the whole &quot;major damage is only a single break point&quot; thing, but that&#39;s... kind of a weird can of worms on its own).<br /><br />I also think that the limited-use spare parts mechanic is a bad idea; every other playbook&#39;s main schtick (and hit points) get to refresh pretty much no matter where you are, at least when you make camp. I mean sure, the wizard can lose their spellbook or the fighter can lose their weapon, but that&#39;s the kind of thing that happens as a result of a hard-move or general narrative imperative; by making Spare Parts a limited-use piece of equipment, you&#39;re ensuring that the class <i>will</i> lose its basic functionality after a pretty short stretch.</p>

        <p>I feel the d4 base class damage is right. Even the wizard has d4, but usually make more damage, &#39;cause he almost always use his magic. The same here, the puppetter is &quot;forced&quot; to use his puppets if he want to do some serious damages.<br />About the spare parts, I think they should be a narrative thing too, not a limited-use equip. Maybe you could add a Quality Spare Parts Pouch (or a Magic one), that remove <i>slow</i> tag, and let the Puppetter to fast repair something, so he can choose to waste some money on it and do on-the-fly repairs sometime.</p>

The puppet master kinda doesn&#39;t right now; the puppets are basically below-average melee fighters that don&#39;t really have any interesting tricks of their own besides relying on DEX for every roll.<br /><br />If the upgrade system gave them similar narrative flexibility to the Wizard, the low damage die might make a little more sense, but since combat seems to be mostly what the the puppets are going to be doing, it just seems kinda like a 3.5 feat tax situation. You&#39;re forced to take certain options (which, when they&#39;re that compulsory, they aren&#39;t really options) to make the class do what it&#39;s supposed to do at a basic level, when other playbooks start off able to do that and pick up other neat tricks as they go along.<br /><br />Seriously, I feel like you&#39;re being way too cautious with what your moves do–which, don&#39;t get me wrong, is respectable considering some of the narratively overwhelming homebrews I&#39;ve seen. But try going a little crazy with what the class can do; you might come up with some neat ideas that way. People will tell you if you&#39;ve gone too far.</p>

        <p>I understand your point. Maybe Stewart should come with new cool moves, and some little power up. However, I think that the puppeteer can be useful in a lot of ways: send the Puppet in dangerous places, in the mouth of a trap, using them like lures, resolving social issues if they look like specific people or monsters. Also, they are quite disposable, so the puppeteer can defend himself using them like shield. I see them more useful than a Ranger companion or a wizard summoned monster. Not just a sort of warrior weapon.</p>

Should puppets just get bigger bonuses to damage?<br /><br /><b>Narrative Spare Parts</b>: Good point. Should structural damage be wholly narrative, if Break Points are weird? It was in the older versions, but I ended up feeling that it should be quantified in some way.<br /><br /><b>Upgrade System</b>: I&#39;ve thought of scrapping it and trying something new because of the confusion it presented to a guy who play-tested it a while back.<br /><br />Instead, how about something along the lines of the Mage&#39;s Foci? in that there are a handful of puppet &quot;builds&quot; you can choose from. Then, you choose a size from below that build, which tells you your puppet&#39;s starting Break Points, weight, tags, and extra damage. Next, you can pick an upgrade that develops an aspect of the build&#39;s focus.<br /><br />Farther down on the page can be a few upgrades that can be applied, given the time and supplies. In exchange for this change to a more limited Upgrade style, I&#39;ll brainstorm about how I can buff up the player&#39;s moves.<br /><br />Sorry if that&#39;s a bit much to read now, but I think it would be very simple to follow in character creation. It&#39;d also make level-to-level management a lot easier, especially if you were to carry a lot of puppets at once.</p>

        <p>Here&#39;s an early v.16<br /><br />Most of the changes were to the Upgrade system. Now there are 4 Builds based around Attack, Defense, Hidden Weapons, and Imitation respectively. There are some more Advanced Moves and Expert Moves as well.<br /><br /><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B9hnDZsDk5iIZFpFYWUwVnhmak0/view?usp=sharing" class="ot-anchor">https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B9hnDZsDk5iIZFpFYWUwVnhmak0/view?usp=sharing</a></p>
