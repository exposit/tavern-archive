<a rel="nofollow" class="ot-hashtag" href="https://plus.google.com/s/%23MagicItemMonday/posts">#MagicItemMonday</a><br /><br />The Vessel of Grummash<br /><br />&quot;The shaman twisted the knife inside of my squire, and his lifeblood filled a bowl that the orc held in his free hand. Dabbing the warm blood over his empty eye-socket, he roared, &#39;Now you will tell me the truth!&#39;&quot;<br /><br />This wooden bowl is marked with orcish runes, and has been heavily stained with blood. When you fill the Vessel of Grummash with 3 HP worth of blood, choose a person, place, or thing. Then roll+WIS. *On a hit, you receive a vision of the object, as clearly as if you were there. *On a 10+ you may also ask two questions about the target from the Discern Realities list. *On a 6- you draw unwelcome attention to yourself, either from your target or from an angry orcish god. <br /><br />If you use your own blood, take +1. If you did not use the blood of an intelligent creature, take -1.
