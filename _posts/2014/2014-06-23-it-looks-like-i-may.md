It looks like I may be running Dungeon World at a store on a regular basis as the game I ran on Saturday for freerpgday went really well. <span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink" href="https://plus.google.com/112484087750169360510" oid="112484087750169360510">Adam Koebel</a></span> do you have any plans for an organized play program? If the store is willing to print sheets for me is it allright if I give them the basic moves/character sheet pdf? What distributors carry DW so I can tell the store how to get it? <span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink" href="https://plus.google.com/113864117304127544117" oid="113864117304127544117">Johnstone Metzger</a></span> I use Truncheon World extensively while running DW is it available in distribution or only as a print on demand or pdf from drivethrurpg, ie: is there a way for a brick n mortar store to sell it?

        <p>Organized play takes community managers and distro channels to stores and all that stuff takes $$$ and me and Sage are just two dudes. DW isn&#39;t really big enough for anything official. We rely on awesome fans (like you!) to play the game with local groups. I <i>can</i> however, help you with the following;<br /><br />1) The sheets are totally available for printing by whomever wants to print &#39;em. That PDF is free and okay to distribute like crazy.<br /><br />2) Dungeon World is currently being stocked by IPR and Alliance.</p>

        <p>All my books are POD only, through Lulu and DriveThruRPG. At my level, there&#39;s not a lot of incentive to chasing distribution, but I would still be happy to at least talk to a brick and mortar store that&#39;s interested in stocking my stuff.</p>

Magic makes money, and to a much lesser extent DnD and PF. So those are the games you are going to see at stores. While no store owner will stop you from doing a once off here and there, you will find that they do not support you unless you generate sales. <br /><br />It&#39;s nothing personal. It&#39;s business. </p>

I worked at a game store for 2 years, running events, and we wanted people in the store for whatever reason. Sure, magic tournaments are lucrative because there&#39;s a buy-in but people in the store look at games before, during and after - they&#39;re exposed to your merchandise. They talk about games, they share stories about other games they&#39;ve played and they <i>buy stuff</i>. There&#39;s also dice and snacks and other side-market miscellanea that any store set up to run events should consider. We&#39;d sometimes rent out table or room space to groups for $10 an hour / table or whatever but that $ was refunded as a gift certificate, so it turned into merch sales anyway.<br /><br />It&#39;s not all about everyone at the table purchasing a copy of the main rulebook.</p>

Which is to say: he wants to play again.</p>

        <p>What Adam said is spot on. The store didn&#39;t have any DW products to sell nor was there anything DW related to give away for FreeRPGday but they did sell 5 sodas to me n the 4 other players and one set of dice to one player. I posted the store name to g+ and Facebook (I haven&#39;t reposted it as the name is changing and I don&#39;t have the details yet) giving them a little free advertising. A couple of the players for my game stuck around after and played/bought magic cards. The other table was running 13th age which the store also didn&#39;t have any product for beyond the free adventure for freerpgday.</p>
