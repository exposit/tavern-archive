Another custom move for my Black Company/Game of Thrones inspired DW game for those folks who want to play Littlefinger and run a business.<br /><br />When you attend to the workings of a business at the beginning of each session or during downtime roll +Int<br /><br />On a 10+ Choose 2<br />·         Your business expands into new markets +1 Profit<br />·         Your business gains the attention of a useful ally or patron.<br />·         Your business earns you 1d6 coin per point of profit it possesses.<br /><br />On a 7-9 Choose 2 from the above list, but there’s a problem too that’s disrupting business as usual. Deal with it or watch your business suffer.<br /><br />On a 6- Your business suffers a nasty setback. -1 Proft and unless you deal with the problem that faces it, expect it to suffer more.<br /><br />A new business requires at least 50 Coin to start along with workers to partake in it and starts at 0 Profit. If you invest 100 Coin +100 Coin per point of Profit your Business currently has into your business, increase it&#39;s Profit by 1. Adding significant fictional improvements (like replacing your workers with tireless golem slaves or conjured demons) will also increase profit, but may have other repercussions.

        <p>I feel like it will take very long for your thing to actually turn into making you coin? Showering players with a bunch of coin shouldn&#39;t be a problem for the game. Be generous. <br />Like 4d8x10 coin? </p>

That means a business started for 50gp will reliably recoup it&#39;s investment in a session or two if you have a decent Int and with investment and good rolls will be giving you a nice nest egg that you can parley into future profitability.<br /><br />Thoughts?</p>

        <p>Actually that doesn&#39;t work out too well-you still end up with most businesses not recouping their investment. Maybe 1d10x10 per point of profit. So 1 profit is 10-100 gp, 2 profit is 20-200, 3 profit is 30-300 and so on and so forth.</p>
