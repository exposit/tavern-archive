I&#39;ve been toying with this playbook for several weeks now, and made some changes based on some friend&#39;s advice, which I thought might warrant a re-share. Still heavily based on the Avatar cartoon series. I am still in need of commentary or play-tests, if anyone is interested - I haven&#39;t had any opportunities to run it or play it myself.<br /><br />Also adding <span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink" href="https://plus.google.com/109939241288748507006" oid="109939241288748507006">Lemmo Pew</a></span> , who had expressed some interest in seeing if some players were willing to try a slightly older version. <br /><br />As always, thanks all!

        <p>Seems nice, but i&#39;m a little biased since i love elementalists. </p>

        <p>im a little confused by one bit<br /><br />One of the tags on the water move is precise<br />Which lets you hack and slash with DEX<br /><br />However my impression was that if I hack and slash with my element as a weapon I would be using my manipulate STAT, which in waters case would already be DEX?<br /><br />Or do you H&amp;S and volley attacks use STR and DEX as normal, which would make earth much better (stat wise) for close combat H&amp;S and air the clear choice for ranged attacks (and with precise tag for H&amp;S too), where as fire and water, suffer in attacks as they have to foucs on two stats<br /><br />Can you clear up for me?<br /><br />I only ask because I LOVE this class, and your build is pretty much my fave so far :D</p>

        <p>Hey, <span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink" href="https://plus.google.com/109015870893735836823" oid="109015870893735836823">Andrew Murphy</a></span>! Thanks for the kind words!  You are correct that H&amp;S and Volley both function normally - only the defend move is modified by the character&#39;s manipulate STAT. Aid/interfere is also modified via a level up move. <br /><br /> Water should not have precise as an option,  it should be piercing,  hazard,  and forceful. Might be a typo. <br /><br />That having been said,  i have been looking at the tag lists for each of the variants to see what balances best - one of the ones I an looking at hardest is precise on the air touched list.  Hopefully some play testing will help me figure out the fully final setup. <br /><br />I hope this answers your question,  I&#39;ve been struggling to find solid and easy language to describe the mechanics on elemental mastery.</p>

        <p>urgh im a tit! its air that has precise! &gt;_&lt; sorry<br /><br />thanks for confirming makes much more sense now, and even the air move being precise :)<br /><br />I think maybe just putting that elemental master can be used in place of a weapon in bold, and maybe mention &quot;throwing bolder instead of shooting a bow, or thrusting with water instead of a sword&quot; might help people see its just a &quot;weapon&quot; not a replacement for hack and slash or volley (maybe even state that?)<br /><br />but yeah i love the class, something myself and one of my players really want<br /><br />and seeing how your playbook really specialises the elements (thier own moves and bonuses - ESPECIALLY the earthbender background bonus/negative) we might run a 4 elementalist game for kicks</p>

        <p>Thanks a bunch,  <span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink" href="https://plus.google.com/109015870893735836823" oid="109015870893735836823">Andrew Murphy</a></span> :), and glad I could clear things up!  I&#39;m still tinkering with some of the language,  so hopefully I can avoid confusion for anyone else who is interested in the class.  If you do end up running it, or you manage to get a full foursome going,  I&#39;d LOVE to hear how it goes!</p>
