        <p><b>Invulnerability Sphere</b> feels kinda meh.  I have to choose 2 damage types when I take the move, and then spend level-ups to expand these?  And magical versions are right-out?  If I specialize in defensive magic, I want to be bad-ass at defense.<br /><br />I&#39;d go much bigger, but still make them plan ahead.  Maybe like this:<br /><br />&quot;When you spend some time (an hour or so) attuning your personal defenses, pick two of the following damage types and roll +INT.  On a 10+, hold 3 <i>protection</i>. On a 7-9, hold 2 <i>protection</i>. Spend 1 <i>protection</i> to negate one instance of that type of damage that you would suffer. <br />...&lt;list of damage types; I&#39;d add &quot;Mental&quot; or &quot;Psychic&quot; to the list&gt;...<br />On a miss, hold 2 <i>protection</i> but the GM will choose one of the damage types picked. Your sphere is ineffective against that damage type.<br /><br />Maybe add that you get +Armor equal to <i>protection</i>, or just that you have +1 Armor while you have <i>protection</i>.<br /><br />Edit: Just saw <b>Punishing Defense</b>.  Nice.  <del>I&#39;d recommend an advanced move that lets you deflect such damage, or store it for later, or that turns it a </del><i><del>fireshield</del></i><del>-like effect that hurts others who try to harm you.</del> </p>

        <p>OK, critique on most of the other moves.  Obviously this is all just my opinion, take it with a grain of salt, etc.  I think you&#39;re hitting the key ideas of what an abjurer should be able to do... mostly I&#39;m quibbling with the details of implementation.<br /><br />I didn&#39;t like <b>Magical Defender</b> at first, but I really like it the more I think about it.  Maybe add a line about having to tell us what it looks like when you spend hold?<br /><br />In general, I don&#39;t see the need for the &quot;-1 ongoing to cast a spell&quot; limitation. I assume they&#39;re meant to apply to the various abjurer moves, right?  But why?  I&#39;m giving up offense &amp; proactivity for defense &amp; reactivity.  Just seems like a needless penalty.<br /><br /><b>Armored</b>... Not a huge fan of wizards-in-armor.  An abjurer strikes more as the aikido-master of magic: peaceful, serene, prepared.  Having magical defenses makes more sense to (like the +Armor from Invulnerability Sphere).<br /><br /><b>Counterspell</b>... Could you make it more broad, like Defy Danger?  &quot;When you weave magic to deflect or dispel magic, roll +Int. On a 10+, it&#39;s like you say. On a 7-9, the GM will offer you a hard bargain, lesser result, or unfortunate consequence.&quot;<br /><br /><b>Warding</b>... hard to picture what the &quot;complication&quot; would be.  What I went for in my own hack is that when you draw a ward against something, pick 3:  It can&#39;t enter the warded area // It can&#39;t leave the warded area // It&#39;s senses can&#39;t pierce the ward // It&#39;s magic can&#39;t pierce the ward.  Then on a 7-9, the GM decides (in secret) which one of the three didn&#39;t work.<br /><br /><b>Shared Sphere</b>... if you take my advice above, I&#39;d recommend that there still be just 1 pool of <i>protection</i> shared between you.  Maybe word it so that you can spend 1 <i>protection</i> to simultaneously protect both of you?<br /><br /><b>Banish</b>... Strongly dislike the option of &quot;will not seek revenge on you.&quot; Like, if I banish Orcus and choose that one, he isn&#39;t going to seek revenge on me?  Fat bloody chance.  Also not sure about the other choices. Like, I sorta see how the dynamic could work to raise tension, but it&#39;s kinda opaque.  How about: On a 10+, you immediately banish it from this reality for now. On a 7-9, it resists your spell, becoming locked in a battle of wills with you. You may try again or relent, your call.<br /><br /><b>Imprison</b>... nice!  But maybe make the 10+ result basically the same as the <i>forcecage</i> spell (can&#39;t cast a spell and it can hear your thoughts, but otherwise indefinite). <br /><br /><b>Arcane Lock</b>... the description (&quot;magical magnetism&quot;) makes me think it&#39;s a pretty weak force.  Which makes me think it&#39;s not very useful.  Maybe make the language stronger if that&#39;s your intent? <br /><br /><b>Forceful Dissipation</b>... I really like this one.<br /><br /><b>Sheltering Sphere</b>... maybe describe the fictional triggers or limitations? Like, how big is it?  Is it imobile? Do I need to etch some runes or something? <br /><br /><b>Forever Imprisoned</b>... maybe make there be some requirement other than (or in addition to) the permanent debility?  Like the victim&#39;s true name, a drop of their blood, their prized possession.  Ooh! Maybe this is the abjurer&#39;s <b>Ritual</b>... tell the GM what you want to imprison for all time and he&#39;ll tell you &quot;sure, you can do that, but...&quot; and pick 2-4 things.  (Minor: maybe <b>Eternal Prison</b> would sound better?)<br /><br /><b>Other Stuff</b>... maybe some sort of <i>contingency</i> spell?  I guess Invulnerability Sphere sort of gets at this, but something where you can say &quot;if X happens to me, it&#39;s gonna be all sorts of bad for whoever did it.&quot;<br /><br />Also, some sort of nondetection/protection from scrying spell would be sweet.  Though you might work that into <b>Warding.</b> </p>

I am definitely appreciative. I&#39;ll certainly be making some changes based on what you&#39;ve said. Thank you again for taking so much time to look at this. Would you mind to take a look at my Spectrumancer and Conjuror sometime? Let me know if you need any links. Thanks!</p>

The GM will tell you the requirements to set it up. For example “When I die, use Eternal Imprisonment on whatever killed me.” The GM may require a ritual of some kind or special materials to cast the Contingency. The Contingency is set up until you spend time to change it. You may only have one contingency at a time.</p>

        <p>Yeah, that&#39;s the sort of thing I was thinking. Maybe play with the wording a bit, but definitely sound concept.  I like the fact that it&#39;s a ritual (i.e. meet these requirements and it&#39;ll work) rather than a roll.<br /><br />I&#39;ll try to take a look at the other specialists later this week.  I&#39;ll let you know if I can&#39;t find them.</p>

        <p>Thanks <span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink" href="https://plus.google.com/102595580176380683252" oid="102595580176380683252">Jeremy Strandberg</a></span> I have drafts for Casters from each of the casting schools except Necromancy so far. I&#39;ll be posting them over time as I get the others fixed up. Will try to refrain from overwhelming the community with my playbooks all at once.<br /><br />I&#39;ll work on the wording for Contingency a bit more. It&#39;s a solid idea and harkens back to the days of olde. Thank you for the suggestion.</p>
