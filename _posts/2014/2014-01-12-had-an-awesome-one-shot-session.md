Had an AWESOME one-shot session with a mix of players. Might be pushing it into a campaign.

Got to run a one-shot for a total RPG newbie, a seasoned RPG GM (who wanted to know what Dungeon World was like), and his fiancee, who has gamed with him before. Respectively, they played Aranwe the elven Ranger, Hawke the human Fighter, and Rook the halfling Thief.
