Has anyone done work with a DW hexcrawl? How big do you make your hexes, and what rules for exploration and travel have you made?

        <p>One hex is one ration, or one day on my maps. Keeps everything flat and simple. I&#39;ve started using the Pathfinder Ultimate Campaign hexploration tables to generate terrain/features and like them so far.</p>

Do you have some hexes with terrain that takes longer to cross?</p>

Draw bigger gaps between steadings. Big bad world!</p>

        <p>Hmm, fair enough. I seem to recall you could also draw maps and make routes from point A to B, labeling them in days it takes to travel, even though travel time and distance didn&#39;t sync up. Was there a term for this type of map?</p>
