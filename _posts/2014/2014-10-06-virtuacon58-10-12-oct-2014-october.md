VIRTUACON: 10-12 Oct 2014<br /><br />October 10th marks the beginning of the best 3 days in virtual gaming. The event has 60 scheduled games, 18 panels and much more. The best part is you don&#39;t even have to leave your house to attend and enjoy all it has to offer! VirtuaCon utilizes G+ Hangouts and Roll20 (when VTT is needed) to facilitate all of the games and panels. Last year was blast this year will be even better!<br /><br />We highly encourage pickup gaming as well!Â <br /><br />G+ Community: <a href="https://plus.google.com/u/0/communities/109731066728042855503" class="ot-anchor">https://plus.google.com/u/0/communities/109731066728042855503</a><br /><br />Schedule of Events: <a href="http://www.rpggeek.com/thread/1240108/virtuacon-14-oct-10-12-2014-player-signup-and-sche" class="ot-anchor">http://www.rpggeek.com/thread/1240108/virtuacon-14-oct-10-12-2014-player-signup-and-sche</a><br /><br />Schedule (PDF): <a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/45934553/VC14_Events.pdf" class="ot-anchor">https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/45934553/VC14_Events.pdf</a><br /><br />VirtuaCon Wiki: <a href="http://www.rpggeek.com/wiki/page/Virtuacon14" class="ot-anchor">http://www.rpggeek.com/wiki/page/Virtuacon14</a>?<br /><br />Tech basics: <a href="http://www.rpggeek.com/wiki/page/Virtuacon_setup#" class="ot-anchor">http://www.rpggeek.com/wiki/page/Virtuacon_setup#</a>
