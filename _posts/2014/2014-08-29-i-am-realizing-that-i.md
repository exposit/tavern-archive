I am realizing that I need some filled out character sheets for one shots because too much time is being spent on character creation. Does anyone have character sheets already filled out that they can share? Just thought I would ask here before making them all myself.

        <p>I would probably just go ahead and make them yourself. They are so easy to make I think you would spend more time looking for premades than you would just making them<br /></p>
