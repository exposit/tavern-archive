Ok I watched Chris Perkins DM DnD next on youtube. Observations:<br />-No grid.<br />-Stat checks done with base base modifiers, not skill modifiers.<br />-Very narrative driven. In fact drama and awesomeness seemed to trump rules.<br /><br />Now I havent read the Next rules at all, but it seems DnD is moving back to its roots? <br /><br />Or am I wrong? I am somewhat stoked to get my hands in it.

        <p>What does this have to do with Dungeon World?</p>

        <p>I&#39;ve played Next for about 7 sessions now. It <b>can</b> support that kind of play, but it doesn&#39;t <b>prompt</b> that kind of play.<br /><br />Case in point: Friday night, in our pirate game, we spent 30 minutes of real time rolling Climb checks to just f-ing climb the rigging as part of our daily tasks.  Every one of us, including the monk (the MONK!) fell down from ~25 feet and took damage. Which we then slept off before our boarding action the following day. The consequences? Our cleric was down 1 spell.<br /><br />It wasn&#39;t completely the system&#39;s fault, and that kind of thing could have happened in a poorly run game of DW too. But DW&#39;s 7-9 results and GM moves and narrative triggers to the moves would have at least given us the prompts avoid that bullshit.<br /><br />D&amp;D Next won&#39;t get in your way very much if you and your group already play the way that Chris Perkins demonstrated. But it won&#39;t <b>get you there</b> the way DW does.</p>

        <p>I think dnd next is going to try and straddle different methodologies that appeal to a wider audience. want to handle it more narratively you can do that...want to have a battle grid and use tactics more like a board game you can do that too. how it will be executed...who knows.<br />The thing that makes me favor DW over DnD and most other games is the speed in which I can prepare for a game or get new players comfortable with the game. These days my time is limited and I don&#39;t have days and days to craft a adventure out with all the mechanics that some rpg&#39;s require, instead I can focus on the story and the narrative that is presented to the players.. It also has enough &quot;DnD-ness&quot; to it that I can easily relate DW to their past experiences and hit the ground running.</p>

        <p>I ran a camapign that straddled the last two public playtests packets. My group was not impressed with it, and end up switching things to 4th Edition for the last few sessions.<br /><br />Characters are severely restricted in their options: you pick one thing at level 2 or 3 that locks in the rest of the stuff you can pick for the rest of the game. I know they say they want to make character generation quicker, but even <i>Dungeon World</i> lets you make choices at every level.<br /><br />Magical healing seems pretty much mandatory.<br /><br />Monsters seemed to die without doing much of anything at all. Designinng new monsters was a pain, and key villains tended to die in a couple hits before they could do anything interesting, or really even threaten the party.<br /><br />The game works, I suppose, but nothing about it...excites me, I guess, and I see no advantage in playing it over previous editions or games. If I want fast and simple, I&#39;ll do Dungeon World. If I want more mechanical crunch, I&#39;ll do 4th Edition.</p>

        <p>Yes. In the Chris Perkins game I also thought the monsters were wusses...</p>

        <p>Yeah, it&#39;s kind of underwhelming in my experience. It&#39;s essentially just a slightly lighter 3E. That makes it <i>easier</i> to play narrative/narration heavy games, but it doesn&#39;t really do anything to <i>support</i> or <i>encourage</i> them like Dungeon World. (Or 13th Age, or anything else being released these days)<br /><br />Partly it&#39;s just hard to get excited about the fourth iteration of what&#39;s essentially the same ruleset (3.0 --&gt; 3.5 --&gt; Pathfinder --&gt; 5E), but it really just seems like they&#39;re applying effort to the wrong parts of the game to effect meaningful change. And even the parts they are changing they&#39;re limiting to the tiniest of tweaks. In terms of sports aphorisms, they&#39;re really playing to not-lose rather than playing to win, and the result is as expected -- timid, flaccid, and disappointing all around.</p>

        <p>I know some people complain about how grid-heavy and balanced 4th Edition is, but frankly I felt that the rules were tight and elegant enough that I knew exactly where to bend and break them to get precisely the amount of tension I wanted, as well as how to houserule it so that I did not inadvertently &quot;break&quot; it.<br /><br />Plus, the last two campaigns I ran were <i>entirely</i> off the grid, and it was incredibly easy to run and manage the game.</p>

        <p>Since 1996 I played AD&amp;D2, D&amp;D3/3.5 and D&amp;D4E and liked every new edition more than previous one. Not interested in Next &#39;cause it&#39;s not new, but &quot;going back to roots&quot;. Thanks, but if need to go back to those roots I have tons of books already. Give me something new or don&#39;t waste my time (I say it to WotC not the OP :)).</p>

        <p>There was a Legends and Lore article about the &quot;Basic D&amp;D&quot; rules that will probably make up the starter set box.<br /><br /><a href="https://www.wizards.com/DnD/Article.aspx?x=dnd/4ll/20130114" class="ot-anchor">https://www.wizards.com/DnD/Article.aspx?x=dnd/4ll/20130114</a><br /><br />No skills (though classes may get bonuses for specific ability checks), no feats, non-modifiable builds of the core classes that express the &quot;iconic&quot; version of those classes.<br />This sounds like what you&#39;re describing.</p>
