        <p>I really like this theme. Can you give us a preview of the main mechanics? </p>

        <p>Most of the moves for the class come from use of a currency called pox. The character absorbs negative effects to gain pox. They then expend the pox to inflict debilities and other restrictions on others.<br /><br />There is also a bit of healing, diagnosing ailments, a built in defense (as many moves require touch), and beneficial interactions with communities of the diseased or disabled. </p>

        <p>Yeah, the theme is awesome, but we didn&#39;t have any drafts, we need some additional information.</p>

        <p><b>Starting Moves</b><br /><i>A Pox Be Upon You</i><br />You have the ability to spread the diseases you have healed in others. If you can get your<br />bodily fluid upon the target, whether spit, blood, or otherwise, spend 1 pox to either:<br />• Inflict a debility<br />• Inflict damage<br />• Inflict Spasms - the next time the target inflicts damage, roll twice and take the lowest<br />result<br />• Inflict Cramps - you and your allies get +1 forward to your next action against the target<br /><br />After you spend the pox, roll+INT. *On a 10+, choose 1. *On a 7-9, choose 2:<br />• It leaves you momentarily open to retaliation<br />• The target has a strong immune system - spend 1 additional pox<br />• The action required more effort than you expected - suffer -1 forward to your next roll<br />• The pox is particularly virulent - your allies suffer -1 ongoing to resist disease until they<br />have a chance to rest<br /><br /><i>Consume Ailment</i><br />By touching a target you can remove 1 debility from them. You gain 1 pox in this way.<br /><br /><i>Shroud of Fear</i><br />Because of your diseased appearance, intelligent creatures are reluctant to attack you. roll+CON. *On a hit, you get +1 ongoing to Defy Danger against their hostile actions for<br />the rest of the encounter. *On a 10+, the first time you suffer harm this encounter, mark<br />experience.<br /><br /><i>Communal Effort</i><br />You are shunned for your appearance and spend most days with communities of the<br />disabled and diseased. You are able to Carouse with these communities without having to<br />expend coin.</p>

        <p>A few questions, this class would require the GM handling out a lot more debilities then usual yes? And it could heal a debility, inflicted by hunger or magic and turn it into its own disease storage?﻿<br /><br />When do you roll shroud of fear?﻿<br /><br />When you don&#39;t spend coin to carouse, what are you rolling with?</p>

        <p>I would caution using too many debilities. As it could break the class by making it too powerful. Though some who don&#39;t use standard -1 debilities would have a tough time with this playbook. <br /><br />And yes, the character&#39;s touch alleviates the effects of the hunger (not necessarily fixing the problem of being hungry), and uses that stored negative energy to afflict others with hindering effects.</p>

        <p>But the class is fully dependent (At first at least) of the GM handing out debilities. So if the group just stays out of danger you basically have no &quot;class feature&quot;?</p>

        <p>Oh and I should add that they class can gain moves to start to spread the debilities, slowly generating more &quot;ammunition&quot; as it would be.</p>

That&#39;s only a possibility though, I get motivated by weird things.<br /><br />For the future I&#39;m considering a Warden (good at Defying Danger and Defending, not so great for damage output) and an Inspirational Hero (nice to have around for forwards based off an &#39;ego&#39; currency). Maybe a Witch Hunter if there&#39;s not one out there (almost as good at killing as it is at condemning everything to death).<br /><br />Any or all of them may suck and get canned though, we&#39;ll see how they go.</p>

I expect you mean that they are for &#39;rounding out&#39; a party? Still, I think you&#39;ve sold me on the Afflictionist: it sounds like it will take some creativity to play it, which is appealing. And there are enough glamour vampires around, right?</p>

We feel that success rocks just that much more when it wasn&#39;t guaranteed from the start.&quot;  I like giving material that can lead to some fun stories that may not always work out great for the character.  Leaves some room to grow outside of just experience points.<br /><br />I hope you enjoy the Afflictionist and can give me some input on the classes to come.</p>
