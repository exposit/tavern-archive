<b>Demon in the shadows</b> compendium class<br /><br /><b>The summoning</b><br />When you <b>summon a shadow dragon into you</b>, your flesh and bones are transformed into shadow dragon flesh and bones. You now possess the body of the shadow dragon, even if its mind still fights you.<br /><br /><b>Demonic possession</b><br />When you <b>possess the body of the shadow dragon</b>, you are its demon and use its body as your own. Now when you trigger a move, before you roll say how you:<br />• breathe darkness upon a foe<br />• command slaves<br />• take and hoard all the gold and jewels<br />• kidnap someone<br />• rip and tear with savage claws<br />• strike from the sky.<br />For each option you describe in fitting detail, the group may grant you +1 to your roll. Then make your roll as normal. Do as the move instructs, but on a 10+, you also subdue the dragon. On a 7-9, one of the shadow dragon’s impulses is too strong; the GM gains one hold to activate an impulse. On a miss, there&#39;s trouble, double trouble.<br /><br />When the GM <b>spends hold to activate an impulse: terrify, hoard, mock, butcher, betray</b>, the shadow dragon regains control of its body for a moment. The GM will tell you what unwelcome things it does. <br /><br /><b>Darkness</b><br />When you <b>gain Darkness</b>, the GM will tell you to roll 1d4 or more. Add that to any Darkness you already gained. <br /><br />When you <b>have Darkness equal to half your Charisma</b>, the GM gets 2 hold when you get a 7-9 on <b>Demonic possession</b>. <br /><br />When you <b>have Darkness equal to your Charisma</b>, the shadow dragon breaks free from your possession.<br /><br /><b>Fronts</b><br />Add to Grim Portents of Danger: Shadow Dragon<br />– The shadow dragon breaks free from its possession.

        <p>I am also not 100% clear how this works. When I hack slash by breathing shadow I get +1 to the roll?</p>

        <p>Yeah, that was the idea. To help motivate shadow dragon behaviour. <br /><br />Maybe the options should be even more outcome-focused, like butcher the helpless with claws, breathe darkness on the powerless and hear their terror?</p>

        <p>Instead of a Danger/countdown, what about having it so that each time you call upon the shadow dragon&#39;s power, you gain a variable amount of Darkness (say, 1d4, or more on a miss), and when it equals your Charisma or Wisdom then the dragon consumes you?</p>

        <p>I vote the GM controls the dragon on 7-9. It is an NPC after all.</p>

        <p>I have used other mechanics were 9- gets you a kind hold that the GM can spend to make you do stuff. <br /><br />Like, for Sundered World cultists can use magic that gives them Madness, which the GM can spend to make them attack a player, stop and babble incoherently, or even have an eldritch horror pop out of them.</p>

        <p>Thanks. I am thinking of writing a blog post on some good core mechanics to use for certain types of moves, if for nothing else to make it easier for people to make playbooks and such.</p>

Activating an impulse means the dragon is essentially in control for a moment. That could mean initiating unwelcome actions or changing the execution or effect of an action in unwelcome ways. So the dragon destroys the bridge the other PCs are crossing (impulse: betray); attacks not just the party&#39;s foes but everyone (impulse: butcher); or instead of helping them gather their loot, it takes it all flies off with it (impulse: hoard).<br /><br />Your idea of being consumed by darkness is nice. I have a few other ideas for what the dragon breaking free of possession means, but I&#39;ll definitely consider yours when I have to make the call. <br /><br />Your Darkness countdown is quite nice, making the dragon&#39;s powers a more limited resource than just on a miss. One thing this makes me think of is making the Bard&#39;s player  track the countdown, so they now exactly how far they are from losing their powerful host.</p>

        <p>I used a Fungus countdown in the updated <i>Something Stirs in the Blackscale Brakes</i> to represent you slowly becoming weaker and weaker over time as fungus spores killed you off (in this case, it was when Fungus = hp).<br /><br />I felt it was very simple to track, and have been using it for other kind of conditions tracks (like Stone for being petrified, Poison for being poisoned, Corruption, Hunger for my ghoul playbook, etc).<br /><br />I have not had a chance to use it in play much, so if you <i>do</i> use it, I would be interested to hear how easy/fun it was, also if it played well with the fiction and such.</p>

        <p>Sounds good,<span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink" href="https://plus.google.com/117134143142507309944" oid="117134143142507309944">David Guyll</a></span>. That style countdown also lends itself to other effects; like if Darkness is have your Charisma, then *trigger a move&quot; activates two impulses on a 7-9. <br /><br />I really need a better name than <b>trigger a move</b> for that move. Maybe something about power and control. Hmmm.</p>
