Hey all,<br /><br />My group and I have been recording our play sessions and are going to start pod casting them (along with some discussion) and I would love to share it with you all. We (I) only have one episode up for now, but more to follow very soon.<br /><br />I would love comments and feedback, though we are pretty much an insulated and homegrown group of role-players and I am learning pod casting as I go, so be gentle :)

        <p>Just finished listening to it and I seriously enjoyed it. I try to look for gaming groups to watch or listen to but, they are usually boring. You guys had such great energy and enthusiasm that I like and I could feel your personalities which is what I look for. A person needs to find a connection and I found it with you guys. I can&#39;t wait for more episodes and being new to podcasting it sounded decent to me.</p>

        <p>It&#39;s a well established fact that Jareds are excellent at Dungeon World. Your podcast was inevitable.</p>

        <p>What is your recording setup? We tried recording our last session, and it ended up very low quality, and you can hardly hear anyone.</p>
