Finally the timing is right and I will be able to start up my Dark Sun based DW campaign with my local group.  <br /><br />This will also be my first ongoing DW game and thus will get more use out of the bonds and such.   I thought I would ask the group and brainstorm a bit on some custom bonds that would have a connection to Dark Sun. <br /><br />Thoughts and ideas?

        <p>I would definitely be interested in hearing more about how this game goes for your group. I have a game group that really likes Dark Sun and have been playing Dungeon World for a little while now.</p>

        <p>It also seems that there are possibilities for custom moves and/or modifications from existing moves.</p>
