House Rule of the day: Defy Danger +DEX in my game now reads: &quot;...by moving quickly, quietly or carefully&quot; to explicitly cover more of the traditional DEX tasks.

        <p>So here is the greatly sought after stealth move...</p>

        <p>A lot of people do this to cover stealth.  <span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink" href="https://plus.google.com/110937611143261107555" oid="110937611143261107555">Kasper Brohus Allerslev</a></span>&#39;s write-up on the subject really makes the argument for making stealth a roleplay opportunity though, and I definitely see his point.  Going to try his suggestions in my game this Saturday, as stealth almost always enters the game.</p>

        <p>Doesn&#39;t stealth mean to move both unseen and unheard? The moment one is seen, stealth is no longer an issue.  I haven&#39;t played enough DW to decide how to resolve it, but stealth resolution seems to be more wed to the fiction. A roll may be needed to defy danger when one pushes the limits of safely using stealth. </p>

        <p>I knew this would re-open the hornet&#39;s nest, but I thought the description of the three applications of DEX better encompassed the other two descriptions in the book:<br /><br /><b>Quickly</b> covers the most obvious interpretation of getting out of the way/acting fast; dodging, running, flipping, etc. If the blow with the sword was quick, maybe it could disarm the club-wielding ogre. Fiction first! Identical stat means the &quot;carefully&quot; statement +Tim Franzke teased me with is the same resolution, even if the player needs to describe it better.<br /><br /><b>Carefully</b> covers balance and being nimble/deft enough to not leave tracks or bump into /destroy things around you.<br /><br /><b>Quietly</b> covers being so dexterous that you control your body and don&#39;t let it be the cause of your discovery.<br /><br /><span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink" href="https://plus.google.com/102953378950954656315" oid="102953378950954656315">Fr. Tom</a></span> is absolutely right! Staying out of sight is a factor, and someone noted that holding your breath underwater to not make noisy bubbles would instead be CON. That is why I don&#39;t think this covers all Stealth, but the examples of stealth and balance in the book didn&#39;t have enough representation in the move description, especially for the literal-minded among us.<br /><br />My proposal is to use this alternate description of the Defy Danger +DEX move for players who can&#39;t grok it without being explicit.</p>

        <p>PS: The comma and the &quot;or&quot; mean it could be any of the three. I can&#39;t see a more appropriate stat for those three reasonably separate actions.</p>

        <p>Again, there&#39;s no right or wrong answer in my book.  I have used DD at times, and this weekend I&#39;ll try it Kasper&#39;s way.  I think it comes down to what works best at your table, full stop.</p>

        <p>Use both the mechanical move and/or the fiction as the situation demands. The more tools you have the better you&#39;ll play.</p>
