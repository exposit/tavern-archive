DW Hack to share, for one-shot play and to actually get to play high level moves.<br /><br />Changes:<br />1. At the end of a scene, if you have marked XP or feel you should from alignment and standard end-of-session questions, level and reduce xp by one.<br /><br />2. Stats: Start with 18, 17, 16, 15, 13, 10 . When you level, do <b>not</b> increase a stat.<br /><br />3. Debilities: You are playing ancient adventures, and have all 6 debilities. Group these into 2 or 3 &quot;afflictions&quot;, which are ailments you have - gout, necromantic arm falling off, and an evil deity speaking to you were all used.<br /><br />4. Liberal use of magic items - i wrote up a bunch, and put them in a sack. When they were at a point where they&#39;d get equipment, draw from the sack - I did one draw per player. This included plenty of potions of remove affliction, and rings of physical health.  At least one of these was &quot;make something up&quot;, and another couple were &quot;pick something from the book&quot;. <br /><br />5. Moves: ignore the 2-6, 6-10 split, as you are veterans who are relearning.<br /><br />This made for fast leveling, and leveling was easier than normal. One character ended at 7th level. <br /><br />It worked well for what it was - a gonzo, no-prep, quick, fun version of dungeon world designed for a one-shot.
