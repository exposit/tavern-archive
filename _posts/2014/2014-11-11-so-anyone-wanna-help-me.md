So, anyone wanna help me test the NCFOK beta rules via a Hangouts one-shot tomorrow (i.e., Wednesday)? I&#39;m off all day, so timing can be whenever, though I&#39;ll probably assume evening-time for the U.S. crowd as a default.<br /><br />I&#39;d be running, and I&#39;d like to shoot for about a four hour session so we can get a full rules exploration in and still get a complete and proper game session out of it.
