I&#39;ve been working on a Weaponsmithing Compendium Class, for one of my players who wants to do a lot of forging special weapons and the like.<br /><br />I&#39;m interested in any suggestions for additions or improvement that anyone has, particularly for more tags to add to the massive list of magical weapon tags I&#39;ve got so far. Can&#39;t ever have too many ideas for magical weapons, after all.<br /><br /><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1T0EIddICxNidM6o5MAYhAraYJuMI3sMxUUGjFqBQ3EE/edit?usp=sharing" class="ot-anchor">https://docs.google.com/document/d/1T0EIddICxNidM6o5MAYhAraYJuMI3sMxUUGjFqBQ3EE/edit?usp=sharing</a>

        <p>Under <i>Heft of the Blade</i> does the question <b>What damage does it do?</b> essentially mean <b>What tags does it have?</b> or would this reveal the damage die of the (N)PC wielding it?<br /><br /><i>Insight Of The Anvil</i> seems very powerful. Then again, I&#39;m not sure how often this situation would arise. If it was often I would consider using a list of choices here. If it doesn&#39;t happen often, I think this is pretty cool =).<br /><br />I&#39;m not sure how many people would ever willingly choose <i>Driven Retribution</i>. It seems like it would rarely come up in play and the hit you take for having this intense focus seems pretty big. I don&#39;t like this one very well.<br /><br /><i>Fateweaver</i> and <i>Forgemaster</i> seem quite similar. Could you explain how these are different from one another? <i>Forgemaster</i> in particular seems quite vague.<br /><br />I love the tag list and I dig the magic items. Overall a pretty awesome CC. Well done! Do you have plans to work on any other smith CCs? Perhaps an Armorsmith?</p>

        <p>Thanks for the critiques! They&#39;re very helpful.<br /><br /><i>Heft of the Blade</i> was partially inspired by the fighter move <i>Eye for Weaponry</i>. It might be better if it was more explicit about revealing mechanics like tags or damage-die, but I didn&#39;t want to overshadow the Fighter move. Probably be better to commit to one way or other other.<br /><br />I have no idea how often <i>Insight of the Anvil</i> will come up in play; I&#39;d love to see it playtested since I haven&#39;t had the chance yet. One downside is that the weapon now has a declared weakness if you get it back, but it might be better written as &quot;The first time you face...&quot;<br /><br /><i>Forgemaster</i> is meant to be open-ended; it&#39;s basically a slightly-structured way to add a custom move to a weapon. As such, its a bit vague, perhaps too much so. <br /><br /><i>Fateweaver</i> is supposed to be explicitly about giving an object an inescapable geas, inspired by Irish and Norse legends and the wish-magic in C.J.Cherryh&#39;s <i>Rusalka</i>. Probably can rewrite the trigger to make that a bit clearer.<br /><br /><i>Driven Retribution</i> would probably be better as it&#39;s own compendium class, since it&#39;s works on a pretty narrow set of character circumstances. A better replacement would probably be something that reflects how some legendary smiths were forced to make swords against their will.</p>

        <p>Updated compendium class! Better wording! <b>More tags!</b><br /><br /><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1u8a5IHT3X_1_yIXREO6pDqKDy47mNzV8qc2NafSY7aQ/edit?usp=sharing" class="ot-anchor">https://docs.google.com/document/d/1u8a5IHT3X_1_yIXREO6pDqKDy47mNzV8qc2NafSY7aQ/edit?usp=sharing</a></p>

        <p>this is really cool! You might have enough to make a full playbook. What if you combined this with the gladiator class? Or combined it with another compendium class?</p>

        <p>There&#39;s certainly enough legends out there to provide inspiration for a full playbook, but I want to make sure I&#39;ve got enough solid material first. If I do, there are more blacksmithing aspects that can be reflected, like shoeing horses and repairing tools. Playtesting is encouraged.</p>

        <p>holy sh!t, I just finished going through all the tags! you MIGHT have too many. it&#39;s almost incomprehensible. Maybe group them into categories?</p>

        <p>You can never have too many tags!<br /><br />Actually, I was thinking of at least alphabetizing them. I just keep coming up with more tags. Compiling an organized list probably deserves to be a separate project.</p>

        <p>I agree with <span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink" href="https://plus.google.com/116124411286229550721" oid="116124411286229550721">David Schirduan</a></span>. Organization when you have that much information is always a plus. I&#39;ll love your CC either way, but it wouldn&#39;t hurt. Though if it comes down to it, I&#39;d rather see more tags than a shorter but organized list ^_-<br /><br /><span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink" href="https://plus.google.com/105946087652149391485" oid="105946087652149391485">Isaac Karth</a></span> I like what you&#39;ve done with <i>Heft of the Blade</i>.<br /><br />I personally prefer seeing a different approach to <i>Insight of the Anvil</i>. The weakness could be a reflection of the weaponsmiths knowledge of weaponry rather than a weakness of the weapon generated during its manufacturing. Perhaps the move allows you to more easily disarm or otherwise circumvent the weapon. Maybe this gives you +1 forward or allows you to pick some sort of weakness or opening you&#39;ll be able to exploit from a list of opportunities. I hate the idea that as a weaponsmith I have to admit I made a boo-boo to get the upper hand. My weapons should always be EPIC =D</p>
