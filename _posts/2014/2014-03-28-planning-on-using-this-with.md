Planning on using this with the core classes in order to start a DW campaign locally. I have other scraps of ideas put together in the fashion of a newspaper. I&#39;m hoping to expand on these after the first game.<br /><br />Fantasy set on a Western backdrop.

        <p>The steampunk western setting seems cool, but... does the stealing farmer&#39;s daughters have to be a thing? Rape as a plot device/signifier of True Villainy is getting preeetty tired.</p>

I&#39;m sorry, that was really insensitive of me. <br /><br />I&#39;ve been thinking of all the folks involved, a runaway farmers daughter, a sensationalist telegrapher, the isolated town, a motorcycle gang and a protective father.﻿<br /><span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink" href="https://plus.google.com/107884809880302331625" oid="107884809880302331625">Linda Larsson</a></span></p>

That wasn&#39;t my argument at all. Simply that these are thieves, robbers and murderers, and there&#39;s quite enough to motivate player characters to want to hunt them down without throwing in &quot;oh and they&#39;re rapists too!&quot; Rape is a topic that should be handled with a lot more sensitivity in media than it usually is - and definitely not something to throw into what should be a lighthearted fun game, because that would quickly make it NOT fun for a lot of people.</p>

        <p>Well, half-orcs have to come from somewhere. On the other hand, I have always felt that making &quot;good&quot; orcs be half-human was a terrible idea. But usually when I hear that thieves &quot;steal daughters&quot; in fantasy, it usually means they offer the girls are leaving willingly because they get a chance to run away from a prearranged life.<br />But I suppose tiat isn&#39;t possible because they are ugly and brutish. But if it were a band of elves accused of that, no one would think rape. I think goblins can get away with stealing children, because the G-rated implication is that they want the small humans to come be goblins with them.<br />It is certainly possible that in a traditional society though, young men would fight the orcs and young women would surrender, meaning the orcs are just enslaving the humans that surrender or holding them for ransom. But maybe &quot;kidnapping their families&quot; would imply that better.</p>

It has been true in nearly all human societies until very, very recently when firearms have become so very advanced that having a size or strength disadvantage doesn&#39;t amount to much and birth control is so readily available that women don&#39;t spend much of their lives pregnant.<br />And seriously?... Psychologically?... When violence occurs around them, how often do women engage in it compared to men? I have seen men, even groups of men, beating the hell out of one another for absolutely no discernible reason half a dozen times-- never seen women do it outside an internet video and even then it is usually two quite overweight ones who flail around pretty ineffectively.<br />Furthermore, if a man were to EVER just give up and surrender and submit to a mob threatening violence against him, unless he were disabled or elderly, he would no doubt be labeled an unfit man and hardly worth mentioning. Women, however, are not judged harshly for choosing such action.</p>

        <p>There&#39;s another issue that I was trying to address within this game, and you can&#39;t really talk about the west without it, which is race. I&#39;ve been trying to wrap my head around this on how to hit it. My friend  suggested that I allow this to take an active role instead of trying to sweep it under the rug.</p>

        <p>If you bring race and &quot;stealing women....&quot; well, could you just not? So much to unpack there. One issue at a time.</p>

        <p><span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink" href="https://plus.google.com/103699641805524197246" oid="103699641805524197246">Tony Scinta III</a></span> I think it&#39;s very easy, as a creator, to underestimate how obvious one needs to be. If you&#39;ve ever GMed and offered the players what you thought was an obvious clue only to have them go haring off in completely the wrong direction, you know what I mean =)<br /><br />When it comes to matters of gender, race, sexuality etc. in RPGs, I think it&#39;s particularly wise to try to avoid ambiguity... because sadly, our hobby (like society in general) is pretty well steeped in unexamined prejudices. If you want the victims of prejudice to trust you not to be the kind of person who&#39;d exploit their situation for cheap drama, or try to pass it off as &quot;just the way the world is&quot;, you&#39;re going to want to be pretty damn obvious that that&#39;s not what&#39;s going on here.<br /><br />(Let&#39;s not even go into how far you&#39;d have to hammer the point home to get it across to people who&#39;re unaware of their own prejudice.)<br /><br />As for this in particular... maybe &quot;kidnapping and brainwashing&quot; if you meant to imply that the girl(s) had joined the gang rather than been victims? I at least would get a very different association from that than &quot;stealing away&quot;. Still not necessarily a positive one, but not in a &quot;oh god, yet another rape-as-plot-device scenario&quot; way. Also, as someone said upthread, perhaps say &quot;children&quot; rather than girls specifically?<br /><br />When it comes to race, I have one very earnest piece of advice for you. If you want to explore racism in fantasy, do so in the context of racism between HUMANS. Trying to make analogies with fantasy races, whether it&#39;s humans being racist toward orcs or elves being racist toward humans, is very, very fraught. It&#39;s super easy to end up with the implication that victims of racism are literally nonhuman - or that the perpetrators of racism are, which is just as false, because racism isn&#39;t just the KKK. The really poisonous thing about any kind of prejudice is that it&#39;s damn near impossible to grow up in a prejudiced society and not internalize some of that crap - even if you&#39;re a decent person who believes in equality, it&#39;s highly likely you&#39;ll get tripped up sometimes!<br /><br />In closing, you may want to look at this link: <a href="http://gomakemeasandwich.wordpress.com/2014/03/25/a-conversation-with-ron-edwards-about-circle-of-hands-and-rape-long/" class="ot-anchor">http://gomakemeasandwich.wordpress.com/2014/03/25/a-conversation-with-ron-edwards-about-circle-of-hands-and-rape-long/</a> It&#39;s a discussion of rape in RPGs between Anna Kreider and Ron Edwards, and even if I personally don&#39;t agree 100% with either of them, some interesting things get said.</p>

This is invaluable information, especially when I start to branch out from running a home game into running at cons. <br /><br />While I&#39;ve played for years, this is one of my first times as a Gm. The players that I have in the game have been friends for years. While I trusted that my group would get the hint, I didn&#39;t realize how it would look to the general populous. <br /><br />As for race, my plan wasn&#39;t to draw an analog, but to capitolize on fear of the unknown. Once again, looks bad from the outside.<br /><br />Any links you can provide on these subjects would be very helpful, I&#39;ve already pushed the other links in the thread to my kindle. Very informed reading.</p>

        <p>I also thought it was a huge leap to jump from &quot;stealing away farmer&#39;s daughters&quot; to &quot;rape&quot;.  My first thought was &quot;enslavement and menial work, I mean, have you ever tasted the dinners the Oark&#39;s make (female or male)....<br />  VILE!  No spices, not even salt. And, ughhh, boiled okra with every meal. Now, these farmers&#39; daughters... they know how to cook. Paprika, cinnamon, garlic? These are just the start of their savory, amazing, cooking.  Plus, add the threat of a whip and the floors are scrubbed immaculate.  They&#39;re about the size of an adolescent Oark and eat less than half of one.  Sure, you have daughters, farmer, I think you have plenty, probably won&#39;t miss one of &#39;em.  And by the time she&#39;s outlived her usefulness she&#39;ll probably be too tough to eat, so, let her go and grab another.&quot;<br /><br />Second thought took me to something similar to &quot;the wolf problem&quot;. Someone in town (the farmer) is an ass. Hates everyone. Children hate him.  His children hate him. His daughter runs away and tells no one. He doesn&#39;t like the Oarks (of course), sees they&#39;ve done some bad stuff as of late and figures he can blame the runaway daughter on them.  Through the course of their adventure, the<br />PCs figure out the truth.  Or even worse, they figure out the farmer actually killed his own daughter. <br /><br />That&#39;s what came to my head before it got dragged down to rape. </p>

        <p>John, the answer to &quot;this is a problem&quot; is not &quot;I don&#39;t see a problem.&quot; That&#39;s your privilege blinders operating. Take them off, and <b>listen</b> to us, and maybe you will understand <b>why</b> it&#39;s a problem.<br /><br />Tony: thank you for listening and understanding. Your lack of defensiveness when it&#39;s been raised speaks highly to your sensitivity for a problem that affects waaay too many people in this world.</p>

        <p>For whom is it okay for the Oarks to steal away?  Is it only women that get raped by Oarks? What do the Oarks do with children and men? Maybe Oarks like the soft tender bottoms of men?</p>

        <p>So claiming everyone is getting raped makes it acceptable? It&#39;s not necessary to include it to convey the villainy of this band, so why include it?<br /><br />If actually being assaulted in hand to hand combat was a fairly common occurrence for your half of the population and you actually had friends or relatives who had been killed in hand to hand combat, you probably would feel uncomfortable and ostracized when a game focuses on it or makes light of it.<br /><br />You don&#39;t deal with the likely potential of your soft tender bottom being violated on a regularly basis. Expand your perspective.</p>

        <p>You know nothing of my situation so make no assumptions.  I never said rape was acceptable for anyone.  Just felt it was a leap to assume that someone being kidnapped assumed rape, especially when the kidnapper was from a different family of creatures in a wildly imaginary world. [end]</p>

It&#39;s not as though things happen in a context, or that &quot;orcs enslave and rape human women&quot; has been a trope of fantasy gaming since the first edition of D&amp;D felt the need to explain where little half-orcs come from.<br /><br />Okay, so that was sarcastic, but honestly. Tony expressed himself poorly, or at least in a way that&#39;s really easy to misinterpret when you consider the contexts of popular culture and of RPGs. He&#39;s admitted this, explained what he actually meant (which sounds cool for the record) and said he&#39;ll try to be clearer in future. All is good, so why do you feel the need to come in at the tail end of the discussion and tell us that because YOU would&#39;ve drawn a different conclusion (though still one based on those women being enslaved...) there was nothing wrong to start with?</p>
