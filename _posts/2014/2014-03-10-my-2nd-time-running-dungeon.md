My 2nd time running Dungeon World was a test run of Gamma World using this engine. My players love the freeform combat and simple rolls way more than playing a d20 game.<br /><br />Some Highlights I wanted to share:<br />-A road warrior who uses a metal boomerang, a great way to use a &quot;Returning Weapon&quot; tag. Though the consequences come when it lands way off or he has to catch it in midair.<br />-A Cyborg who has an awesome custom-move laser beam attack. It does very low of damage if it doesn&#39;t hit exactly, plus it needs to recharge for a few hours.<br />-A mad scientist who rolled snake-eyes trying to use a freeze ray. It pretty much exploded in his face and froze him in a block of ice.<br />-A group of psionic Archivists (Who basically worship machines) convinces the cyborg to ride with them after combusting the nearby bandits into ash.<br /><br />I&#39;m having a bit of a problem figuring out how I want Radiation to play out (besides just using Defy Danger, which I could), any suggestions?

        <p>You could use tokens, and make a custom move that  subtracts the number of the tokens from the roll when the activation of the move is met.</p>

        <p>When you <b>are exposed to radiation</b>, roll+CON. * On a 10+, choose one. *On a 7-9, choose both:<br />*Gain a debility. If you cannot gain a debility, gain 1d4 radiation,.<br />*Gain 1d4 radiation.<br /><br />Your maximum hit points are reduced by your radiation. When you <b>make camp</b>, reduced your radiation by 1d4.<br /><br />Items like rad-X could reduce the radiation you gain, and items could simply reduce your radiation. Some things could increase the radiation you gain, and monsters could force you to gain radiation (like ghouls).</p>

        <p>No prob! I just realized that I was channeling <i>Fallout</i>, what with the rad-X and ghouls...too early. &gt;_&lt;</p>

        <p>I&#39;m more of a fan of Borderlands (in terms of inspiration) myself, but I&#39;ve played Fallout. The Bounty Hunter/Warrior character was based on the game Rage (with the metal boomerang weapon).</p>

        <p>Mmm, can you tell about the changes to the gamma world system? I thought about the hack, but haven&#39;t come up with anything good so far.  </p>

        <p>The interesting thing about the first edition of gamma world is that it actually used a &quot;move&quot; system in a way, with separate modes for traveling, searching, and ect. so there&#39;s not much to change.<br /><br />I added Mental Attack and Mental Defense Stats that (as per the gw rules) gain experience as they are used. So basically MA is used instead of Wis for Psion attacks, and MD can avoid/deflect the same sort of attacks. <br /><br />I added that discovering and/or identifying any piece of advanced technology earns 1xp. <br /><br />I also added some classes/abilities from Dungeon Planet and use that as a general guideline for certain things.<br /><br />I use weapon damage instead of class damage since It makes stronger weapons have more value (though, I use this rule in general but I still try to keep the values low...the freeze ray went from 2d8 in GW to 1d6 + 1 for example)<br /><br />I don&#39;t track rations in most of my games, especially here, because in my mind it would cause the players to die too quickly in this sort of setting. I make the general assumption that they have enough to survive. <br /><br />I added a straightforward move for identifying technology to simplify it, but I decided I might use the flow charts as a possible &quot;mini-game&quot; as in &quot;protect the hacker while he works to disable the computer&quot; while he rolls on the chart during his move.<br /><br />I also made psionics and magic have wild unpredictable affects (ie: using a Wild Mage) if not controlled perfectly due to the wackiness of the world.</p>

        <p>Oh, the first edition... I only played the last one, with it&#39;s weird character creation system</p>

        <p>I do have the 7th edition, but I am mostly using it for resources (powers, omega tech, ect.) and I used the grid maps to give a visual of one place. </p>

        <p>7th Edition could be fun in Dungeon World, with each origin being like, half a playbook.</p>

        <p>The bounty hunter is using a variety of mixed playbooks, while the cyborg is a Golem from Inverse World.<br />I mixed together a Ranger with a bit of rouge and battlebabe, plus a bounty hunter from 7th edition that was in the expansions. </p>
