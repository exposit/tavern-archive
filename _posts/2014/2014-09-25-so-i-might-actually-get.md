So, I might actually get to play as a regular player instead of the GM starting with our next Man Day. I&#39;ve not been a regular player in, like, years. Leaning toward a bard. (Possible name: Romeo Capistrano de Amoro). I&#39;m also tickled by the Fool, but I&#39;m not sure the GM would go for that. (Note to +Adrien Thoen, who wrote the Fool class: There&#39;s a wacky amount of errors in grammar, et cetera, in the PDF.)<br /><br />Decisions, decisions, decisions.

        <p>If you have the ability to bring a real instrument go bard. Everybody loves/hates that guy depending on how good you are.</p>

        <p>Bard is solid. I also like the &quot;new&quot; bard that was recently posted here (I forget who created it but I&#39;m sure they&#39;ll chime in). But my experience has been that Thief is the most fun if you don&#39;t want thews or magic.</p>

        <p>I almost always play a thief, a fighter, or some combination of the two. A bard would be a change of pace. A wizard would be a real change of pace. Must mull. :)</p>

        <p>Wizard can be a lot of fun but pick your spells wisely. Mage is a little more flexible if your GM is cool with it. Immolator is my favorite magic using class. You can also really easily reskin it to another element.Â </p>
