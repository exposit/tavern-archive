From tonight&#39;s DW game. Yusuf is a shapechanger (Druid playbook), Gorm is an Island Dwarf, on the mainland seeking mercenary work. He met up with Yusuf, thinking Yusuf was a scrawny little guy, but funny. Yusuf heard the voice of the spirits/djinn telling him to stick with Gorm, <i>something</i> was going to be happening.<br /><br />They&#39;re investigating the days-old scene of a caravan ambush, trying to figure out who did it (and took the strongbox the Alchemist&#39;s Guild wants). Yusuf is very perceptive, finding the blinds the ambushers used, and the remnants of footprints. Gorm is...imagining how he would have <i>totally</i> defeated the ambushers, jumping from wagon to wagon cleaving skulls, as he daydreams. Yusuf shifts into a dog to gain the animal&#39;s olfactory sharpness, out of sight of Gorm, but his investigations take him in front of the daydreaming barbarian...<br /><br />&quot;Hey, where did this dog come from? Yusuf!&quot;<br />The dog stops, turns and looks at Gorm.<br />&quot;Yusuf...Yusuf, it&#39;s staring at me. I think it&#39;s enchanted, or something.&quot;<br />Gorm loosens his axe.<br />Yusuf rolls his eyes, and sighs. &quot;Really, Gorm?&quot;<br />&quot;Yusuf <i>it knows my name</i>...&quot;<br /><br />(In Gorm&#39;s defense, Yusuf hadn&#39;t mentioned the whole shapeshifter bit yet...)

        <p>Though his name is Gorm, you could say he is... gormless! </p>
