Which  is the best choice (qualitywise) for the print edition of Class Warfare in EU, Lulu or DriveThruRPG?

        <p>I <i>believe</i> Lulu is better quality, but DTRPG includes the PDF in the deal.</p>

        <p>Is there a difference between Lulu printing in the US and EU?<br />(If not, Lulu is better than DriveThruRPG).</p>

        <p>I have read they use the same printing service, but that may no longer be the case.</p>

        <p>LULU has better quality but is most likely more expansive because<br />a) The DTRPG option includes the PDF<br />b) Lulu shipping is more expensive for EU customers (DTRPG ships from GB but I think LULU ships exclusively from USA)</p>

        <p>LULU has offices both in France and UK, I think when I ordered last time I received the book from France, I should find the paper invoice to check. Priority mail to Italy without tracking is 7.99 €, 4.99 for standard mail. Minimum price from DTRPG is 6.25 € for economy. Prices for other EU countries should be similar.<br /><br /><br /><span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink" href="https://plus.google.com/113864117304127544117" oid="113864117304127544117">Johnstone Metzger</a></span> are there significant differences in the amount of money you earn depending on the printer?</p>

        <p>With Lulu, I <i>always</i> use Standard mail (as you said: cheaper than Lightning Source/DTRPG) and I never had problems.<br /><br />Personally, I&#39;m waiting for December because I hope for hefty discounts at Lulu.<br />Last year the best deal I got was 40% off and free shipping.<br />AFAIK the discount only counts for the publisher (lulu) so the author will get the same money.<br /><br />My advice: If you&#39;ve got the chance to pay in USD, change Lulu&#39;s storefront to the US store because they have the best discounts. Shipping costs won&#39;t be higher just because you order from the US storefront.<br /><br />Lightning Source/DTRPG really has problems with bleed in their standard printing options. The paper will flute a bit. Most authors  use standard option nonetheless because otherwise the book will be too expensive.<br /><br />With Class Warefare it shouldn&#39;t be <i>that</i> big of a problem because there are not that many big images in the book but be warned. The pages with full-page images probably won&#39;t look that nice. At least that&#39;s what I <b>assume</b> from my experience with the game <i>Supers! Revised</i>.</p>

        <p>Sophia&#39;s right on all points. The profit difference between countries/regions is literally pennies. Australian sales of CW give me 4 cents more than American sales, and Canadian sales gives me 3 cents less. In contrast, I&#39;ve seen DTRPG printing costs fluctuate more than 50 cents before.</p>

        <p>Actually, I was wondering if there are significant differences in the author&#39;s share  from Lulu to DTRPG. That factors in my choice.</p>

        <p>Lulu takes a smaller percentage of profits but has slightly higher print costs. DTRPG justifies a higher cut by giving authors tons of extra services and advertizing. The real complicating factor is not being able to bundle print+pdf sales at Lulu, which is the expected norm in rpg circles.<br /><br />Basically, though, I try to manage my prices so that the customer doesn&#39;t have to think about what I get out of it. I make the most money if someone buys the print from Lulu AND the pdf from DTRPG, but of course this also costs the most for the customer -- unless they have a good coupon. Coupons do not cost the author anything, the discount comes out of Lulu&#39;s pocket entirely. I make the least amount of money if someone only buys the print from Lulu and no pdf, BUT if someone doesn&#39;t care about the pdf, I want buying from Lulu to be the preferred option, because their print quality is superior. So, that&#39;s the game design that goes into my pricing strategy.</p>

        <p> I am interested in the content and I want to support the creator as much as possible. I think I will buy the PDF on DTRPG and order the book from Lulu, together with a couple of adventures, with the next discounts.<br /><br />You do not sell PDFs with Lulu because of the contract with DTRPG?</p>

        <p>Yeah, the exclusive pdf contract, plus the inability to combine print+pdf into one sale, and the lack of advertizing on Lulu.</p>

        <p>Well, I don&#39;t have a good reason to sell pdfs through any other source. When people want to buy rpg pdfs, DTRPG and RPGNow are the first places they go. It&#39;s not worth it to sell pdfs at Lulu, nobody will buy them there, I dunno about others like Gumroad, and the exclusive contract doesn&#39;t stop you from selling pdfs yourself (directly) or stop you from selling print elsewhere. So yeah, you might as well.</p>

        <p>No no no, you CAN sell them yourself with the exclusive contract in place, you just can&#39;t use any other third party provider. It might depend on how elaborate your setup is, but I think you should be able to sell them from your own website (like with a paypal link to your email or whatever).</p>
