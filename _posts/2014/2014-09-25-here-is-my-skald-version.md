Here is my Skald Version 3. Only a few changes here. Someone mentioned that having debilities that work differently from normal debilities is annoying, so I&#39;ve removed all of those. What this means is I&#39;ve replaced one Raging Song effect (the new power is sort of like the Superstitious rage power from PF), and all the drinks for the Brewer move. I also Changed the dwarf racial because it was sort of related to the things I removed.
