I have a game I&#39;m playing, and one of my players has mentioned an issue that has been nagging at me for a bit. It&#39;s a thing we&#39;ve always worked around in every other game we&#39;ve played, but it&#39;s part of the game in DW. Namely, separate leveling between PCs.<br /><br />In the session I ran yesterday, one of the PCs rolled 4 failures throughout the session, and is well on track to level before everyone else. I&#39;d be curious to hear any reasoning behind that decision, as well as any ideas others may have come up with to circumvent it.<br /><br />Said player and I talked briefly about an Action Point system, which could award an Action Point for a failure, and Action Points could later be used to increase the result of a roll on a 1-for-1 basis. I&#39;m trying to grasp how this could affect the game before really considering it, though. Any thoughts?

        <p>Is there a real actual issue with variable rate leveling for you and your group? I don&#39;t ever see it, so I&#39;m not sure how to suggest solutions.</p>

        <p>In my group, one character levelling too fast or faster than the rest usually means that I&#39;m not giving the other characters sufficient screen time in which to fail (or succeed).  Make sure every character has ample opportunity for failure and they&#39;ll all usually advance concurrently.</p>

        <p>In my group, at one point we had a guy be level 5 and most everyone was level 2. Yeah he failed that many times, but there was no real balance issues. If this were D&amp;D then yeah it can get wonky, but DW you mostly grow horizontally and only get a little vertical progression.</p>

        <p>There&#39;s less of a difference between levels for characters In DW than in DND so it&#39;s really not that big of a problem,<br />Like <span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink" href="https://plus.google.com/112061948037312301151" oid="112061948037312301151">David Benson</a></span> said, make sure you&#39;re giving everyone adequate screen time.<br /><br />Also, if this player failed that often then how close to death were they?</p>

        <p>He was at Death&#39;s Door multiple times. He just gets lucky right at the end.</p>

        <p>I once had a party made of characters of all different levels from 1 to 6. We didn&#39;t notice any problem or issue.</p>

        <p>This sounds like a non-issue to me.</p>
