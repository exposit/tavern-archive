I am highly inspired by <span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink" href="https://plus.google.com/113864117304127544117" oid="113864117304127544117">Johnstone Metzger</a></span>&#39;s <b>Class Warfare</b> so I decided to port some of my old content into that new format. <br />This is my first try. <br /><br /><b>The Herald of the Beast Monarch</b> <br />a riff on the Druid that I hope fits better into the CW mold. It might still be too broad, what do you think Johnstone? <br />I also look forward to any comments/help/critique from you all.

        <p>Of course I immediately started playing with the form and didn&#39;t include racial moves as in the rest of the book...</p>

        <p>I really like this! I&#39;m going to add this to my collection of classes but I&#39;ll probably change one thing. The &quot;mustafa&quot; move. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s in the spirit of DW to award xp for a 10+ roll so I might change that to something like &quot;Hold 1, spend your hold at any point within the next day to gain a +2 to any roll that furthers your Monarchs goals.&quot; Great work overall though!</p>

        <p>Mustafa is basically a combination of this Cleric and Druid move. It fits within DW I think. You actually need to do something specific, not just roll a 10+. <br /><br />Orison for Guidance<br />When you sacrifice something of value to your deity and pray for guidance, your deity tells you what it would have you do. If you do it, mark experience.<br /><br />Communion of Whispers<br />When you spend time in a place, making note of its resident spirits and calling on the spirits of the land, roll+Wis. You will be granted a vision of significance to you, your allies, and the spirits around you. ✴On a 10+ the vision will be clear and helpful to you. ✴On a 7–9 the vision is unclear, its meaning murky. ✴On a miss, the vision is upsetting, frightening, or traumatizing. The GM will describe it. Take -1 forward.</p>

        <p>Ah ok, I believe I misinterpreted the move based on the wording. I read it as &quot;Mark xp, and then take +1 forward if you do as your Monarch wishes.&quot;</p>
