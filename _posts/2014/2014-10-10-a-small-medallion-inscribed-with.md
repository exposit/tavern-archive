A small medallion inscribed with the rune of life. Created by a wizard who wanted to be immortal. When his wife grew old and older the wizard removed it to give it to her. Unfortunately, he did not fully understanding time and how to control it. When he removed the medallion all of his lost years came upon him and he died. Now the medallion has moved through the generations, a small memento of the past.
