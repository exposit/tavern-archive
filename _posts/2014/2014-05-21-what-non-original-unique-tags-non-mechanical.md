What non-original, unique tags [non-mechanical, maybe] have you guys been using in your games and how have they affected the mechanics/fiction? I would like to use them more often but I feel like I work more off the fiction. Say a crossbow can have the &quot;combustable&quot; or &quot;dangerous&quot; tag, for example.<br /><br />Why does it have to have these tags? Wouldn&#39;t there be something inherent in the crossbow that makes the player know this without a tag? How does the tag help you in play?

        <p>To get us all on the same page:<br /><i>Each piece of equipment will have a number of tags. These will tell you something about how the equipment affects the character using it (like +Armor) or suggest something about the way it is used (like the Range tags). Like everything else in Dungeon World, these guide the fiction you’re creating in play. If a weapon is awkward, it might mean that you’re more likely to drop it when you fail that hack and slash roll.</i> </p>

        <p>In general tags are great to get everyone on the same page about <i>stuff</i>. It allows you to say certain things and just point to the tag as justification. It is also a great thing to look at as a GM and choose moves based on that. <br />There is no need to have them but they are a helpful tool. </p>

        <p>And especially tags that are more descriptive (like the one on the animal companion) are a thing i really really like as a GM because i can lean on them hard. If your weapon is <i>loud</i> then it is <b>super loud</b>. Everyone will remember how freaking <b>loud</b> your weapon is. </p>

        <p>Might be some hiding in the drivethrurpg stack of pdfs on magic items that would have interesting tag combinations as well as possible new ones. Have yet to read them but seems it might have some leads for you.</p>

        <p>I use tags for all sorts of things, items, settlements, NPC&#39;s, organizations etc. They serve as great keywords to remind me of how to shape the fiction. As single words tags are also quick and easy to jot down when things come up in play; they are a great way to take notes as you play. </p>
