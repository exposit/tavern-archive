New to the community here.<br /><br />I&#39;m looking to find a few people who enjoy playtesting (on g+ with voice and the roll20 app) new settings based on the DW and Apocalypse World rules. I have a team of 5 people currently creating a setting and we&#39;re looking for fresh eyes.<br /><br />If that&#39;s your thing, let me know!Â

        <p>For those interested in a little more info on the setting, here is the Alpha Playtest package.<br /><br />Edit: Removing old link and adding a new one. Much nicer.<br /><br /><a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/hdofuof6p3julai/Eternity%20Engine%20Playtest%20V1.1.zip" class="ot-anchor">https://www.dropbox.com/s/hdofuof6p3julai/Eternity%20Engine%20Playtest%20V1.1.zip</a></p>
