In the last game, the party druid dealt with a troll by turning into a giant constrictor snake and coiling about it and holding it immobile. I ruled this to be a reasonable creature from her homeland, and the &quot;hold foe&quot; move seemed reasonable. The next round I had the troll trying to bite the snake, but she used another hold to coil around its head and hold it. It didn&#39;t seem reasonable to be able to escape a python through brute strength, so she just held the boss monster for the rest of the right. The other PCs cleaned up the goblins and then slew the helpless troll.<br /><br />Now, that was a cool thing to do in that encounter. She was empowered and awesome. BUT... I don&#39;t want her snake form to turn into an &quot;I win&quot; button every time they meet a troll, or an ogre, or a giant, or a minotaur...<br /><br />I allowed her to establish the hold and then maintain it indefinitely. It is what snakes to after all. It also effectively put her out of the fight, but OTOH she defeated the boss so its worth it.<br /><br />Any thoughts on handling this better? That is the first time she used it, so I don&#39;t know it will be an ongoing problem... but I like to deal with problems before a precedent is set. On the other hand I do want her to be awesome so I don&#39;t want to just nerf it. Just put reasonable limits on it.

        <p>What&#39;s the specific wording of the constrictor&#39;s move?<br /><br />Regardless, a creature of mythic strength (like a troll, ogre, giant, Hulk Hogan, etc.) ought to have a chance to burst free.  &quot;You feel it struggling within, testing even your iron coils! What do you do?&quot;  I clamp down and hold fast!  &quot;Cool, roll +Con to defy danger, the danger being that he bursts forth!&quot;  (On a 7-9, you can keep him held but holy crap it hurts, take damage.)</p>

        <p>I like what <span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink" href="https://plus.google.com/102595580176380683252" oid="102595580176380683252">Jeremy Strandberg</a></span> g said. Plus, the goblins could turn and clobber in the snake as well. Coiled around a creature would make it pretty vulnerable, I would think.</p>

        <p>Thanks, I like the mythic strength idea. Now that you mention it even Conan would sometimes throw off a serpent&#39;s coils. And taking damage is a nice complication.</p>

        <p>Also, if another makes a move and misses, turn your attention to the Druid as a snake. <br />&#39;Ok, so your flurries attack is countered by the goblins and through the Melee you see the ogre slam himself into the wall in a panic as the coils grip tighter. (Druid take the tag &#39;stunned&#39;) Now the dazed Druid is in danger of being crushed against the flagstones! What do you do?!&#39;</p>

        <p>I would also step away from the notion of &quot;boss monster&quot;. It warps your own perception to much. There are no &quot;boss monsters&quot; in the world. </p>

        <p>I&#39;m of the opinion that spending a hold does not negate any danger of performing the action. You can &quot;constrict&quot; someone, but that someone might still cut you, bite you, kick you or even tie a knot on you before you even get the chance to constrict it.<br /><br />If you just go for the troll, that troll will fight you. Spending a hold doesn&#39;t make the troll <i>not</i> fight you, it just mean that once you are in a <i>position</i> to constrict it, you succeed.</p>

        <p>It should also be mentioned that while I agree with mr. <span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink" href="https://plus.google.com/102595580176380683252" oid="102595580176380683252">Jeremy Strandberg</a></span>, I think spending another hold to succeed should be an option as well. You can only constrict it by being a snake after all.</p>
