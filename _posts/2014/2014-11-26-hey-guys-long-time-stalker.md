Hey guys, long time stalker, first time (I think) poster. I think that the stars are <i>finally</i> aligned right so that I get the chance to both play <i>and</i> run Dungeon World! Both of us (two players total, alternating the GM seat) have agreed on lighthearted fantasy, which I guess is kind of a given, and I was kinda wondering if you guys had any good sources of inspiration? Sorry if I&#39;m asking too much...

        <p>How about the movie Willow. It&#39;s a fun light setting that I think really matches the feel of Dungeon world; no +1 swords, just acorns that turn things you throw them at to stone. Plus the movie really revolves around two main characters with a couple of secondary guys.</p>
