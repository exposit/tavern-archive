In our new campaign, we have some new races (or <i>subraces</i>).<br /><br />One player wanted to play a Drow Cleric of the god of Secrets and Power. So, we decided on a Drow racial move for the Cleric:<br /><br /><b>Drow Cleric</b> - The clergy of your race demands obedience in its subject. <i>Cause Fear</i> is a rote for you.<br /><br />We also had a Lizardman Fighter. In this setting, lizardmen are kind of big and burly, with long tails. We made the following racial moves:<br /><br /><b>Lizardman Fighter</b> - Your race is tall and heavy, and you leverage this when you fight. Your melee attacks are <i>forceful</i>.<br /><br /><b>Lizardman Druid</b> - Your race hail from the Stinking Mire. In addition to your other attunements, it is always considered your land.<br /><br /><b>Lizardman Thief</b> - Your long tail is prehensile, and you are as deft with it as you are with your hands.

        <p>We need to make a &quot;tail spike&quot; traditional weapon for Lizardmen...</p>

        <p>Well it is a signature weapon with close range. <br />Then maybe choose +2 piercing and +1 damage? <br /><br />The look is sinister or blood stained. </p>

        <p>alternatively you have your signature weapon and pick the other thing up as an extra weapon. Probarbly just hand, forceful. </p>

        <p>Well, if it was a traditional weapon for lizardmen, it wouldn&#39;t make sense to force it to be a signature weapon</p>

        <p>So does the prehensile tail give a mechanical bonus to picking pockets?</p>

        <p>I imagine No, the tail just gives fictional positioning; like being able to talk to the mark and engage him in conversation at a polite distance with your hands in plain, law-abiding view, <i>while still robbing him blind behind his back.</i></p>
