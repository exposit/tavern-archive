My brother and I are at odds, right now, on the subject of Origin VS Racial moves.<br />On the Origin side, not all elves are the same. A stocky elf or a dainty dwarf might get a few strange looks, but these kinds of characters shouldn&#39;t be impossible. Races should provide only narrative based advantages and disadvantages.<br />On the Racial side, some races are just better at doing certain things than others. Some skills and tendencies are just innate to certain races. Dwarves grow up learning how to forge things, why can&#39;t my class give dwarves bonuses to crafting?<br /><br />I thought of a solution that might work, but I want feedback to see if you guys like it or not:<br />A racial handbook, with a small, versatile move for every race (think Number Appearing, except for the basic races, and each race is counted as &quot;Any Class&quot;). Players would get this move and an Origin move.<br /><br />Thanks in advance for any helpful suggestions!

        <p>Ask yourself: what I want from my game?<br /><br />Racial moves will guide you in a world where races are overimportant, where an individual is first and foremost a member of a race, where the race of a character informs anout their stances and characteristics. It&#39;s classic tolkienian fantasy where all elves are supposed to be gracious and magical, all dwarves stocky and proud, men hot headed and impulsive.<br /><br />Origin moves (as well as legacy moves) will bring forth a game of individuals, where race isn&#39;t very relevant and variety can really bloom. Characters will not be defined by their genetics but by their deeds. They will not be part of a race but individuals and race will not inform you about behaviour and characteristics. Elves are gracious and magical, but YOUR Elf is a lazy burglar from the city that will not recognize a pole from an oak because of <i>reasons</i>.<br /><br />Both narrative are interesting and functional, you just have to choice the one you feel like playing like now (next time you can try the other).</p>
