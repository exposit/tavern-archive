Has anyone written a &quot;sanity check&quot; move?  Something along the lines of:<br />When you are witness to Things Man Was Not Meant To Know, roll +Int / +Wis.  On a 10+, you endure.  On a 7-9, go kinda crazy.  On 6-, go really crazy?

        <p>There is the Lovecraft themed game running off the Apocalypse engine/ruleset called Tremulus, probably in there though not sure where as tablet PDF isn&#39;t in front of me.</p>

        <p>So, I&#39;ve done games with WIS as Sanity points ala hp. You can just have certain things cause Sanity damage, or you can have a move like.<br /><br />When you <b>X the Y</b> roll + WIS. On a 10+ you&#39;re okay but maybe pee a little. On a 7-9 you lose 5 points. On a miss, you lose 10 points and the GM tells you that now you&#39;re afraid of cheese.<br /><br />But not like that. That&#39;s the worst move ever written.</p>

        <p>When you ... roll+?. On a 10+, you shake it off but you&#39;re still troubled (and take -1-forward). On a 7-9, mark 1 madness. On a miss, mark 3 madness.<br /><br />When you do any of the following, spend 1 madness.<br />{insert list of questionable behavior here}<br /><br />When you have N or more madness, the GM can spend X madness (1, 2, or 3?) to have you do... {bad thing or list of bad things}<br /><br />When you have Y or more madness, you go terribly insane and retire your character to madness or sorrow.</p>

        <p>I like the idea of &quot;buying off&quot; the madness you&#39;ve earned.</p>

        <p>There have been a number of prior discussions of sanity moves. Check story games forum and the apocalypse world forums too. You might find something you like. </p>

        <p>Black Stars Rise has some interesting stuff to do with sanity. The game was mentioned, but I thought it might help to give you the link:<br /><br /><a href="http://book.blackstarsrise.com/part/introduction" class="ot-anchor">http://book.blackstarsrise.com/part/introduction</a></p>
