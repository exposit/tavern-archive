Has anyone written up a playbook or move primer? Like, a series of questions to ask yourself when creating new moves for a class? I keep falling back on mechanical stuff and feel like a need an external prompt to keep myself nimble and out of that rut. Searches have proven fruitless thus far, any help appreciated!
