I GM&#39;d my second session of Dungeon World today...<br />And <i>I got it</i>.<br /><br />It&#39;s so natural, so fluid, I might have overly stressed description a bit (literally a single combat encounter was the adventure) But other than that it was amazing! <br /><br />At first the PC&#39;s were tentative, not really sure how to roleplay, but after a few nudges and pushes, they started. And it rolled on from there. A Barbarian, Paladin, Cleric, Bard and Fighter. I do not recommend playing with so many characters because (at least in my case) I let 3 or so characters have the spotlight for long periods of time. <br /><br />I want to thank those that wrote the Dungeon World Guide. Because that was what really allowed me to understand what was going on. <br />And GM moves? Effortless. Well, at the beginning. But after 4 hours of creative haul your brain begins to fry a bit. <br />Dungeon World is everything I ever wanted in a Tabletop RPG. Simple, fast, easy to use, and there is no stat clogging (which was what I dislike about d20. You find out midway through the session that there was some stat you forgot to use. Almost inevitable)<br /><br />Thanks to the Tavern. You guys were a great help.<br /><br />But most of all, thanks to the creators of Dungeon World.<br /><br />P.S. How do you, speed up an adventure? I used lots of narrative but it all seemed to drag on a bit.

        <p>Glad you are having a great time Jasper!<br /><br />The key to quicker parts of the adventure is to zoom out and clearly communicate what a roll means. Instead of &quot;The orc swings at you, what do you do?&quot; You set it up like &quot;Between you and the room with the Crystal of So and So stands a gang of about 20 orcs. What do you do to handle this problem?&quot;<br /><br />Then let a single roll determine the entire outcome.<br /><br />Fighter says he&#39;s killing every last one of them. <br />Rolls a 10- They all die<br />Rolls a 7-9- Most of them die, but some go get &quot;The big momma&quot;<br />Rolls a 6- He gets captured!<br /><br />In situations like this I like to see what other characters are helping with the effort and how, they roll an applicable stat, and suffer/benefit from the outcome.<br /><br />In this way I ran a game with 10 players last night with three separate groups, and while it was not ideal to have that many players, it seemed like everybody had a good time.<br /><br />Also we played for about 3.5 hours. In that time one group successfully set themselves up as the undisputed rulers of a territory, another group slaughtered a goblin infestation and looted every last chicken bone and ogre finger, and the last group travelled to a cursed tower and confronted stone golems guardians. <br /><br />I&#39;ve actually found five to be about the ideal amount of players using a mixture of zooming in and zooming out.<br /><br />Good luck!</p>

        <p>In re: speed.<br /><br />One common pacing problem is sessions running like an episode of &quot;24&quot;: in real-time. If we are playing out a scene, there ought to be a reason we&#39;re seeing this part of the story.<br /><br />Tedious things, like political negotiations or hauling a subdued enemy back to the player&#39;s homebase (or the other way around) can be compressed where only the fun stuff happens &quot;on stage.&quot;<br /><br />If players stop triggering moves and just plod through a paint by numbers scenario, jump to something interesting.</p>

        <p>Congrats on a fun session.  I prefer a group of about 5, DW certainly makes it much easier to manage such a size even in combat.</p>

        <p>One of the best GM moves you can make when there is a lull in the conversation is to <b>put them in a spot</b>. Aggressively shift the fiction and frame a new scene that <i>fills their lives full of adventure</i>.<br /><br />This technique, in addition to zooming in and out, are your pacing standbys. Don&#39;t let scenes drag. Cut like a director or editor and move on to the good stuff. What the &#39;good stuff&#39; is is all dependant on what you and your group like to roleplay out in more detail. If folks are having fun, why rush?</p>
