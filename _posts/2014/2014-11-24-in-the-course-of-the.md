In the course of the game I&#39;ve been running, our Barbarian has described a pretty awesome place of origin. I&#39;m thinking of making it a potential destination, and to differentiate it from the rest of the world, give it a full Swords &amp; Wizardry makeover. Specifically, I&#39;d like to put a twist on the magic of the Bard and the Cleric. In the land of barbarians, magic doesn&#39;t simply &quot;work&quot;. Sorcerers are evil, and bring plague and suffering! They sacrifice princesses to dark gods to power their evil magics! I&#39;m thinking something like a move, triggered on them casting/playing.<br /><br />For the Cleric, it could be a chance that the spell fails because their god isn&#39;t present here, or perhaps an outsider listening in and allowing the spell to be cast, but with a twist (Demon? Lovecraftian horror? Who knows?!).<br /><br />For the Bard, perhaps a &quot;deal with the devil&quot; could be in order, where some local outsider (see above) is willing to give them back the power to cast, but with a price.<br /><br />Is this the right way to go? I&#39;m a big fan of the S&amp;W genre (Conan, Thongor, etc), and I&#39;d like to get some of that into DW rather than switching over to Barbarians of Lemuria or something while we&#39;re in the Barbarian&#39;s homeland. Do you guys and gals have any ideas? Have you done something like this before? Maybe a compendium class or three is the way to go? Should I just do this in fiction, moves be damned?<br /><br />(For reference, the party is a Barbarian, Bard, Cleric, and Thief, and I&#39;m not worried about the Barbarian and the Thief fitting in)

        <p>For the Cleric you can just step in at the first failure with a move. <br />Don&#39;t take away their magic, that would be uncool, at least not right away but hint at a distance from their god, at the <i>possibility</i> to loose the connection with the divinity, because it is not strong there. Then present them temptation in the form of a dark pact: follow the precepts of this lovecraftian horror and you will keep your magic even if your god will be silent. <br />See what happens, what the Cleric values most: Faith or the power Faith gives. What would happen one they go back? <br /><br />For the bard removing the magic they worked for right away could be a serious bump. <br />Maybe you can just change the rules. <br />What about changing the 7/9 results in &quot;choose one: you forgot the spell; the spell doesn&#39;t work; you have to do a sacrifice for it to work&quot;. <br /><br />Either way, remember: taking away what makes a character &quot;cool&quot; is the best way to have boring characters. Put a price on the coolness, make them work for it, challenge them with it but don&#39;t simply take it away. <br />You should not loose your coolness, but if you <i>renounce</i> it, it should be a very dramatic and important moment.</p>

        <p>A slightly more mechanical approach: you could create a countdown to how much you think it&#39;s appropriate for each spellcaster, describe the players how strange/evil/alien it feels to them casting spells, and add to the hard moves (6- or when appropriate) the option of marking off one from countdown.<br />When the countdown is finished, let the players face the consequences of their choices. <br />If you do manage things this way,it&#39;s important that you make the growing evil/corruption clear and the countdown long enough that the player can meaningfully choose if the use of magic is worth the risk.</p>

        <p>That&#39;s not a move. That&#39;s a whole Front with Grim Portents and an Impending Doom. <br /><br />It would work like charm, but it will focus the game on that.</p>

        <p>It&#39;s a move taken almost verbatim from the new moves in the Plarch Codex (p.10 italian ed., don&#39;t have the original version readily available) where it&#39;s proposed as a simple way to manage a single source of growing danger that&#39;s going to manifest later. There are no prepared grim portents, just the players&#39; awareness that some danger is getting closer when they do something connected to it. A Front lite, if you will.</p>
