        <p>I know that someone was creating a wiki for DW, but then it went offline. Not sure if that&#39;s coming back.</p>

        <p>I believe <span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink" href="https://plus.google.com/116124411286229550721" oid="116124411286229550721">David Schirduan</a></span> was working on a wiki not too long ago. Not sure what the status of that project is currently.</p>

        <p>Well, I was working with <span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink" href="https://plus.google.com/117415966179711277938" oid="117415966179711277938">Sage LaTorra</a></span> on the wiki, but he had to drop it to focus on the upcoming war supplement. If someone else is willing to host the server, I still have some of the HTML, and Sage should have all the data backed up. It shouldn&#39;t take more than a few days to get it back up<br /><br />The main problem was the overwhelming amount of spam we were hit with. When it goes back up, it will be more deliberate and secure.<br />EDIT: was working with Sage, not Adam. Sorry!</p>

        <p>It might be worth creating a unique post to ask for community help. Seems like the sort of things folks would get behind. This community needs a central spot for amassing information and created play aides. Epically so ^_^;</p>

        <p>I totally agree. Sage has a TON on his plate, maybe we can relieve some pressure. If someone can pay for the domain and server, I can host and admin.</p>

        <p>Would a free wiki hosting service like Wikia.com work? Or do you already have a database coded for a particular piece of software?</p>

        <p>well, I wrote a script to import all of the monsters from the Dungeon World codex, which contains about 1200+ monsters, and allow for better sorting and viewing (sort by size, damage, environment, etc)<br />And I wouldn&#39;t be able to use scripts like that on Wikia.com</p>

        <p>Point well made. We definitely need a custom solution!</p>

        <p>Which wiki engine were you using?</p>
