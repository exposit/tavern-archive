<b>Wound Moves</b><br /><br />Spurred by another conversation about removing HP (and stats in general) from *world games, I started thinking about how wounds could be portrayed as temporary, detrimental moves.<br /><br />For example;<br /><br /><b>Broken Arm</b><br />Your arm is broken. When <i>you do or experience something that would cause you pain because of your broken arm</i> roll+CON. Take +2 if your arm is somehow stabilized. On a +10 you grit your teeth and pull through. On a 7-9 you still pull through, but your arm is bashed or shaken in the progress. Take 1d4 damage that <i>ignores armor</i>.<br /><br />I realize this will lead to an unnecessary granularity, and it would probably bog down the flow  of the game and make it unplayable. I thought the thought exercise was nice though, as making the moves forces you to consider how detrimental these kinds of injuries are to a character, helping you to improvise on the fly.<br /><br />Note the &quot;take +2&quot; bonus; I thought it was nice to include an explicit way to overcome the most gruesome effects.<br /><br />Thoughts?

        <p>Not a fan. Especially the damage on a 7-9 seems off to me for some reason. <br /><br />It&#39;s more an instinctual thing right now, can&#39;t explain it fully.</p>

        <p>We added a second level of Debility to our game, so you could end up with a -2 penalty to a stat. Worked well but I would caution that in DW rolling a stat with a -2 is just begging for trouble.<br /><br />Also I ran a one-shot, gritty near-future hack that handled all damage as ever increasing debilities. Players were told that in addition to the normal results (10+, 7-9, 6-) a roll of 0 or less could result in death/coma/incarceration or some other character ending circumstance. Worked out good for a one-shot.</p>

        <p>My problem with your move is that you&#39;d need one for every  type of conceivable injury. I&#39;d go for one or two moves, with a list of choices (10+, you choose one ; 7-9, the GM choses one ; 6-, you&#39;re screwed).</p>

        <p>on damage<br /><br />It threatens bruises and scrapes at worst: d4 damage<br />It’s likely to spill some blood, but nothing horrendous: d6 damage<br />It might break some bones: d8 damage<br />It could kill a common person: d10 damage</p>

A common person has 3 HP, so a spear strike does enough damage to kill them more often than not.

        <p>Tim&#39;s list if official - it&#39;s somewhere in the book.<br />What I think Kasper means is that, playing with ho HP, you&#39;d have to acknowledge that a spear is capable of killing anybody. Which would make a puny gobelin much more dangerous to a player character. </p>

        <p>Well no. How deadly a goblin spear is depends on the fiction. When you play &quot;exalted&quot; then you don&#39;t care. If you play &quot;Song of Ice and Fire&quot; then it ruins your day. </p>

        <p>My problem lately is a lack of certainty on when I should do cool awesome fiction things (remove limbs) <i>in addition</i> to damage or just do one or the other. When is it fair? When is it not. To be specific, if a Sahaguin uses <i>Bite Off a Limb</i> when a PC&#39;s roll lets it make an attack, is it fair to also do damage? Or better, under what circumstances is it fair to also do damage.<br /><br />My PCs are passing level 10 now and they tend to succeed a lot. Our fictional world is definitely leaning more toward superheroness than toward gritty. I think I want to push back toward gritty, but I don&#39;t want to jar their sensibilities.</p>

It&#39;s an abstraction, obviously.<br />Have you ever played Rolemaster? Every wound detailed, say, arrows cutting your carotid artery, broken bones, etc, tables categorised by weapon types, and (if I remember correctly) cross referenced against target armour. Right up your alley. Pages of tables, though, and tricky to convert that to *world. Likewise, hordes of damage results.</p>

        <p>I&#39;m not sure you understood my OP. I explicitly stated this might useful be as an <i>exercise</i>, not something that was to be <i>used</i>.<br /><br />I have no interest in making use of a long list of such moves, and consequently Rolemaster doesn&#39;t interest me in the slightest. I&#39;m not sure how you got that idea.<br /><br />All <i>your</i> posts however indicates to me that you consider HP as a scale of measurement.<br /><br />&quot;A common person has 3 hp.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;An elvish warrior only has 3 hp, too.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;My only disagreement with you is that I don&#39;t think the damage is underpowered, it&#39;s the Heroes have stupidly high hitpoints.&quot;<br /><br />Especially the last comment doesn&#39;t make sense in my head if you didn&#39;t consider it a scale of measurement, because you actually <i>compare two values</i> and conclude that <i>heroes have stupid high hit points</i>.<br /><br />Note that I never used the wording &quot; <i>exact</i> measure&quot;. It can still be a scale of measure without being <i>exact</i>. In that case it&#39;s an <i>estimate</i>.<br /><br />I don&#39;t even consider HP a fictional measure at all. In my head it&#39;s <i>entirely</i> a mechanical measure meant to tell the people around the table how close a character is to rolling for Last Breath.<br /><br />The <i>event</i> that reduces the character to 0 HP is originates in the fiction, meaning that 6 damage might not mean the same in the fiction when reducing you from 24 hp to 18, as when it reduces you from 3 to 0.<br /><br />In this case, being reduced to 18 hp from 24 could mean that you received a whack to your helmet. Being reduced to 0 could mean that your skull cracked and brain fluids started leaking.<br /><br />As such, the scale measure doesn&#39;t exist in the fiction, but we decide, case by case, what happened to the character more based on how the damage was dealt than how much damage he took, and of course whether this reduced the character to 0 hp or not.<br /><br />I understand that the above paragraph is entirely subjective, but there is no rule declaring what 3 hp <i>means</i>, but by your logic, combined with the chart <span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink" href="https://plus.google.com/110330901807759406775" oid="110330901807759406775">Tim Franzke</a></span> referred to, &quot;bruises and scrapes&quot; kills a commoner about half the time.<br /><br />I&#39;m pretty sure you don&#39;t believe that, and I&#39;m pretty sure it isn&#39;t <i>intended</i> to mean that. I just believe that HP is so heavily abstracted that it doesn&#39;t mean anything in itself, but we just choose to impart circumstantial meaning to it.</p>

        <p>You&#39;re right, I suppose. There&#39;s a scale of weapon vs squishy commoner that feels about right to me, and Tims table of effect vs hero I&#39;m more dubious about. The 3 HP hero might allow for more consistency...<br />Back to the O.P.; Tags, not moves. The character is tagged &quot;Arm broken&quot;, and let fiction do the rest. Short fiction, if tagged &quot;Carotid Slashed&quot;</p>
