I have really enjoyed my time in this community and my experience with DW. Some major changes in my life are prompting me to free up more time which means my hobbies need to go by the wayside for a bit. I just wanted to let you guys know that I won&#39;t be around so much anymore.<br /><br />Should anybody need to contact me you can do so through G+ or email TablaSaura over at the gmail. I&#39;ve had a fantastic time conversing with all of you and wish you all gaming bliss in the future. Take Care!

        <p>I&#39;m afraid we cannot allow you to leave, Marques.  You understand, of course.  The needs of the geek outweigh the needs of the family.</p>

        <p>Thank you all very much. You are very kind. My wife just found out she is pregnant with our fifth child. We weren&#39;t planning on it and it came as a bit of a surprise. As a result I need to really focus on my job as my current income isn&#39;t where we need it to be for another child.<br /><br />Also, my wife recently had a promotion at work and her free time has been drastically cut. All in all, times are changing and I&#39;m scrambling to keep up. I am going to miss you fine folks and our talks more than you know ^_^</p>
