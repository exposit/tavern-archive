        <p>That was my initial intention until I reread the move. :P<br />Specifically...<br />* The Dead and Undead<br />* Spells and Magicks<br />* The Planar Spheres<br />* Gods and Their Servants</p>
</div>

        <p>I&#39;m at...<br />*Æther Subjects<br />* Alien Cultures<br />* Cosmic Bestiary<br />* Galactic Politics<br />* History of the Universe<br /><br />(Æther is space magic)<br /><br />I was hoping for a few more.</p>

        <p>What I&#39;d probably do is restrict knowldge skills to the Race/Empire/planet (depending on how you do skills)<br />so turian culture or new republic politics<br />Let the bardic lore ignore those restrictions</p>

        <p>So Æther covers &#39;force&#39; like subjects? History of the Jedi - like organisations? <br />What about FTL travel or the warp?<br />Technology of the ancients?<br />Worlds and Systems?</p>

        <p>How about:<br />- Alien Biology &amp; Common Evolutionary Threads<br />(You can&#39;t known every alien in the galaxy, but you can look at something and based on general ecological niches etc, you can tell if it&#39;s a predator, how it attacks and all that)<br /><br />- Ætheric Power &amp; The Great Works<br />(You know about space magic, but you also know about the different users of it and the things they make with it)<br /><br />- Galactic Politics &amp; Military Application<br />(Knowing about who rules who is important, but even the most democratic nation needs an army, knowing about the two go hand in hand, especially for a space adventurer)<br /><br />- Galactic Culture &amp; Fitting in Quick<br />(You know about the things people worship, the old languages they speak in private and how you should take your shoes off at the door of a Yanguam&#39;s house before you step in, you know what to do and what not to do)<br /><br />- Redacted Historical Records &amp; ShadowNet Information<br />(You know about the history of the universe, and thats cool, but you also know about things governments keep hidden and long lost knowledge)<br /><br />- Space Truckers &amp; Imperium Bastards<br />(You know all about the legendary star-fighters of the distant past, the outer rim rebels who will lend anyone with a blaster pistol a hand if they&#39;ll help them in turn and people you really shouldn&#39;t piss off)<br /><br />- General Navigation &amp; Pirate Asteroid Field Routes<br />(You know about the lay of the land, as it were, who goes where and why, and you&#39;ve at least heard of several shortcuts between the Red Moons and Casanuna 5)<br /><br />- Xenological Beings &amp; Spacial Disruption<br />(Some things don&#39;t make sense, sometimes a fungus can raise the dead, sometimes a life form is made of pure energy, sometimes time gets distorted, thats xenologic, man)</p>

        <p>Also, change the name of the bard playbook and &#39;bardic lore&#39; to Hitchhiker, and Hitchhiker lore. :D</p>

I was going with the more boring Leader with the starting moves Specialty (bardic lore), Charming and Open, A Port in the Storm and Inspiration (arcane art). But now I&#39;m second guessing myself. :)</p>

        <p>I know it&#39;s not mass effect or star wars inspired, but thematically, it&#39;s perfect!<br />Being a student of the universe who always &#39;knows a guy who knows a guy&#39; seems more core to that playbook&#39;s identity than what their &#39;job&#39; is.<br /><br /><b>The Hitchhiker</b><br />It doesn&#39;t matter if you&#39;re the captain, or just a smooth dude with a towel and a guidebook, a Hitchhiker is a graduate of the school of hard knocks. Screw books, your knowledge is hard-won through experience. Whether it&#39;s a blaster rifle or co-ordinates to a planet made of gold, the Hitchhiker knows exactly what you need, and how to get it.<br /><br /><br />well dang, now I want to make a sci-fi hack haha :)</p>

        <p>Like, another way to look at it would be:<br />If I were running a Firefly inspired game. Captain Reynolds would totally be a Hitchhiker who&#39;s also good in a fight.<br /><br />A Mass Effect game, Liara would also be a Hitchhiker, but she&#39;s not very combat focused.<br /><br />A Star Wars game, Han Solo would be obvious, but even less obvious a Hitchhiker would be Yoda.</p>

        <p>I intend on checking out Hercules someday, silly/fun action romps are usually a good time. :)<br /><br />But yeah, I love the Hitchhiker idea. Tying anything in with the Hitchhiker&#39;s Guide to the Galaxy is always a plus!<br />My only worry is in regards to arcane art. How would you reflavor that? (I&#39;m directly opposed to changing it out for another move) Maybe call it, &#39;Inspirational Quip&#39; or &#39;Well-Timed One-Liner&#39;?</p>
