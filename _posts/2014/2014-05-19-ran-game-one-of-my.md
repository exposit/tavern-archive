Ran game one of my first DW campaign this past Friday. Here&#39;s a link to the adventure log for anyone interested: <a href="https://fridayknights.obsidianportal.com/adventure-log/chapter-one" class="ot-anchor">https://fridayknights.obsidianportal.com/adventure-log/chapter-one</a><br /><br />All in all, it was a fun game, and the adventure log does little to capture the general hilarity that permeated the table. Of particular note is the paladin&#39;s god, the Thresher, who cuts men in twain like stalks of wheat should they be judge unworthy. There was much threshing at the table that night.
