This is my formal apology for my previous post.<br /><br />Seeing as I am of the very small minority in this situation, I can understand the offense people took at my accusation. Though I will never charge for the playbooks I make, I will never berate others for making money off of their own.

        <p>Personally, I don&#39;t think you need to apologise - you took a position, most responders disagreed with it. (tho the &quot;you shouldn&#39;t want money, just recognition&quot; angle was pretty much guaranteed to set people off - challenging people&#39;s <i>goals</i> always raises hackles)</p>

        <p>Monetizing hobbies comes with certain difficulties. It is something I typically avoid, simply because my mental state when I do something for money is different than when I do something for love. But, this varies hugely.</p>
