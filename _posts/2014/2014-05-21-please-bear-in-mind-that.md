Please bear in mind that this is being written by someone who hasn&#39;t played and was asking for clarification to understand the rules, like, yesterday (and probably won&#39;t get to play soon, baby due any week).<br /><br />I was thinking about how Dungeon World and the Dungeon Crawl Classics RPG&#39;s wizard patrons could be used in tandem, and this is what I&#39;ve got so far:<br /><br />Patron-Bound<br />When you engage in the required rituals to commune with a supernatural patron (demon, demigod, or alien entity) and pledge your service in exchange for power, you may take this move the next time you level up:<br /><br />Invoke Patron - When you call upon your patron to bolster your power, roll +Wis. *On 10+, choose two. *On 7-9, choose one. *On 6-, your calls fall on deaf ears.<br /><br />*You gain +2 forward to cast a spell<br />*Your patron doesn&#39;t give you a task to complete<br />*You don&#39;t gain patron taint (mutation)<br /><br />As long as you have a task for your patron incomplete, you cannot call on them for further power.<br /><br />If you have invoked the name of your patron in exchange for power, the next time you level up you can take a Patron spell in place of a regular spell. All patrons have a 1st, 3rd, and 5th level spell.

        <p>My primary question is, are there any possible benefits to &quot;Invoke Patron&quot; other than the option to gain +2 forward to cast a spell? Otherwise, I see a problem with the choice given to the player on a 10+. Essentially, they can either avoid all negative effects (chose options 2 + 3), or they can get a positive effect and a negative effect. As a player, I&#39;m not really sure why I would use this ability, because in just about every case, it will probably hurt me.<br /><br />Maybe have only one negative choice and 2 positive? That way, if you get a 7-9, your choice is between getting what you want and having a bad thing happen, or keeping bad things from happening and not getting what you want.</p>

I&#39;ve been leaning toward upping the positive effect all the way to plus three, since the fiction should reflect patrons as demanding beings, since it&#39;s more of a business relationship than a faith/loyalty thing, but I was also thinking about this - let me know your thoughts (this assumes bonuses forward stack):<br />10+ Choose 3, 7-9, Choose 2:<br />*Take +2 forward to cast a spell<br />*Take +1 forward to cast a spell<br />*Patron doesn&#39;t give you a task<br />*You don&#39;t take patron taint﻿<br /><br />EDIT: Also, this is my hack at writing a generic version, I&#39;m sure a lot of DCC patrons have some cool effects on their Invoke Patron results that could be incorporated into a DW move version. But bonuses to things are def most common invoke patron result, and subsequent access to patron spells are added benefit.</p>

        <p>Actually, I might re-word it to something like:<br /><br />10+ : Take +2 (could adjust up to +3, season to taste) forward to cast a spell<br />7-9: Take +2 (or 3) forward to cast a spell, but your Patron is displeased (so, the GM adds in a complication here)<br /><br />I think it fits a bit better thematically to let the GM come up with the &quot;bad thing&quot; instead of the player essentially choosing which bad thing they get, since in DCC, it&#39;s determined by the dice.<br /><br />Though, your version isn&#39;t bad. There at least is a way for a 10+ to possibly hurt you a bit if you want to go all-out, which isn&#39;t bad, but a +1 vs a task/taint? Not sure if I would take the +1 option, making it possibly a non-choice.</p>

The more I think about it, I was starting to lean toward 10+ get both, 7-9, pick one:<br />*Get +2 forward to spells<br />*Don&#39;t get patron taint<br /><br />And just leave the patron gives you a task portion to GM story development … maybe the Patron becomes a front?</p>

It is tempting to pull in a DCC taint table for inspiration, though</p>
