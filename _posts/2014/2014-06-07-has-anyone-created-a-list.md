Has anyone created a list of &quot;standard&quot; D&amp;D type magic items translated into more interesting DW magic items?  I&#39;d love to see a few examples of the translation process.  For example, how to make a ring of feather fall more interesting?  Should it just work or should there be a roll with consequences?  Should all, or most, DW magic items that &quot;just work&quot; in D&amp;D require a roll?

        <p>I guess it depends on a lot of things. For instance, if your game is set in a <i>very</i> magical world, magical items are relatively &quot;easy&quot; to find and you think each PC will sooner or later have 2-3 magical items, making custom moves that involve dice rolling* for them all could become tiring and not so interesting. On the other hand, if a Ring of Feather Fall is an extraordinary and unique item, you should make up a history about it (or, better, ask someone questions and build on the answers) and think about some move that makes interesting and maybe not entirely safe using it. Maybe it makes you temporarily super-light but it also makes you hollow, more fragile or something like that. Then again, to make such an object central and interesting, there should be an uncanny rate of falling in your campaign... I don&#39;t know if I make sense or if I&#39;m just rambling, but the point is: it really depends a lot from the type of campaign that you and your friends at the table want to run. My advice is: don&#39;t waste time making up moves and objects that are &quot;just magical items&quot; among other stuff; that&#39;s not really interesting imho...<br /><br />* <i>&quot;When you wear the Feather Fall Ring, you can float whenever you want during a fall&quot;</i> <b>is</b> a move, by the way, just not a &quot;Roll +stat&quot; one.</p>

        <p>In my Pathfinder-to-DW campaign, I translated each magic item the PCs found. Something like a ring that was &quot;always on&quot; would usually always work, i.e.:<br /><br /><b>RING OF FEATHER FALL</b><br />When you <i>wear the Ring of Feather Fall and fall from a height</i>, you weigh as much as a feather.<br /><br />Sometimes I would write custom moves with variable outcomes for specific, cool magic items. And for for items that might not always work, I wrote some basic moves for general categories:<br /><br /><b>READ SCROLL</b><br />You can only cast the spell contained in a scroll if you can read magic. When you <i>speak the words inscribed upon a scroll</i>, the scroll crumbles to dus and roll +INT:<br /><br />	10+	The spell is cast as described.<br />	7-9	The spell is cast, but you must choose 1 from the list below.<br />	6-	Mark XP. The spell fizzles, and the GM makes a move.<br /><br />	*  You suffer 1d4 damage from a surge of uncontrolled magical energy.<br />	*  The spell strikes a target other than the intended target (GM decides).<br />	*  The spell’s effect on the target is contrary to the spell’s normal effect (GM decides in what way).<br />	*  You suffer a strange and unexpected side effect of limited duration (GM decides).<br /><br /><b>WAVE WAND</b><br />You can only cast the spell contained in a wand if you have the “Cast Spell” or “Use Magical Device” move. When you <i>attempt to cast a spell contained by a magic wand</i>, mark off 1 charge and roll +INT:<br /><br />	10+	The spell is cast as described.<br />	7-9	The spell is cast, but not quite as expected. Choose 1 from the list below.<br />	6-	Mark XP. The spell backfires, hits the wrong target, or fizzles (GM decides).<br /><br />	*  The casting draws undue attention to you or puts you in a spot (GM decides).<br />	*  The spell consumes an additional charge.<br />	*  The spell strikes a target other than the intended target (GM decides).<br />	*  The spell takes effect at half strength.<br /><br /><b>WIELD STAFF</b><br />You can only cast the spells contained in a staff if you have the “Cast Spell” or “Use Magical Device” move. When you <i>attempt to cast a spell contained by a magic staff</i>, mark off 1 charge and roll +INT:<br /><br />	10+	The spell is cast as described.<br />	7-9	The spell is cast, but not quite as expected. Choose 1 from the list below.<br />	6-	Mark XP. The spell backfires, hits the wrong target, or fizzles (GM decides).<br /><br />	*  The casting draws undue attention to you or puts you in a spot (GM decides).<br />	*  The spell consumes an additional charge.<br />	*  The spell strikes a target other than the intended target (GM decides).<br /><br />When you prepare spells, you may also recharge your staff.<br /><br /><b>RAISE ROD</b><br />Anyone can use a rod. When you <i>attempt to use the power invested in a magical rod</i>, roll +INT:<br /><br />	10+	The rod functions as described.<br />	7-9	The rod functions as described, but may not be used again until the next sunrise.<br />	6-	Mark XP. The attempt fails, rod may not be used again until the next sunrise, and GM makes a move.</p>

        <p>If I wanted to make it <i>just</i> like <i>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</i>, I would have a ring of feather falling just make it so that you <i>always</i> fall slowly, and never take damage from falling. <br /><br />If I wanted to make it more interesting, or at least double-edged, I would make it a ring of feather <i>weight</i>: you always fall slowly and have 0 weight, but can be knocked around by every attack and blown about by wind.<br /><br />For wands, I made a blasting rod for my magic item book (here: <a href="http://bit.ly/1q9hPZk" class="ot-anchor">http://bit.ly/1q9hPZk</a>) that holds charges and lets you volley using INT. <br /><br />You could do something similar with actual spells: when you Cast a Spell, on a 7-9 the wand can lose a charge, or maybe the wand loses a charge each time, and a wizard has to &quot;lose&quot; spells to recharge it.</p>
