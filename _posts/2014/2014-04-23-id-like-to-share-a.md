I&#39;d like to share a move I made for my campaign, I call it:<br />Tell us a tale: At the start of the session, if you are the first to recount the party&#39;s adventures from last time, mark xp.<br /><br />We play once a week and it&#39;s really hard sometimes for players to remember what happened last time (we&#39;re all busy adults and such) this encourages them to write it down so they can claim the xp next week. As to having to be the first to tell us a tale, that&#39;s for a perfect world, I&#39;m usually pretty lenient as it often takes 2 or more to tell the whole tale so I usually let both mark xp. Anyone else try a move like this in their games?

        <p>I love it (and it reminds me of another system) but I would prefer to give +1 forward, as my players are already swimming in XP.</p>

        <p>Mouse Guard/Torchbearer has this backed into the rules. I would put in a clause about the same person not being able to do that thing twince in a row. </p>

        <p>Maybe 1 preparation would be better? +1 forward to anything/stuff always feels a bit weird to me. </p>

        <p>Yeah I agree with <span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink" href="https://plus.google.com/110330901807759406775" oid="110330901807759406775">Tim Franzke</a></span>, <b>Mouse Guard</b> does that beautifully. I love how the narrator role revolves, so everyone gets a shot at it. I also think that I&#39;d personally would go the route that <span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink" href="https://plus.google.com/105472060898626050077" oid="105472060898626050077">Matt Horam</a></span> suggests instead, and grant +1 forward. XP is much easier to come by in <b>Dungeon World</b>, and you want to encourage your player characters to go for it fully, put themselves in a bind, and dare to fail, on top of the desire to wrap up Bonds, perform their Alignment Moves, and go for the holy trinity of Knowledge, Monsters, and Treasure.</p>

        <p>A great incentive, whether it&#39;s xp or +1 forward. I&#39;d go with the trigger <br /><br />At the beginning of your session, When you tell the tale of at least one important fact or event from your recent adventures, choose one:<br /><br />Gain 1 xp<br />Take +1 forward.</p>

        <p>Yeah, it also needs some sort of validation step to qualify for, and the also something that cancels it. I much prefer the simplicity of what <span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink" href="https://plus.google.com/113847025671240258531" oid="113847025671240258531">Adrian Thoen</a></span> typed up.</p>

        <p>Really? I doubt that would be the case if I offered this move to <span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink" href="https://plus.google.com/111363131031408335773" oid="111363131031408335773">Daniel Ryrfeldt</a></span>. He&#39;s the lone player in my game, and racked up 15 XP last session, with 13 of those due to failed rolls. He also lost all his equipment,  barring his beaten up armor, so a +1 would be much appreciated at this time.</p>

        <p>Torchbearer, yes that&#39;s where I got the inspiration for this and then completely forgot. My players aren&#39;t swimming in XP, we&#39;ve been playing since November roughly once a week and the highest level characters are at 8th (so they don&#39;t fail quite as often as they used to, except the cleric with terrible dice luck who died last week). I wanted to make it so that a person couldn&#39;t claim it every week, but one player never claims it, and one player always writes down what happened (but doesn&#39;t always claim it, sometimes he starts and lets someone else finish and tells me he doesn&#39;t want the xp and to give it to the other player who spoke up to finish the tale).</p>
