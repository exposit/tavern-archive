So after seeing the amazing efforts of the likes of <span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink" href="https://plus.google.com/116481777618588720839" oid="116481777618588720839">Epidiah Ravachol</a></span>, <span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink" href="https://plus.google.com/105182874766253582958" oid="105182874766253582958">Dyson Logos</a></span> and <span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink" href="https://plus.google.com/113864117304127544117" oid="113864117304127544117">Johnstone Metzger</a></span> I&#39;m starting my own Patreon campaign. I&#39;ll be posting new adventures and other regular Dungeon World content to my website (<a href="http://www.joebanner.co.uk" class="ot-anchor">www.joebanner.co.uk</a>).<br /><br />If you like what you see and want to keep me in coffee and internets to enable me to do more, you can pledge a little something (and there are some extra rewards if you pledge a little more.) If you just want to come to the blog and snag some Dungeon World PDFs made by me, for you, that&#39;s cool too.

        <p>totally supporting this! <br /><br />I&#39;m running a huge, expansive open world episodic multi-party game this year. It will mostly be a bunch of one-shots tied together with a central hub location. <br /><br />To keep intellectual costs and effort down, I plan on stealing as much as possible from other people! Thanks Joe!</p>
