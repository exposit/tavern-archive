I&#39;ve just bought Class Warfare but... I haven&#39;t been able to find a specialty that replicate the druid shapeshifting. Is there any in the manual?

        <p>2 things<br /><br />#1: To quote <span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink" href="https://plus.google.com/113864117304127544117" oid="113864117304127544117">Johnstone Metzger</a></span> from the book, page 13:<br /><i>Not every class is built around three distinct powers, however. The Druid, for instance, is almost completely devoted to shapechanging, with her other moves backing up that concept, but not adding much in the way of dynamic special abilities. But this book isn’t designed to make new classes like the Druid—the material presented here is all about balancing a few different archetypal concepts or tropes, the way the other original character classes do.</i> <br /><br />#2: Here is a Shapechanger Specialty i wrote you might want to use:<br /><a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1RvvcdQXRpdqCU89dq1bBBwll5dwtQEwUuEDgFlnNOJA&amp;authuser=0" class="ot-anchor">https://drive.google.com/open?id=1RvvcdQXRpdqCU89dq1bBBwll5dwtQEwUuEDgFlnNOJA&amp;authuser=0</a></p>

        <p>Thank you very much! :D<br />Are there other classes NOT replicated by specialties?</p>
