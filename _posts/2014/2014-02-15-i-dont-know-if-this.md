I don&#39;t know if this would be fun to play, or if it&#39;s seriously broken, mechanically. But I had the idea, and wanted to see if I could make it work. Suggestions welcome!

        <p>Really interesting idea. I&#39;m not great with numbers, so how do the odds of success stack against the dice?</p>

        <p>That&#39;s what I was wondering. I increased the ranges a bit, but I still don&#39;t think it&#39;s the same probability. it&#39;s WAY more even across the board.</p>

        <p>Really cool mechanics-wise, but I have a tough time reconciling it with any kind of fiction in the game world. I mean, a dragon breathes fire at you, so you... draw a card and succeed at... something? I get that the whole thing is based on the idea of &quot;Better lucky than good,&quot; but this feels way more D&amp;D than DW.</p>

        <p>To me this almost seems more like an alternate resolution system than a class, subbing in cards for dice rolls. Or possibly some way of playing a card game through a character. Like +Marty H says, the mechanics themselves are interesting but it doesnt really have any fictional basis as a class. At least not that I can see.</p>

        <p>very true. I think that&#39;s the biggest problem. I&#39;d have to add a lot more fluff to the moves to have them make sense. What about someone who can alter the fabric of reality? change probability itself? create insane coincidences that would be literally impossible?<br /><br />Like, &quot;An orc charges you with his ax, two archers fire behind him, and you&#39;re the target of them all, what do you do?&quot;<br />Cardshark &quot;I trust the Gods of chaos, draw a glowing card from my deck, and slap it to the ground. Jack. A shockwave passes outward, that only I can see. The trajectories of the arrows alter slightly from a gust of wind, and both pierce the charging orc. I draw another card as I draw my sword, once again putting my life in the hands of fate....&quot;</p>

        <p>Or you can rip off Twisted Fate from League of Legends.</p>

        <p>I&#39;m pretty sure this would be the BESTÂ way to roll on a &quot;Western World&quot; or something</p>
