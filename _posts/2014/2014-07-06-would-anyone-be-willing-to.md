Would anyone be willing to give the Warlord class I&#39;m working on a once-over? I tend to take the seeds of ideas and run off in unusual directions with them, so if you find moves that don&#39;t fit the archetype in your opinion (or gaps where you think moves should be), feel free to let me know - thanks so much to anyone who takes the time!

        <p>There&#39;s a supplement coming out soon that deals with warfare. You may want to hold off until you see it first.</p>

The warband you command is a handful of loyal followers, like a group of Hirelings but codified.<br /><br />I am extremely interested in Inglorious, though, and am awaiting its release with no small amount of excitement, but since the bulk of the work on this class is already finished I thought I&#39;d get some feedback on it anyway.</p>
