Testing the buy-in ratio...<br /><br />I&#39;ve been having an idea. I&#39;ve thought about it for about a day, and the more I think about it, the better it sounds in my head.<br /><br />It&#39;s a <b>Choose Your Own Adventure</b> style podcast, where there&#39;s a group of maybe four players and one GM. Sessions won&#39;t be very long, maybe only between one or two hours, but after each episode, we&#39;ll ask the players for two or three &quot;GM decisions&quot;, something that the players won&#39;t know in advance, but will ultimately affect the outcome of and the shape of the game.<br /><br />It would be fun to GM. It would be like having the listeners answering the Stake Questions from a front in Dungeon World.
