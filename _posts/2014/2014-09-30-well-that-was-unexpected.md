Well, that was unexpected! We now have a party that is partially at-odds, in traditional Monsterhearts/Apocalypse World style. One helped the lizardmen take over a garrison (without excess bloodshed), and the other two fled from the lizardmen in order to find help.<br /><br />Though, I don&#39;t think there need to be any adjustments to make this work, which is cool. There&#39;ll just have bond moves that don&#39;t resolve much.

        <p>Actually, it sounds like they just made new bonds with each other. I think you can have more than 1 bond with a person</p>

        <p>Oh, yes. We have a couple of bonds relevant to the situation now!</p>
