So I finally got to run Dungeon World for my regular group.  I wasn&#39;t sure how they&#39;d take to it since  we often play games with quite a bit of crunch - Eclipse Phase being the most recent. It turned out they were quite happy, and after some mulling over the playbooks chose an elven druid, human cleric and a princess ( Michael Atlin&#39;s awesome Prince(ss) ). I was expecting a Brave-style princess but my wife surprised me  and opted for a middle-eastern style which set the tone nicely. During the questions we established that the elves were jungle-dwelling primitives with a shamanic culture, and the cleric was a priest of the god of knowledge charged with salvaging hidden knowledge and hiding that which proves dangerous.<br />     We began with them approaching a town, establishing that the princess had a message to deliver from her mother to a sage dwelling there. On arrival they discovered the town overrun with cultists, who turned out to be members of a rival church to the cleric&#39;s. Some sort of ritual was happening in the town centre which we haven&#39;t got to yet, but they beat up some cultists and began to get a feel for how the game flows.<br />     DW suits me down to the ground since I tend to run everything by the seat of my pants and the session went fairly smoothly. I probably need to up my game on describing the consequences of 6- results - the group managed at least 10 between them iirc.<br />   We&#39;re continuing the game next week so we&#39;ll see how it pans out.

        <p>Yeah, 6- are always a little tough to handle. Just keep in mind there should always be something lurking out there. On a 6-, let it out to play. Discern Realities and Spout Lore may by a bit hard to work 6- for, but there are a couple of tricks.<br /><br />For Discern Realities ask them what question they want an answer to and what they&#39;re doing to get it. A hard move, like revealing an unwelcome truth, should flow a little easier from that. <br /><br />For Spout Lore, you may want to not just give them the XP, but make it conditional on them treating some false statement with interesting consequences as true. </p>

        <p>Thanks Paul, we finished the game on (yet) another 6- from the cleric ( I&#39;m sure the player upset the dice gods in a previous life ), and they&#39;ve no idea what the consequence is ( to be honest nor do I, I have a number of ideas, I&#39;ll decide when we start again). <br />   </p>
