Any guidelines on creating new spells? My group and I seem to think that the latest levels of spells for the wizard are lacking arcane punch, so to speak.

        <p>My philosophy has been to allow custom spells once the player has pulled out their effects via ritual magic two or three times.  By then you&#39;ll have an idea just how much of an influence they spell will have on play, whether you want them to be able to do it at will, etc.  It puts the task of spell creation on the player, and the player who wants to be a wizard ought to own the whole &#39;magic&#39; thing like the cleric ends up explaining the pantheon(s), the fighter explains how the different cultures have different soldiering styles and the strengths and weaknesses of each, the bard makes up long-standing rumors, etc.</p>
