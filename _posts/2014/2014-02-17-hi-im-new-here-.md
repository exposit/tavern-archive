Hi,<br /><br />I&#39;m new here - just reading through some of the amazing DW &quot;adventure starters&quot; that I&#39;ve stumbled across online (see link below). I have a question about this line that I often see crop up as one of the GM Goals: &quot;Fill out your worksheet&quot;.<br /><br />What is a GM worksheet? How does it get filled out during play? (I understand that it is something to do with fronts, grim portents, etc. - but I&#39;d like some more info). <br /><br />More: I am really very impressed with the materials that people are  developing (and sharing) for &quot;sparking&quot; adventures - I was much more used to detailed, fully specified, often heavily plotted adventure &quot;modules&quot; - with these it often felt that to the extent that they were rich and interesting and story-driven they were often also prone to railroading. Adventure starters and sparkers and fronts and microfronts and suchlike seem much more interesting...

<a href='http://dragonsinmyhouse.blogspot.co.uk/2014/01/dungeon-world-adventure-starters.html'>Dungeon World - Dungeon Starters and Adventure Starter list</a>


I have been unable to find an up to date version elsewhere, so I decided to prepare a list of the available Dungeon Starters, Adventure Starters, and adventures for DW (WIP, it will be updated as I find them). Feel free to no...

        <p>If the &quot;GM worksheets&quot; were mentioned in conjunction with the Dungeon Starters, it&#39;s because the text was written well before the final version of the handouts was released and I didn&#39;t know what they&#39;d be called.  The sheet they are referencing is one of the last pages of the official character sheet marked <i>The GM</i>.  If they&#39;re from something else they probably mean the Front sheets.</p>

        <p>Hi Marshall - thanks for answering.<br /><br />(The worksheets that I&#39;m talking about are mentioned in your adventure starters (e.g., The Goblin Hole, under &quot;Goals&quot;).<br /><br />The PDF of character classes (at least the one that I&#39;ve found) does have some stuff for the GM at the end - one page of bullet points for various stuff (Principles, Moves, Dungeon Moves, Monsters) and a few blank forms for different kinds of fronts (Campaign Front, regular Front) - but nothing that looks like what I imagine might be meant by a worksheet?)<br /><br />Anyway, I&#39;m more interested in what you do with it - is it a place to record the front-relevant or campaign-relevant stuff that you get from the players during play? Or is it for ticking off the portents as they happen? Or something else that I&#39;m not thinking of?<br /><br />The fact that filling it out is listed as a GM &quot;goal&quot; (rather than just something that tends to happen like dice rolls or whatnot) suggests to me that one mark of a good session might be that the worksheet got filled out good, whereas,  conversely, a session that fell flat might show that in its worksheet too?<br /><br />I guess I&#39;m just interested in the thinking here. (I am no doubt over thinking this myself). </p>

        <p>I have been running DW by the seat of my pants, so I am interested in answers to the question &quot;what is a GM worksheet&quot; also.  I have trouble filling them out.</p>

        <p>We just write all around the edges of the campaign map. If I have a stake question I&#39;m interested in.... BOOM, I write it on the edge of the map, If an NPC / monster / location comes up? Its written down on the campaign map; there is usually a little &#39;roster&#39; of folks that live in various towns written next to the town.<br />Player Characters / Important NPCs / monsters tend to get a Pathfinder character art card, with a sticky note on the back having their &#39;stat block&#39;. These live in groups that can be shifted as required - its also handy for visually setting up a &#39;triangle&#39; and pushing at the bonds connections of filling their lives with adventure.<br />On the Fronts / dangers sheet go more detail for the GM and I tend to write countdowns on index cards; with each card being a &#39;step&#39; in the countdown and a narrative cue. The cards are placed on the table in a stack, and as I&#39;m handed a golden opportunity, the cards are revealed one by one with the last card revealing the impending doom at the end.</p>

        <p>Cool - so players can see the stack dwindling and feel the big doom coming.<br /><br />What do you mean by a &#39;triangle&#39;?</p>

        <p>Its from Apocalpyse World, and basically means whenever a monster or NPC is discovered to be important in the fiction, you label their 2 divergent relationships with PCs - complicating their existing bonds, forming an unstable (shifting) triangle of relationship.<br />These labels are easy to imagine using a little inspiration from the monster&#39;s or NPC&#39;s instinct and want.<br /><br />This ends up just being a simple triangular relationship map on paper, the lines labelled with a word or phrase.<br /><br />So the fighter might distrust their fellow party member thief, but need the crimelord&#39;s help in recovering their stolen signature weapon, whilst the crimelord might be hopelessly nfatuated with the fighter&#39;s thews. Meanwhile the crimeboss wants to make an example of the thief since they never pay their dues. We know that the thief has stolen (and hocked) the fighter&#39;s signature weapon and has a bond with them: as an easy romantic set-up to pay off their debt to the crimeboss....<br /><br />Then you have an instant situational set-up, all you need to do is add a location and you&#39;ll have an adventure-filled scene.</p>

        <p>Wow. ... So maybe I should read Apocalypse World too? Maybe some of the cool stuff in DW will resolve more clearly for me when I read AW?</p>

        <p>Hmmm.  It can&#39;t hurt to read AW, especially for the MC chapter and advanced fuckery, but its not necessary - plus its an awesome game that spawned all of these &#39;hacks&#39; for a reason!</p>

        <p>Yeah, the AW rules are written in a way that may not appeal to all folks ;)</p>
