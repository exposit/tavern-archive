Are there any other poisons other than the initial four listed in the book?  I suspect my thief may get a little bored.  :-)

        <p>Why not ask the thief about it?﻿ <br /><br />I bet they know about that one that steals your voice. ....or that one that gives you really soft skin over night unless you&#39;re a goblin - what was that one called?</p>

        <p>In my experience, not an issue. Enjoy throwing the concept of &quot;game balance&quot; out of the window :)<br />then again, if you have some cool idea yourself about poisons, you can surely put them in the game and see what happens...</p>

        <p>Yeah. Balance isn&#39;t really an issue in DW. No matter how powergame-y a player gets, they still have to A) trigger the move with appropriate narrations and B) risk getting a 6- when they roll.</p>

        <p>RE: fear of &quot;powergamer&quot; abuses - remember to always say, &quot;Yes, and...&quot; or &quot;Yes, but...&quot; Think of the wizard&#39;s Ritual move: rituals are always possible, but the GM says what it takes to make it happen. Applying that to poisons, so the player says they know of a poison that instantly kills anyone who so much as smells it? Awesome; something that dangerous must be rare, hard to find, and/or well-guarded. Not to mention how hard it must be to hold your breath long enough to transport it somewhere you can harm your enemies with it, or the possibility the legends are exaggerated, and so on and so forth. That&#39;s the stuff epic adventures are made of right there.</p>

        <p>The Thief Advanced Move &quot;Alchemist&quot; states that &quot;Alternately you can describe the effects of a poison you’d like to create. The GM will tell you that you can create it, but with one or more caveats:<br />•  It will only work under specific circumstances<br />•  The best you can manage is a weaker version<br />•  It’ll take a while to take effect<br />•  It’ll have obvious side effects&quot;</p>

        <p>Paranoia poison harvested from a trilobitey thingy. My BESM chatacter had it for ages after harvesting it from a monster he fought. Last night we wanted to invade a seedy pub that was also the headquarters of a saugage smuggling cartell. Dropped it in the Soup of the Day and waited outside till the clientele started killing each other...<br />Be creative an let it flow from the fiction. You fight a poisonous Kraken? Let the thief harvest its glands </p>
