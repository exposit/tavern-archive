I&#39;m a big fan of Batman Arkham XYZ. I wonder, is there a way to capture the feel of combat in that game?

        <p>You stand defiant, cape bellowing in the cold wind, as several clown masked goons surround you, jeering and cracking their knuckles.<br /><br />What do you do?<br /><br />--&quot;I punch the nearest guy in the gut!&quot; This is a Hack and Slash, let&#39;s say with a roll of 8, meaning the goon gets a punch in of his own.<br /><br />Another goon swings for you with a metal pipe, roll to Defy Danger!<br /><br />--&quot;I&#39;ll roll Dex to swiftly move under his swing and come up close to him.&quot; Roll of 10, so it happens as planned, I&#39;ll even throw in that he knocks the first goon off his feet, because it works logically and with the kind of pulp fiction we&#39;re going for.<br /><br />.<br /><br />I could be wrong but I think thats like the Arkham games, right?<br /><br />You could have a custom move like, erm...<br /><br />When you attack two enemies at once in melee, roll+Str.<br />✴On a 10+, you spread your damage between both enemies.<br />✴On a 7–9, you spread your damage between both enemies and one enemy makes an attack against you.</p>

        <p>I am the Night.<br /><br />When you say &quot;I am the Night&quot; or &quot;I&#39;m Batman&quot; completely seriously, hold 1. At any time within the night you may:<br />✴Redirect an attack from yourself to an enemy<br />✴Halve the attack’s effect or damage<br />✴Disappear while Commissioner Gordon is talking<br />✴Have a flashback where you learnt a skill useful right now<br />✴Deal damage to an attacker equal to your level<br /><br />Okay I&#39;m done.</p>

        <p>It would take some reconfiguring of the Hack and Slash move, but DW and Arkham share something in common - the concept of momentum. The fights in those games feel like they flow (a bit like a Zack Snyder fight scene) from high-speed to slow-mo and back and forth. So it&#39;s like, you hit the thug but there&#39;s another one coming and can you keep up your combat momentum or do you miss a block and get a pipe to the head?</p>

        <p>Whenever you inspire fear by being devious, gain +1 Tactic. At any time you can execute your strategy:  Get +1 forward (cost 1), Deal your damage to an enemy (cost 2), create a distraction or obstacle that the enemy must deal with before doing anything else (cost 3), the GM will help you reveal a great plan that puts you in a clear advantage (cost 4)<br /><br />Greatly inspired by the Battlemaster Gambit move in Grim World.</p>

        <p>The Walker, from Inverse World, is pretty much built to be Arkham * Batman.</p>

        <p>Inverse World was kickstarted but hasn&#39;t yet been released. Just getting the name out there for you.</p>

        <p>Ah.<br /><br />I think the RAW rules would work just fine, especially with some genre-appropriate basic and advanced moves. But I was pondering potentially trying something a bit different, just for the sake of being different.<br /><br />In THE REGIMENT they use an entirely different system for combat. Has anybody tried it out? Does it play as wonky as it reads?</p>
