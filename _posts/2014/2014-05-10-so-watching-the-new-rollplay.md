So watching the new Rollplay Vigil I noticed something I&#39;ve myself noticed playing Dungeon World. People are so used the the Dungeons and Dragons model of doing things where the GM controls everything that they have an aversion to creating anything of the narrative and the world themselves. So how do you encourage people to get on the games wavelength? That you as a player also control the narrative and the world

        <p>&quot;so, you are now in the palace of the duke. PC#1, describe the Duke to the group and tell me a secret about him. Something just the two of you know. PC#2 what happened the last time you met with the duke? PC#3 who do you know in service of the duke, and how you know them?&quot;<br />and so on... of course not all the time every session, but if you do it right at the start, they&#39;ll be engaged and understand that, although you&#39;re playing an elf mage, this isn&#39;t D&amp;D!</p>

        <p>Poke them with it until they do it. If they have no own ideas, give them two things to choose between.</p>

        <p>Specific questions help. Less &quot;what do you know about the duke?&quot; and more &quot;What did you spot the Duke&#39;s advisor doing when he thought nobody was watching?&quot; or &quot;The blade the Duke is holding, where have you seen it before?&quot;</p>

        <p>Also, each player is different. Someone like to answer specific little question, other prefer to throw some idea on the big picture.<br />They only have to shift what they did on the background of their PC before starting to play to when they really play</p>

        <p>Be extra careful to address questions to the character, not the player. <br /><br />So not, &quot;Bob, tell us why goblins have such a beef with the civilized races&quot; but rather &quot;Ovid, you&#39;ve read all about goblins.  According to Bathoos the Elder, why are they so aggravated by the civilized races?&quot; </p>

        <p>Asking questions that are easy to answer. I tend to ask questions and posit a few answers for players who aren&#39;t totally ready to pick things themselves.<br /><br />&quot;Why are you with these Elves, knowing that they betrayed humanity? Are you just that forgiving, or do you have another motive?&quot;</p>

        <p>Give them narrative control over the things they have selected during character creation. ARe they the only dwarf? Then they are the expert on all things dwarvish in your dungeon world.<br />Fighters know all about murdering things, so they are expert in regards to this. So when a question comes up about fighting or death or weapons, well the player who is playing the fighter is your first port of call - get them to answer those questions. If it seems a bit of a stretch as they wax lyrical... &#39;Sounds like you are spouting lore to me...&#39; Roll the dice.</p>

        <p>I try to ask them questions about the world during character creation. I try to make sure they know I don&#39;t really have anything created ahead of time - we&#39;re just doing what they want to do. <br /><br />Sometimes, none of that will work. Some players don&#39;t want narrative control. That&#39;s fine. If they&#39;re having fun, I&#39;m happy.</p>
