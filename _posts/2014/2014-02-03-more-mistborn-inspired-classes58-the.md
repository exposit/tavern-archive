        <p>I don&#39;t think Kinetic Energy is a good idea of a move since there is no link back to the fiction. </p>

Kinetic energy allows you to spend all the energy you have stored. you can store bits of energy over a long period of time, and then burn them all at once in a big feat of amazingness. </p>

        <p>Why not make it then, <br />spend 1 charge to do<br />x<br />y<br />z<br /><br />spend 3 charges to do<br />a<br />b<br />c<br /><br />a bit like a Druid would. Or take this move as an inspritation: <br /><br />Indomitable: when you go into battle, roll+hard. On a 10+, hold 3. On a 7–9, hold 2. On a miss, hold 1, but take -1forward. During the battle you can spend your hold 1 for 1 to:<br />• Name an npc within your reach. You kill, disable or disarm them (MC’s choice). • Name a character within your reach. You redirect their attack to another<br />character within your reach, or else to nowhere — into the ground or a wall or<br />the sky.<br />• Name a character on the scene, but outside your reach. You cross the distance<br />between you before they have time to adjust or react.<br />• Name a character within your reach. While you keep fighting, you intercept any<br />attack directed at them and they suffer no harm.<br />• Ignore all harm to yourself from an incoming attack.</p>

        <p>yeah! I totally plan on having additional moves that you can spend charges on. I wanted to have a MAIN mechanic that this class could use in lieu of moves. But you&#39;re right, this doesn&#39;t have the same fictional power, especially if you haven&#39;t read Mistborn. But I wanted to give this class more flexiblility, in addition to the typical, &quot;spend 3 charges, roll+3 and choose 3&quot;</p>

        <p>But the main mechanic is <br />&quot;let get some minuses over here to later get a plus over there&quot; <br /><br />You are covered with Iron but you can especially choose when this is hindering to you. Why isn&#39;t it always hindering? <br /><br />All this class does is allowing you to fail when you want to and succeed when you really want to do that. It is purely mechanical. </p>

        <p>Also this note is not true: <br /><b>GM Note</b> to prevent abuse of gaining charges, remember that <br />players should only roll whenever there is the potential for failure and <br />negative consequences. <br /><br />compare p. 16</p>

        <p>ah! okay, I see your critique now. Hmmmm....I think there is a fine line between mechanics and fiction. For example, the fighter&#39;s signature weapon is reliant upon tags and properties, not just fictional justification. Meanwhile, the Druid is almost entirely determined by the fiction, this the mechanical specifics incredibly vague. (hence a lot of the controversy over the Druid)</p>

        <p>I could see something like rolling +tincharges as a mechanic that would work. <br /><br />The alignments however need work too. They should motivate you to do something you wouldn&#39;t normally do. <br />Outsider is good. <br />Solder: you would do that anyway. That is what the move is for. <br />Student: you would also probarbly do that. Depending on how literal you take this, this could also be impossible to fulfill because you can spend charges when you roll+bond. </p>

What if I made a class FOCUSED on rolling dice. It would be totally 4th wall breaking, but it could be fun to play.</p>

        <p>Okay next thing, powergaming. The way i might play this class would be to always impede myself on a roll with my best stat to be awesome at my worst stats. So having a high STR and INT maybe, always rolling these stats with a -1 penalty to later rock with all my other stats. <br /><br />Alternatively, highly penalising myself on rolls that i suck at anyway to farm XP. <br /><br />On a fictional level i can understand that wearing a lof of stuff on your body might hinder you on a physical level. But then it either hinders you or it doesn&#39;t. You don&#39;t get to decide that after 3 times being effed by your armor now suddenly it is not a problem anymore. <br />But how does wearing a lot of tin make you bad at making INT,CHA,WIS rolls? What is the fictional reason for that? The class doesn&#39;t explain that. </p>

        <p>and i think heavily breaking the 4th wall all the time would suck in dungeon world since it creates fiction that is highly weird and illogical. </p>

        <p>In Mistborn, a Ferumancer can store physical characteristics. So if they spend 3 days being weak, slow, and blind, then they can burn that energy being strong, fast, and have good visions for 3 days OR they can burn all the energy at once, and throw a truck at someone.</p>

        <p>it might be better just letting people build charges with a couple moves, and spend charges with other moves. Instead of the direct roll penalties and bonuses.</p>
