The kids I DM for cleared out a castle full of devils who had invaded Hades. I rolled up treasure for them and got, among other things, &quot;some minor magical trinket,&quot; so I figured that two Barbs of the Black Gate would be an appropriate reward. I described two twisted iron spikes which the cleric of Hades recognized from his appearance before the Black Gates the last time he died.<br /><br />The fighter then decided to see what one did by hammering it into his own skull.<br /><br />I spent what must have been a good five minutes staring at this kid in disbelief and asking him if he was sure he wanted to do this. He was 100% sure. I asked the other kids if they wanted to interfere. They were sure they didn&#39;t.<br /><br />&quot;Okay,&quot; I said. &quot;You die.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;I heal him,&quot; said the cleric.<br /><br />&quot;You can&#39;t,&quot; I said, explaining the effects of the Barb.<br /><br />&quot;Okay, I resurrect him,&quot; said the cleric.<br /><br />&quot;You can&#39;t do that either. He&#39;s just dead. No ghost, no undead, no resurrection, nothing.&quot;<br /><br />They are now hauling his corpse in a cart to Hades&#39;s citadel so that Hades himself can bring him back to life in exchange for information.

        <p>&quot;I hammer it into my skull.&quot;<br /><br />LOL.<br /><br />More than the impossible, players will always do the unintended.</p>

        <p>While that is awesome, the kid may have just been doing it for LOLZ rather than intentionally making a statement. Good on them for sticking with it and accepting the consequences rather than trying to take it back.</p>
