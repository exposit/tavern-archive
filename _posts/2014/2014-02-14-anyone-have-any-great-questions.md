Anyone have any great questions to begin a campaign or a one-shot with? <br /><br />I love throwing one big leading question at my players to set the tone for the whole night. Things like:<br /><br />&quot;What are you doing on this flying island, and why is it crashing?&quot;<br /><br />&quot;A sacred torch has protected this city for a century - what happens the night it goes out?&quot;<br /><br />I&#39;m going to be running some one shots with my in-person table, and looking to put together a good long list to draw from for awhile. Any ideas would be helpful!

        <p>What beast is chasing you? <br />Who is Riding it?<br />Where are you running? <br />Where are you running from?<br />This worked well a few times for me</p>

        <p>Each of you remembers one or two flashes of another player&#39;s past, but each of your own is a blur.<br /><br />Write these secrets down and who they are about (try to even these out across players/characters) and share them with the GM. Great potential for story hooks here.<br /><br />Final bit is collectively deciding (players, perhaps with GM coaching/ruling) what brought about their collective amnesia, whether any of their characters remember it (or had anything to do with it) and what to do about recovering those lost memories.<br /><br />This could work equally well with allowing players to grant personality traits, skills, etc on one another (within reason/player acceptance) or similar.</p>

        <p>Why are you in this dank prison cell, and who is this person who just blew a hole in the wall to break you out?<br /><br />What do you hope to bring out with you from the fortress you are currently sneaking into?<br /><br />Why are you standing in a forest, circled by scowling centaurs?<br /><br />You stand upon a bloody battlefield strewn with corpses. What events led to this catastrophe, and what are you mourning most?<br /><br />You&#39;re standing on the docks, watching a returning ship come in. What is it bringing that you care most about?<br /><br />What do you have with you that the pursuers bearing down on you want to kill you for?<br /><br />Why are you in a room high in a wizard&#39;s tower with 3 dead wizards?<br /><br />Why are you hanging onto a rickety raft careening down the rapids, about to go over a huge waterfall?</p>

        <p>When did you last see the giant ogre? Who or what did he take from you? How do you know he&#39;s not dead yet?</p>

        <p>Why are you covered in shit in the middle of the King&#39;s court?<br /><br />What just battered you through the cathedral window?<br /><br />Who is banging on your front door at this time of night?<br /><br />Why is it your fault the three tribes are at war?<br /><br />Why are you seeking the Fountain of Youth?<br /><br />When does the Eon Calendar, and the thus the world, end?<br /><br />What will you do now the local heroes have fallen to the Necromancer?<br /><br />Why are you on a mission to save an orc sentenced to death?<br /><br />Why are you about to summon Death?</p>

        <p>Dread is a great game for these sorts of leading questions, and you might want to look through its modules for some good ones.  I really like using them to start things off.  Have you thought about getting your players to ask them of each other?  Like, go around and ask each character a question (to give them examples), then go around two more times to have anyone ask each character a question.  Some groups can&#39;t come up with good ones on the spot, but some people might surprise you in the best way.<br /><br />Why don&#39;t the rats come anywhere near your room?<br />Did you actually commit the crime that put you in jail ten years ago?<br />Why don&#39;t you trust the wizard?<br />What did you steal from the fighter, and why?<br />What&#39;s that thing growing on the back of your neck?</p>

        <p>Questions that have gone well for me:<br /><br />Why is the king so angry with you?<br /><br />Where are you sailing to?<br /><br />Why are you running?<br /><br />One of my favorite follow up questions is, &quot;Whose fault is it?&quot;</p>

        <p>What is on the other side of these mountains that you are braving their treacherous precipices and howling blizzards for?<br /><br />Where were you going before you got shipwrecked and washed ashore on this beach? Who is coming down the sand towards you?<br /><br />Why are you fleeing town? Why is the smell of smoke in the air?<br /><br />Whose funeral are you at? Why is there so much tension amongst the attendees?<br /><br />Why are you groveling before this towering demon?<br /><br />What urgent message must you give the king? Why won&#39;t he listen?<br /><br />(If there is a Wizard in the party:) What ritual are you preparing for? What will happen to your home if you fail?<br /><br />Why is the local Mage&#39;s Guild closing up shop? Why is the former Guild Leader trying to find you?<br /><br />Who are you lying in wait for in this alley this late at night?<br /><br />Why are you caught between two marauding warbands? What prevents you from helping either side?<br /><br />Who is this dwarf (or elf, halfling, etc. - pick one of your players&#39; races) you are chasing? Why must you kill him? Who will try to avenge his death?</p>
