        <p>Let them play the same class or let them work it out between themselves.¬†<br />Or both pitch a character concept for the class and the table decides what they like better, don&#39;t know.¬†</p>

        <p>Let them duel that shit out as the same playbook first! The survivor goes on to the game. Let the other players vote who made a better, or more entertaining move, step by step. Each good move earns a point.</p>

        <p>This is why I only come to the session with one copy of each character printed. How are you going to play the same playbook when there&#39;s only one?</p>

        <p>We sometimes play what&#39;s called &quot;The Example Game.&quot; The two in question get a sheet of paper and a pencil. Sixty second time limit, name all cultural examples of that type of character. Go. The most applicable examples win.</p>

        <p>Roll a die, high roll gets that playbook, loser chooses a different one.¬† In the next campaign, you may not play the same playbook as the last campaign, so now the other player can play that class.</p>
