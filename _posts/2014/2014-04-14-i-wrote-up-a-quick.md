I wrote up a quick blog post for Players. There&#39;s so much advice for GMs, but not as much for players. Let me know if you find this useful, or If there are other resources I can include. Happy Gaming!

A Tabletop game refers to any kind of role-playing game that doesn't rely on computers or electronics. Instead, there are several players who contribute to the game, making choices, and solving problems. You (the player) will create an avatar (your character) who will interact with the world.
