I need some Kobold Warren inspiration. How have those filthy, sneaky monsters made their lair simply horrible for unwanted guests. Give me some impressions and sticky situations. Thanks!

        <p>They dig a shallow pit, and cover it with an off color sheet of fabric covered with dirt.  Underneath all this, sharp stakes have been dug.  Near the stakes, bloodflies lnger, waiting for their next meal...</p>

        <p>It depends on what kobolds are like in your setting ... Are they the weak but cunning trap-makers depicted by Tucker, or are they something else?<br /><br />What do your players know about them? <br /><br />What have they heard? Are those rumors true, or are they just stories that aren&#39;t connected with the truth?<br /><br />Perhaps your kobolds <b>*are*</b> small cunning trap making bipeds, but they don&#39;t stay small, and just keep on growing and growing and eventually turn into dragons. <br /><br />Perhaps dragons lay thousands of eggs in dungeons, and they hatch into kobolds, who menace adventurers in a tucker-like way until they experience the quickening and morph into dragons ...<br /><br />How much must those little guys have to eat, and how aggressive would they get to change into a dragon?<br /><br />Maybe they eat each other (and anything else) until there is only one left and that one becomes a dragon? <br /><br />Sounds like a bad dungeon to be stuck in ...</p>

        <p>Wich makes me wonder again. Are kobolds like dogs or like lizards?</p>

        <p>I&#39;m pretty sure I remember them being dogs in the red box of the BECMI d&amp;d that I first played and then later editions they were suddenly lizardy ...<br /><br />You could always have them dog-men morphing into giant dog-things, rather than lizard-men morphing into lizard-things if you prefer!</p>

        <p>I suggest reading The Tunnels of Cu Chi, or anything else about the tunnel complexes made by the VC/NVA. Then adapt for fantasy world...</p>

        <p>But you asked for impressions...here goes...<br /><br />The warren stinks. It&#39;s eye-watering bad, and the musk and ammonia stench makes your throat and nose hurt. <br /><br />It&#39;s small. Perfectly open for 3-4 foot tall creatures, but humans and their ilk must bend over or crawl - so cramped, and so vulnerable...<br /><br />It&#39;s dark, and even if you have light sources, the constant turns and twists mean you never really can see more than 10 feet or so. <br /><br />Sounds are deceiving. Sometimes there&#39;s chittering from everywhere, other times the ambushes are completely silent. What can be clearly heard are the cries of anguish of your captured comrades...<br /><br />Finally, you can stand up, an honest 10&#39; x 10&#39; corridor...and now the little bastards bring in their wolf/warg cavalry, shooting poisoned arrows and then running away, far faster than you can pursue, dragging a lassoed companion with them...</p>

        <p>Checking in, had some great inspiration here and the party is quickly regretting entering the warrens at all. An obvious spiked pit trap turned out to be much more. The weight from the first adventurer walking carefully across the bottom opened a flood gate which knocked the other party members in and then flushed them down into an Otyoughs lair. They have no idea how they are going to escape these kobolds alive.</p>
