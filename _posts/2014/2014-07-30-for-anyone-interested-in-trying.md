For anyone interested in trying DW in a  Play-by-Post format, one of the groups I&#39;m GMing has spots for 1 or 2 more.  It&#39;s a pirate themed setting and further details are provided in my latest post through the  link (GM Mogthrasir).<br /><br />First one or two to post interest on that forum will start work with me on building your dream pirate.<br /><br />No previous DW or PBP games necessary.  I don&#39;t mind teaching as long as you don&#39;t mind me going through a learning process as well.<br /><br /><a href="http://paizo.com/campaigns/HoistTheBlackFlag/recruiting&amp;page=last" class="ot-anchor">http://paizo.com/campaigns/HoistTheBlackFlag/recruiting&amp;page=last</a>
