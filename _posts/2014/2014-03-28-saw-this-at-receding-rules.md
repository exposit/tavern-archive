Saw this at Receding Rules, and couldn&#39;t help but think it would make the basis for a great custom move:<br /><br />Pick Lock/Disarm Trap<br />   When you attempt to pick a lock or disarm a trap roll+DEX. On a 10+, you have 2 chances, on a 7-9 you get 1. The GM will tell you the rating of the lock or trap, and you have to make guesses using only the verbs “bump”, “twist”, “rake” or “probe”. Do this in the correct order, and you&#39;re successful. The rating on the lock also functions as it&#39;s vulnerability to damage; the higher the rating the more likely it is to jam or break. For each failed attempt roll a d6; rolling under the rating breaks or jams the lock.

Arkhein asked how to make lockpicking interesting. Here's my attempt: Your thief knows four ways to manipulate locks: Bump; Probe; Rake; Twist. And that's it. She knows the wrong actions might Jam the lock permanently preventing it from being picked or opened with a key.

        <p>Why do you have to guess the order? It&#39;s an inappropriate mechanism. I know to pick a Yale lock, you apply rotational pressure while prodding the pins; but would likely fail &#39;cos I&#39;ve never tried. Surely a thief will know what to do with a given lock merely by looking.</p>

        <p>Sounds a lot more convoluted than Tricks of the Trade, which any thief worth her salt will overcome over half the time.<br /><br />I think this mechanic has its appeal, but as presented (even in the article), it sounds like the work and prep time is not worth the payoff (especially if you try to keep a list of locks with similar traits, like dwarf locks and the like).<br /><br />Maybe in a special circumstance, like a <i>very</i> complex lock or magical lock.</p>

        <p>Having reread Tricks of the Trade I see that it is a much more convoluted mechanic (nobody in my group is a thief, so we never use it). The fun I think in using this move is in the drama it can create, but I&#39;m not sure that it wouldn&#39;t get stale or annoying with multiple failures or uses. ﻿YMMV</p>

        <p>It also makes this about your skill or luck as a person, not about the one of your character. But I guess this was mentioned before.</p>
