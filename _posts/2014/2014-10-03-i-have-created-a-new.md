I have created a new playbook: Planewalker v1.1 ! The planewalker is a low powered assisting class at first, but can get much stronger. Limited power over time and space, a type of psychic/psionic.<br />If a few of you are willing to playtest and are interested, email me at hessians79@gmail.com

        <p>Would this be an online playtest or would you like (any and each of) us to test it on our groups?</p>

        <p>I would like it if you guys would try running it in groups. I&#39;d also be willing to do a pbp game. Of course it&#39;s rough right now, and GMs may have to adapt it to make it work. </p>

        <p>I run one shots, and I&#39;m sure someone in my group would be willing to playtest your class</p>
