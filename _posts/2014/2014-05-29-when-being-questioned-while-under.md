When being questioned while under the effects of (the Truthspeak spell, the Grand Inquisitor of Elik the Reaping&#39;s gaze, too much booze, etc) roll + CHR and obey the results for the remainder of the conversation.<br />10 +  : Your character can say whatever they like.<br />7-9 : Your character cannot directly lie, but can lie by omission or balance their statements to give false impressions.<br />6- : Not only can you not lie, either in spirit or literally, you feel compelled to answer any questions.  You also blurt out something ... unfortunate... and true.  The GM may &#39;help&#39; you with coming up with your error.

        <p>Great move, I wish this was a core basic move. It seems it would have more usage than what I see with the Parley, not that it would be a replacement by any means.</p>

        <p>Well, this move seems to have an entertaining spin on a conversation. I&#39;m not saying it should replace it, as Parley has a different outcome, purpose, and requirement.<br /><br />I can&#39;t force players to have to talk through a situation. I can open opportunities as much as I want for players, but that doesn&#39;t mean that they are going to use it, calling for me to run the Parley roll.</p>

        <p>Definitely not a replcement for parley. This move has its own legs.</p>
