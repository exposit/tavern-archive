I put together an Illusionist compendium class + some new Illusion spells for my nephew, who wasn&#39;t too happy about trading in his D&amp;D gnome illusionist for a DW gnome wizard. I&#39;d love any feedback you have on this.<br /><br />I have a feeling it may be overpowered, but it was hard to strike a balance here. I think when it comes to illusions, the power comes mostly from creative ideas rather than the spells themselves, so it makes it tricky to balance things out. I&#39;d rather err on the side of being too strong, though, as long as it makes for a good story.

        <p>How do you <br />&quot;discover your innate ability to alter creatures’ perceptions&quot; ?<br /><br /><br />What is the purpose of the Magical Aura spell? <br />And why can&#39;T you cast other spells why you have it up? <br />Any why doesn&#39;t it give the normal -1 to spells that ongoing brings with it usually? <br />Knockoff, why is this a spell and not a move? When none of the effects of the spell happen then you are just chanting and waving your hands around aren&#39;t you? Or is this &quot;illusionary spell&quot; that has all the visual etc. information but not the actual effects? <br /><br />Ghostly senses<br />&quot;• It requires all of your attention to concentrate on the creature. Take -1 ongoing until you release your focus.&quot; <br /><br />shouldn&#39;t it be enough that you have to focus fully on that thing? That will limit what you do a lot. Giving a -1 ongoing implies you can do other things while concentrating on seeing the thing. Doing something else while concentrating would be Defy Danger in my game, no need for an extra -1 there i think. <br /><br />There is a typo there with sight i think. On the <br />Add one or more senses:<br /><br />Otherwise this looks okay. </p>

        <p>Thanks <span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink" href="https://plus.google.com/110330901807759406775" oid="110330901807759406775">Tim Franzke</a></span>! I uploaded a new version with some updates based on your suggestions. I fixed the trigger for the CC, which was too vague. <br /><br />The Magical Aura spell is meant to act like D&amp;D&#39;s Nystul&#39;s Magic Aura spell. I included that specifically for use in our campaign, where back in the day, the gnome would use the spell to sell fake magic items for profit.<br /><br />I liked the idea of changing over Knockoff into a move, so I gave a go at it. But then it felt like I was missing a level 3 spell, so I added a new (weird) one.<br /><br />Also... great point about the concentration choices. Your suggestion is more in line with what I was thinking, but I just wasn&#39;t sure if it would be clear in the choice. I dropped the ongoing penalty and just left it at &quot;requires all your concentration.&quot;</p>
