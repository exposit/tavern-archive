Ok we played a once off last night. As the party killed the BBEG (a wizard) he muttered with his last breath &quot;I invoke the powers of Sea and Ice&quot;  The next moment the forest glade was buried under a tsunami of water and glacial ice. The GM informed us,  &quot;You have three seconds to react or die&quot;. Eveybody was reduced to zero Hp. Me (bombardier named Black Bart) and the druid survived last breath. Death gave the ranger the option of becoming a priestess in a necropolis - she refused. So everybody died except the bombardier and druid who collected the bounty for killing the wiz.<br /><br />It was pretty awesome. Two newbie teenage girls played, and I am pretty sure they&#39;ll be back!﻿

        <p>&quot;You have 3 seconds to react - but you are dead anyway&quot;? </p>

The druid changed into an eagle but thought she could save the bard. The bard was too heavy...</p>

        <p>I&#39;m just amazed at fantastic power death curses.  Seams like something the party should have known about and had a counter too.</p>

        <p>seems a little heavy-handed, imho, unless they received some sort of advanced warning, aside from &quot;the BBEG is a wizard.&quot;  Then again, I don&#39;t have Grim World yet, so maybe this death curse thing is something everyone routinely does?</p>

        <p>It was sort of expected that there would be a TPK since it was a once off... <b>It gave the session a real epic feel.</b> And yes, it fits in nicely with the Grim World death moves. I would definitely not recommend killing the party like this in an ongoing campaign. :-)﻿ You may just lose your gaming group.</p>
