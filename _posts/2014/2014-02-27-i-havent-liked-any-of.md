I haven&#39;t liked any of the shapeshifter classes that I&#39;ve seen so far, so I made my own, and based it off of the Kandra from Brian Sanderson&#39;s Mistborn series (great books!)<br /><br />I&#39;ve also updated the Allomancer Playbook from the same series.<br /><br />The Kandra relies on switching from playbook to playbook. It isn&#39;t for everyone, and there are severe limitations. But it&#39;s more of what I imagine a shapeshifter would be like.

        <p>The main problem here is usability at the table. When creating basically your new character you take up 5 minutes where you are just not playing.Â </p>

        <p>That&#39;s an acceptable cost when considering the race and the Setting in which its set. This is NOT something that should be happening on a regular basis anyway. Kandra take on a form and try to stay in that form for as long as possible unless it was an emergency form.</p>
