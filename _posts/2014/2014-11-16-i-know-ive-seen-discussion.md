I know I&#39;ve seen discussion of &quot;skills&quot;.  What is the communities overall feeling on this? My thought is something like Fate&#39;s aspects, 13th&#39;s backgrounds, or Numenera&#39;s skills:<br /><br />When you create a character write an experience that defines them; take +1 forward when that experience would be helpful. At level 2 and each level onward take another +1 forward to that experience or come up with another that does not replace prior(s).

        <p>My feeling is you don&#39;t need them at all. Moves often take the place of skills in Dungeon World, and when they don&#39;t, the fiction covers everything else.<br /><br />Also, +1 to a 2d6 roll is already a big bump. Increasing that by another +1 at every level would very quickly result in characters that could never fail in their skilled areas.</p>

        <p>World of Dungeons has skills. They just prevent characters from completely failing at something. Like, if you roll a 6- doing something you have a skill for, you still do it, but there are bad consequences.<br /><br />The Apocalypse Engine really breaks down once you have too many modifiers flying around. Because of that, if you implement a skill system, I would suggest doing it in a way that doesn&#39;t involve +1s.</p>

        <p>Yep, I was gonna say: moves = skills. They&#39;re much fancier skills. For an example, look at the Thief&#39;s Trap Expert move.</p>

        <p>You could use skills in PbtA, but that would not be DW. It would be a different game.</p>

        <p>Another fairly easy way to do it would be to just add a &quot;when you make use of a skill&quot; custom move and then have a skill list with skills rated on the -2 to +3 scale that AW hacks normally use. It would be a little weird, but that would get rid of the issue of carrying bonuses forward to other moves. Still, sometimes there might be some confusion over when to roll a skill versus rolling a basic or playbook move.</p>

        <p>You&#39;d honestly maybe want to hybridize attributes with skills.</p>

        <p>Skills could be used to substitute attribute mods in moves, such as   :<br />Lockpicking - when you are picking a lock or handling other mechanical systems and should be rolling a move, you can use lockpicking skill value in place of the attribute required by the move.<br />Keeping values from +1 to +3, it wouldn&#39;t break the system, but with a broad definition of skill, that feels like having another set of stats.<br /></p>

        <p>As others have said, moves really make skills obsolete in *World games. On the other hand, you could start with another engine like Fate or Cortex+ and hack in some of *World GM moves, principles, agendas and Hx/Bonds along with traditional skills.</p>

        <p>I&#39;m not a big fan of &quot;substitute the skill value for the attribute&quot;, because it means that the skill doesn&#39;t really add all that much value to the game. I do have some thoughts on how you could do skills as moves, though.<br /><br /><b>Athletics Training:</b> When you defy physical danger, you always achieve your goal, even on a miss. That doesn&#39;t mean you escape paying a price.<br /><br /><b>Religious Lore:</b> When you spout lore, you may ask the GM to tell you something of import to a faith.<br /><br /><b>Nature Knowledge:</b> When you study the wildlife around you, the GM must honestly tell you if something is amiss with the flora and/or fauna.<br /><br />Or, if you want something more generic, you could use the concept of &quot;advantage&quot;: when you do something in the domain of your skill, roll 3d6 and keep the two highest. Then list two or three descriptors as the domain of a skill. For instance: <b>Athletics (sprinting, jumping, swimming)</b>, <b>Nature Lore (identifying wildlife, foraging)</b>, <b>Diplomacy (saving face, being a suck-up, spin factor)</b>.</p>

        <p>What is the fictional basis for a skill that is not better covered by a move?</p>

        <p>As has been suggested before, you could replace stats with skills. Sort of the way Fate or A Song of Ice and Fire does. So characters wouldn&#39;t have Strength, they&#39;d have Athletics, Brawling, Climbing, etc.<br /><br />The wrinkle there is that you&#39;d need to create moves for <i>every</i> skill available, as every character can attempt the actions related to each skill. You could write a general &quot;Unskilled move&quot;, but as it&#39;s covering a whole bunch of different actions, it would have to be fairly generic.<br /><br />I think it would be hard to find that sweet spot between having too many skills (making the list of moves you&#39;d have to write very long) and having too few skills (meaning each move covers a lot of territory and becomes an ability score again).</p>

        <p>In my Cowboy World WIP there are no classes but 3 attributes (body, head &amp; heart) and a lot of skills, categorized into the three attributes. <br /><br />One move governs all the skills: <b>&quot;When you use a skill while in danger, under fire or when the stakes are high</b> roll+attribute+ skill&quot;<br /><br />It works very well. What is nice is that you could make up a custom skill during character creation or advancement and it works.<br /><br />But it is not DW. It is a different game.</p>

        <p>I too use the skill concept of World of Dungeons. No modifiers, no math, it just alters the fiction of a 6- result.</p>
