messy class idea notes<br /><br />Soul smith<br /><br />Can ghost like summon weapons from his soul<br />You pick a weapon type that you can summon without using a move (advanced moves increase this)<br /><br />You can also create objects but they can only be interacted by living things (so a wall you cant run through it, but an arrow will shoot right through) this requires a move<br />10+ its fine,<br /><br />7-9 pick one *wont last long *you take d4 harm *it hurts others to touch it take d4 harm first time you touch it<br /><br />you always ignore armour and your weapons don’t effect the environment only living things (as you harm their soul) (they leave no visible wounds)<br /><br />you can also heal people via touching their soul<br />advanced moves**<br />• Can read peoples emotions and physical wellbeing on sight<br />• Can sense people in a location without sight<br />• Knockout, you can touch someone and roll<br />10 you knock them out unconscious,<br />7-9 pick one *its drains you take -1 forward, *the target wont be out very long, *it makes them scream loudly before they pass out<br /><br /><br />also im working on a class based on eating magic beans, you have a bag of beans (like ammo) and can find the right bean and eat it for crazy short term effects (become a giant, breathe fire, become water) but with some entertaining downsides

        <p>thanks it obviously needs alot of work, and i did do a few bits more... however i ended up working on my other class and have almost finished the beta version &quot;the bean&quot; a character that eats magic beans and has a table of crazy side effects :D hehe</p>
