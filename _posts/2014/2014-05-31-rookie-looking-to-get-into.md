        <p>I&#39;ve pretty much gotten my Fridays free in the GMT area and really looking to be a player so very interested if its going to be on that day but can maybe do other days.</p>

        <p>I could handle basically every day - preferrably in the evening as I have kids.<br />I suppose we would need one additional person. Maybe I have someone in my close environment who would be interested.<br /><br />The question is, who would be GMing. Although I have watched some &quot;in-game&quot; videos and read the book I have never played myself.</p>

        <p>Most intruiging. And I too might have a +1, so technically we&#39;d already have enough people for a game of powerful ambitions and poor impulse control.</p>

        <p>In theory, *world games should themselves more or less. I could look into it, but I&#39;ll require a little more time to wrap up some other business first.</p>

        <p>OK let me get this straight:<br />As attendees we have: Sebastian Kreis, James Day, Manuel Warum (+1) and me.<br />Volunteering to DM would be Manny and me.<br />I will be on a business trip next week and I&#39;ll try to give the DW book another look. So I propose we should hook up the week after and see who will be DMing.<br /><br />BTW: can we somehow change this conversation into a private one? I suck with G+</p>

        <p>I don&#39;t think you can transfer this conversation per se, but you can always just start a hangout with all the participants.<br /><br /><span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink" href="https://plus.google.com/100866309251483561854" oid="100866309251483561854">David Jatropulus</a></span>, as for the GM part of the book, no need to hurry there. It is explicitly recommended not to do a whole lot of prep for the first session but rather just let things unfold and see which way everything is headed (with a slight emphasis on the &quot;ask questions&quot; part and a very strong emphasis on &quot;the one thing you absolutely canâ€™t bring to the table is a planned storyline or plot&quot;). The proceedings of the first session should dictate how future sessions should go.</p>
