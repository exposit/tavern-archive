Hey everyone, I&#39;ve got a concept for a custom class and am still working my way through the Class Warfare book. Any ideas from veteran content-creators are welcome, as this is my first rodeo. <br /><br />The &quot;Warder&quot; is a warrior archetype that I am building to be a defensive swordsman. Think Geralt of Rivia (Witcher/ Wilzdimin) or Taleon (Shadow of Mordor). <br />In the first draft, I have:<br />D8 damage, <br />10+constitution for HP<br />Load is 10+STR<br /><br />Before I go any further, I am building this class around defensive longsword fighting; pirouettes, parries, and cuts. For the starting move, I am thinking something along the lines of:<br /><br />For the first draft starting moves I have: <br />Armored:<br />Ignore the Clumsy armor tag<br />Iron Gaze: <br />You glare at an upstart individual in a baleful manner. Roll+CHA, on a 7-9, they choose one:<br />-Do what you say<br />-Back away cautiously, then flee<br />-Lay down arms and surrender<br />-Attack you<br />*On a 10+, you also take +1 Forward against them. *On a miss, they do as they please and you take -1 Forward against them.<br />&quot;Vigilant&quot;: Roll+STR to Defend, rather than Roll+CON<br /><del>On a 6</del>, block the attack, but your footing is compromised, granting the next enemy attack +1 Forward<br />-On a 7-9, you are locked with the enemy. No others may assist the combat, enemy or ally. Take +1 Forward<br />-On a 10+, masterfully manipulate the enemy blade, take +2 Forward in combat.<br />-On a 12+, counterattack and deal damage+1d4<br /><br />Still working on Advanced Moves, but they will focus on similar flavors. Any suggestions? Do the Starting Moves seem balanced?

        <p>Vigilant doesn&#39;t work.  You&#39;re not just changing what stat they roll to Defend, you&#39;re changing what what it <i>does</i>. There&#39;s no hold, no &quot;as long as you stand in defense&quot; clause.  Instead, it resolves itself more-or-less instantly.<br /><br />That might be OK, but don&#39;t say it&#39;s &quot;Defend. Come up with a different specific trigger. Like, &quot;when you parry your enemy&#39;s weapon with your own, roll +STR.&quot;<br /><br />Leave the miss result unstated (i.e. GM makes a hard move).  Even if you really want to specify a result on a miss (and you might... if your goal is to make this move more reliable/less dangerous), never say that enemies get +1 forward to attack you.  The GM never rolls, so that sort of thing is meaningless.<br /><br />I&#39;m not sure how Iron Gaze fits into the theme you&#39;ve described.  I&#39;d look at the Blade Dancer moves from Class Warfare instead. </p>

        <p>The idea behind Iron Gaze is a dedicated bodyguard&#39;s ability to strike fear into another through a gaze, as well as giving them a utility ability both in and out of combat. I&#39;ll rework vigilant and put up v1.5 momentarily. </p>

        <p>&quot;Vigilant&quot; 1.5<br />When engaged in melee with one or more enemies, roll+DEX.<br />-On 10+, hold 3<br />-On 7-9, hold 2<br />-On a miss, hold 1, but the enemy has compromised you in some manner. <br /><br />Spend a Hold to perform a maneuver that achieves one of the following results:<br />-Create an advantage. You or an ally may take +1 Forward while exploiting it. <br />- Disengage from melee with one foe.<br />- Throw off the effects of being confused, stunned, or enchanted.<br />- Upon a parry, immediately counterattack 1d4 damage<br /><br />Does that seem a better fit?</p>

        <p>Maybe? What do you want the move to be about? The name &quot;Vigilant&quot; doesn&#39;t seem to match up with the things you spend hold on. And those things don&#39;t seem to be about defense. I suggested the Blade Dancer moves because you described &quot;pirouettes, parties, and cuts.&quot;  But you seem more interested in the defender/bodyguard aspect, so maybe play with that more?<br /><br />Regarding Iron Gaze, maybe the Fighter&#39;s Seeing Red move would be a better model? Possibly with a different trigger (&quot;When some fool is about to start something, roll +CHA...&quot;). As-is, it&#39;s stepping hard on the paladin&#39;s toes and making I am the Law feel less special.</p>

        <p>For a Bodyguard type character with Class Warfare I would start at looking at: <br /><br />Arminger<br />Defender<br />Gorgon</p>
