One of my players is about to take the Monk class with a vow of silence and I CANNOT WAIT to separate him from his allies and have the enemy interrogate him!

        <p>Somebody has a wicked streak. So, how does he roleplay a vow of silence anyway? And I want to see him spout lore, I really do.</p>

        <p>You can make noise and write things out, but speaking sets you back 1 ki.</p>

        <p>I still am not convinced that taking away one of your main tools to role play is a good idea in a roleplaying game.</p>

        <p>The player speaks, and describes how their character communicates.</p>

        <p>Yes. <br />&quot;I wave around and tell him that over there are 3 ogres and an Ankheg&quot; <br /><br />Now you have defeated the whole purpose of having the mute restriction. When a player can only use Charades to communicate everything the game bogs down everytime they want to communicate something. <br />I haven&#39;t seen a satisfying way to do this until now. </p>

        <p>I&#39;m pretty sure we can do better than that. Do what honesty demands, right? Waving hands can&#39;t communicate specifics unless they have a sign language. If their allies aren&#39;t as fluent, they could misunderstand. The monk could spend ki to speak, or get creative. I like the creative solution. I wouldn&#39;t allow that kind of fudging when a character chooses to play a silent character. Not for long, anyway.</p>

        <p>I played a mute pc years ago. I was speaking normally when describing actions, but gesturing for communicating. Sometimes, if precision was needed and we had time in game, I wrote notes.</p>

The other players were collaborating to help communicate, like yes/no questions,  or choices, not requiring elaborate answers.<br />The context was a short arc with a group of players gaming together for years. Also, italians: apart from stereotypes, we really have a great array of standardised non verbal communication tools (I am thinking of at least 4 different come here signs, with different implications), so that could have helped a lot.<br />I would says  it&#39;s worth it if all players and gm are making an effort to make it work, else it&#39;s either pointless (the players talk normally), or feels like having a player not participating.</p>
