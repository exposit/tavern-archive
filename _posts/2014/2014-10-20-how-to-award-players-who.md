How to award players who embrace the downsides of the character they display? Like when a dwarf gets drunken right before an epic fight,  or a kleptomanic thief refuses to flee from a sinking ship full of gold? <br /><br />I need to deal the downsides, that´s the point, but I want to give them some award for being authentic and making a better game. Here are my ideas:<br /><br />1) Fate-Points or alike. I dislike the idea because the usage of those point is in no plausible fictional way related to they earning.<br />2) Gaining XP. I dislike the idea of characters acting stupid just to level.<br />3) A custom move.<br /><br />When you act on your very nature and embrace all the consequences, roll+nothing. On a hit, the immediate result is somewhat under controll. On a 10+, you get to shine.<br /><br />That´s a very vague definition to be polished, but I picture a drunken dwarf with his warhammer stumbling throu the frontlines, beheading orks without even noticing the danger.<br /><br />What do you think? How do you handle that?

        <p>A big part of me thinks players shouldn&#39;t be rewarded for playing their character. After all, this is a <i>role</i> playing game, so rewarding players for playing the game seems kind of dumb. On the other hand, I get why people  do this.<br /><br />Why not just treat it like a Bond? Or one of the three questions for the end of session move? &quot;Did you give into your vice or flaw despite possible danger or consequence?&quot; Yes? Then mark XP.</p>

        <p>I like tossing some XP around when players do something interesting. Really gets em&#39; RP&#39;n</p>

        <p>Christopher, I see why you don´t want to reward Roleplayers to play roles, but I also belive that it´s upon the gamemaster to create incentives for a great game. In this case, I don´t want a strictly mechanical award. I´d prefer the feeling of &quot;That was maybe stupid, but sure it was awesome.&quot;</p>

        <p>Dungeon World is not the right game for that kind of thing I&#39;d say. <br />You could however make it an end of session question: did you show weakness or failure of you character.</p>

        <p>I don&#39;t know if I agree that it&#39;s upon the GM to create incentives for a great game <span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink" href="https://plus.google.com/106939165739784375401" oid="106939165739784375401">Zsolt Sz</a></span>. It certainly isn&#39;t the sole responsibility of the GM. Everyone at the table is responsible for making it a great game.<br /><br />If you don&#39;t want to make it purely mechanical, why not just have awesome stuff happen when players portray their characters&#39; flaws?</p>

        <p>Thanks for the hint to Burning Wheel. <span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink" href="https://plus.google.com/108053817066303198241" oid="108053817066303198241">Christopher Stone-Bush</a></span> , I think that´s a question of definition. The players shall create a great gamer, yes, but it´s the GMs call if he punished or awards great moments. Imagine a GM saying &quot;ok, you are drunken, so you cant fight and will sleep the next 30 minutes&quot;. Letting awesome stuff just happen is the way I think I´ll handle it, but with some random element of the dices. That shall give a balance between reward and foreseeen consequences.</p>

        <p>That would go against <br />&quot;Being a fan of the character&quot; <br />wouldn&#39;t it? </p>

        <p>In my experience, Awesome Points seem to work as well with adults as kids.  When a player could roll or has a chance of success, but instead describes a complication or failure, give them an Awesome Point.  APs can be redeemed for a +1 to any roll after the roll.  Doesn&#39;t matter whose roll it is.  If Bob thinks the most interesting that could happen is for his character to fail or for the situation to get more complicated, he builds a little capital.  Later, when he thinks the most interesting thing that could happen is a success (his or another&#39;s), he can spend as much of his accumulated capital as he likes.  <br /><br />I&#39;ve tried other mechanisms, but I keep coming back to APs.<br /><br />You have to dig through the thread (well worth it anyway) but you can find the source &amp; a nice description of APs in actual play here: <br /><a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/17329/world-of-dungeons-dungeon-girls/p1" class="ot-anchor">http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/17329/world-of-dungeons-dungeon-girls/p1</a><br /></p>

        <p>We use an &quot;MVP&quot; system in each RPG. For the Apocalypse Engine this tends to be a reward of a mulligan or an XP if they don&#39;t spend it during the next session.<br />Our MVP system&#39;s easy, just get the players to write down the name of the most entertaining character and moment, which in our group tends to be screwing up in a character-specific way. This way it&#39;s a reward for being awesome done by committee and reminding people of water cooler moments.</p>

        <p>I have found that making an xp question for end of season rewards their play style you want to feature. If you want to encourage them to rp a weakness, give them a &quot;weakness&quot; or foible and give one xp at end of session for role playing it.<br /><br />If there is no limit to the reward that can be earned, your game will become all about their weaknesses, not their strengths.</p>

If you want to promote play, and you&#39;re dealing with players you can trust, add a question at End of Session that asks if they were faithful to the character. If not, -1 XP. I&#39;m quite the fan of punishing lacking characters rather than awarding &#39;doing an ok job&#39;.</p>

        <p>I do not think punishing players for that is a good idea. Especially because &quot;did you play your character&quot; is hard to pin down without any predefined characterstics you can point to wether they were played or not. Rewarding coherent play - playing like you said you would - is much more fruitful. </p>

        <p>Yeah, I think it definitely needs to be a defined action. &quot;Did you play your Drive&quot; is defined, because a Drive gives criteria. &quot;Did you play your weakness&quot; would be defined because your weakness would have a behavior and risk defined in it.</p>

        <p>While in the shower I remembered that I wrote a move that plays in that territory. It&#39;s from a Compendium Class that makes you go even more wild and anaimalistic as a ranger.<br /><br />ONE WITH THE BEAST<br />When you personally exhibit one of your animal companion&#39;s weaknesses (Flighty, savage, slow, broken, frightening, etc.), hold 1. Later on, spend this hold 1-for-1 to demonstrate one of its strengths (Fast, burly, huge, calm, adaptable, etc.) <br /><br />The original idea for this came from a ApocWorld Driver move that <span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink" href="https://plus.google.com/111694100408744715863" oid="111694100408744715863">J.
