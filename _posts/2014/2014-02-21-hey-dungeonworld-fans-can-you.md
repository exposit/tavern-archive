Hey  <a rel="nofollow" class="ot-hashtag" href="https://plus.google.com/s/%23DungeonWorld/posts">#DungeonWorld</a>  fans, can you help me fine tune a move I&#39;ve been pondering for our next game?<br /><br /> <br />When you agree to trade a memory for an item from the fey peddler, remove 1XP and roll+INT. *On a 10+, you feel like you might have been better off without it anyway. *On a 7-9, you can’t think straight for a bit. Take  minus 1 to your next action. *On a 6 or less, you needed that thought or maybe he dug too deep. Things get dark quickly…

        <p>I get what it represents, but I&#39;m not a fan of the player having to spend an XP as part of the move. I might do something like this:<br /><br /><b>When you barter a memory for an item on the Fey Peddler&#39;s cart,</b> roll + [stat]. On a 10+, he takes only what was offered, and you don&#39;t feel like something is forever missing. On a 7-9, choose one or the other.</p>

        <p>You could have any memory loss reflected in a penalty to Spout Lore. Maybe a -1 Forward to your next Spout Lore. Or -1 Ongoing to Spout Lore, until you roll a 6 -.</p>

        <p>Clarify the move for us... do you want this to be a &quot;high level&quot; move that glosses over the actual negotiations? Or do you want the player and the Fey Peddler to actually go back and forth a bit and negotiate a memory?  (&quot;This fine fiddle? Oh, I&#39;ll give it to you for a song!  What song will you give me?  Oh no, it must be a *better* song that *that* drivel for a fiddle so fine as this!&quot;)<br /><br />If you want to play out the barter, come up with a list of things that they Fey Peddler might want, and rank them in order of value (least to highest) to the peddler.  Make such a list for each PC.  If they agree to the cost, make it matter.  Make it part of the fiction.  But don&#39;t bother with mechanics.<br /><br />If you want it to be high level, where the player doesn&#39;t know what he&#39;s trading, I&#39;d do something like:<br />10+: it was something meaningful but you don&#39;t seem to miss it, much.<br />7-9: it was something recent and somewhat important about one of your friends.  Erase a bond.  You may write a new one to replace it at the end of the *next* session.<br />Miss: it was something big, something important; the GM holds 1. They can spend this hold at any time to reveal an unwelcome truth about your past.</p>

        <p>&quot;Oh this blade? Why yes it is for sale if you are willing to pay the price. No, no, gold is no good to us, don&#39;t insult me or insinuate I would value the stamped yellow rocks that your people do. No, for this a true treasure must be traded. A memory that I can savor and taste for the long seasons of my days. A first kiss perhaps? How about the sound of your mother singing a lullaby when you were a child? Or maybe you would give up the memory of the time you and your father first went fishing together and laughed all summer evening. I can see those, and others, floating there in your mind, glittering in the dark sea of your memory. Sunken treasures waiting to be drawn out... what would you forget?&quot;</p>
