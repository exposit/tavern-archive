What is the most comical, tragic, unexpected or otherwise cool result from a monster&#39;s move you have used?

        <p>I&#39;m playing a PbP game right now.<br /><br />The pcs split up to chase down a guy who murdered their informant. The Druid and Range cornered him on a narrow bridge and disarmed him. I had no idea who the guy was, but I knew I wanted him to represent an evil faction. I asked the Druid player what evil faction opposed the Sultana (and by extension the PCs).<br /><br />The Druid said &quot;blood sorcerers.&quot;<br /><br />Cue a failed defy danger to resist the sorcerer commanding the blood coursing through the Ranger&#39;s body. And a failed assist from the Druid to support the Ranger&#39;s roll.<br /><br />My (surprise) blood-sorcerer just hurled the ranger off the bridge into the river raging below.<br /><br />We&#39;ll see how it goes.</p>

        <p>Well, that&#39;s better than the blood-sorcerer hurling just the Ranget&#39;s <i>blood</i> off the bridge, right? ;)</p>

        <p>PCs were fighting an Anglerbeast, who had the move &quot;swallow someone whole&quot;. It tried to do it to one of the PCs, at which point the fighter, which was defending them, used a hold to halve the effect.<br /><br />I think about it for a moment, consider &#39;say what the rules demand&#39;, and go &quot;Okay, so the cleric is half stuck in the beasts&#39;s mouth, his legs still sticking out. What do you do?&quot;</p>
