Resharing the lich CC, basically because I finally decided on a third move. But man, it&#39;s all over the place.<br /><br />Anyway, the move is inspired by the D&amp;D spell of the same name. And maybe Avada Kedavra, or the Last Word. It may be too strong, though. &gt;.&gt;

        <p>This looks pretty cool, an interesting mix of classic D&amp;D lich and Harry Potter.  I added some thoughts &amp; comments to the document; use or ignore.</p>

        <p>Thanks for the critique! I&#39;ll look into them some more when RL becomes less hectic, but right now I like your suggestions for the PW: K in particular. </p>
