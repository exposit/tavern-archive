Mage-Blight<br />Poison, Dangerous, Touch, 0 weight<br />Often applied to the blades of those who hunt rogue wizards, this alchemical concoction will significantly complicate the casting of the targetâ€™s next spell. Results range from the spell simply fizzling out to the spell going grievously and disastrously wrong. Making this poison is more difficult than making normal poison though, as it requires the base poison to first be created, and then it must be finished by some sort of arcane enchantment. And whoever is making it has yet to be discovered.
