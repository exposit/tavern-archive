Hey gang, I was going to make a big thing based on an adventure my lot have just finished, but half way through I realised spelling everything out kind of goes against DW design; still, have this mess of writings, might be useful to some of you!﻿

        <p>Tony, that is AWESOME!<br />You should publish this, seriously. <br />I would group my cast and dangers somewhat more succinctly,  putting the adventure front portents and doom to establish the big picture first.<br />I would also include some love letters for potential classes to tie them to the situation with the questions you have already asked at the start, but otherwise this is some briny good stuff.</p>

        <p>I haven&#39;t made it through the whole thing, but I do like it quite a bit. Impressive work. </p>

        <p>Hello, been away for a few days. Thank you for the comments guys.<br /><span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink" href="https://plus.google.com/117646243340764868749" oid="117646243340764868749">Nathan Roberts</a></span> Haha, thanks for the support but I&#39;m fine with it being free. Might help someone get started.<br /><br /><span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink" href="https://plus.google.com/105734746085827798569" oid="105734746085827798569">Joshua Slane</a></span> If I was to say I had a favourite bit, it&#39;d be the custom rule for drinking mysterious booze to gain insight and horrors!</p>
