Last time started rough, only one of my six players showed up...

So I pulled from the Twitch audience and ran a pick-up game instead.  Here is what happened:

While on his way to commune with his Spirits, the Dwarf Shaman Cibo ran into his old drinking buddy Tantk, a Human Barbarian from the Sand Wastes to the North.

Drawn to the scent of Pipe & Potables, the Elven Ranger Deamon stumbles upon their indulgent communion and together they decide to investigate the strong scent of rot on the wind.

The not-so-fresh carcass of a Sky-whale they stumble upon becomes the unlikely fixation of Tantk who becomes convinced that somewhere inside that putrid hulk of blubber there is treasure to be found.

But where there is prey there are hunters.  Soon after discovering the crash site our heroes are beset upon by an Airship, her crew of poachers intent on defending their kill.

But there is something amiss.  Why is the forest around the downed sky-whale empty?  What is this great creature doing so far from the Sand Wastes it calls home?

Find out tonight!

Also, if you're interested, I'll be Streaming The Hammers Arc, my live play Edge of the Empire group on Saturday at 5pm PST at: www.twitch.tv/thehammersarc</a>

        <p>Random question: What are/where did you get those icons you&#39;re using to mark the maps? Have just been freehanding Xs on the maps, and those look WAY better.</p>

        <p>Here is the link to the folder of map tokens I&#39;m working on.  I may add more as I need them.  <br />It includes the Illustrator file which you can use to do whatever you want with them: <a href="https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0B7wMo6xswGzmMW5odjJrWk10YTQ&amp;usp=sharing" class="ot-anchor">https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0B7wMo6xswGzmMW5odjJrWk10YTQ&amp;usp=sharing</a></p>
