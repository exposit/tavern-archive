Anyone going to PAX East?  I am! Come see me at the burning wheel booth and I will sign your books, debate weapon tags, explain how spout lore works, talk about CHA vs Charisma. Etc etc. <br /><br />Come say hi!

        <p>I&#39;ll be at the Games on Demand booth quite a bit, which hopefully will be right across from you guys again.  Feel free to send us the people who want to try DW as well.  It was pretty popular at a local con a few weeks ago, when I did the GoD thing there.</p>
