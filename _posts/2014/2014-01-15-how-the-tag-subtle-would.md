How  the tag &quot;subtle&quot; would change a spell? (i&#39;m using the mage playbook)

        <p>You can cast the spell without blowing things up or telegraphing that yes, you are a Mage, and yes you did just cast a spell!</p>

        <p>Or, I guess, depending on the spell, that a spell has indeed been cast. Ok, a fireball is a fireball, but sudden climate change, or finding you particularly likeable... who can tell those are spells?</p>

        <p>You&#39;re not gesticulating, shouting, glowing, thundering or otherwise going &quot;HEY GUYS I&#39;M CASTING A SPELL, PLEASE STAB AND/OR SHOOT ME&quot; through any number of the various tells that go on when someone is casting a spell. There probably isn&#39;t any visible magical trail originating from you, either - your Fireball just involves the target area spontaneously combusting rather than a literal ball of fire shooting out from your hand, for example.</p>

        <p>Is subtle applied to the casting of the spell or the manner in which the spell takes effect?<br /><br />A <b>subtle</b> shift in the wind or change in a mood at the right time can be very useful as well.</p>

        <p><i>Subtle</i>, as an optional tag on Black Magic, means what you want it to. It doesn&#39;t have a canonical interpretation; neither does &quot;debilitating&quot;, for example. <br /><br />Generally it operates relative to the situation - if you don&#39;t want to draw attention or raise an alarm because of the simple fact of your (purely damaging) Black Magic, cast it with the <i>subtle</i> tag.</p>
