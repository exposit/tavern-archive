I&#39;m about to launch a DW campaign using the Innistrad setting from Magic: The Gathering.  The look of the setting is 18th c., and I&#39;d like to introduce black powder weapons (pistols, muskets) to the game.  Has anyone done a write-up of early gunpowder weapons for DW?  It seems pretty straight forward, but I wanted to see what other people had done with the idea (I&#39;d probably go with some new tags like reload, loud, and +1 damage).

        <p>I&#39;d probably just steal tags from AW.</p>

        <p>I haven&#39;t but here are some facts about 18 c. firearms that people don&#39;t seem to realize which could help you:<br /><br />They are super-inaccurate. People weren&#39;t trained to aim their muskets, they were trained to &quot;level&quot; them at the enemy. 50 paces was considered effective range. Note that this is effective range for a 2-deep wall of 600 men to have a chance of hitting another 2-deep wall of 600 men. This is not one man firing at one man.<br /><br />Rate of fire would be slow.<br /><br />So why use them? Damage and ease of use. It&#39;s easier to train someone to use a musket than a longbow. Muskets also do more damage when they hit, often destroying limbs.<br /><br />Hope that helps</p>

        <p>Check out my Pirates! and Bombardier playbooks on RPGNow. There is a bit of fictional disconnect with the Volley move when you &quot;mark off ammo&quot; but thats ok. Most people just live with it.</p>

        <p>Brian Engard worked up a gunslinger. I made it into a pdf for my table.<br /><br /><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B1gbLqXS723cMjNnaGdibThaV2s/edit?usp=sharing" class="ot-anchor">https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B1gbLqXS723cMjNnaGdibThaV2s/edit?usp=sharing</a></p>
