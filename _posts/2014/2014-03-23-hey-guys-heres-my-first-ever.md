Hey guys, here&#39;s my first-ever Base Class for Dungeon World.<br />Can&#39;t wait to have your feedbacks and even if I&#39;m a newbie, don&#39;t pull your punches!<br /><br />A few notes on the character concept: it&#39;s based on a setting I&#39;m developing for something else (a comic book...) that I&#39;ve been dying to play in/test for some time -and DW is perfect for it!<br />I adjusted the original concept for the D&amp;D-inspired fantasy races (dwarves &amp; humans) but know that the Soldier of Law is basically a &quot;desert stormtrooper&quot;, a mix between a Spartan warrior and a primitive Templar-like warrior-with-faith.<br />The Confederate Cities they usually come from are located in a rocky desert basin that generates a tough breed of warriors, DWARF warriors in this version. The humans are basically mercenaries that joined the Army of Law.<br />And yes, they worship the Law as a deity, and are ready to go at length to enforce it. If they ever leave the Army, some find work as &quot;respected&quot; Headsmen in the many courts of the violent province.<br /><br />That&#39;s it!<br />Look forward to hear from you!<br /><br /> <a rel="nofollow" class="ot-hashtag" href="https://plus.google.com/s/%23dungeonworld/posts">#dungeonworld</a>

        <p>Other than a few formatting and grammatical issues (no real reason why there has to be a third page, missing word in Improvised Weaponry, etc), I see two problems with this.<br /><br />1.  The Chaotic alignment&#39;s description is a little vague.  I don&#39;t really understand what I&#39;m supposed to do other than a nebulous &quot;do something harsher than what the Laws say.  Speaking of which, I&#39;ve got no real idea of what these laws are, which is something you could easily tie into a starting move (see: Cleric and Barbarian).<br /><br />2.  Justice is Served could use a bit of a rewrite.  As is, there&#39;s no real reason not to take the first option at any point.  +1 forward AND ignore armor might be a little much, too, but I think that&#39;s just me.  You should probably be looking at effects similar to The Mage&#39;s Cast a Spell move for the 7-9 options instead.</p>

        <p>Thanks <span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink" href="https://plus.google.com/103409142140361430972" oid="103409142140361430972">Ryan Peel</a></span> .<br />Cool suggestions &amp; notes. I will take a look at it like you say.<br />And yeah, I saw the bad formatting right after I posted it. Will re-post it after I write a new draft. (sorry about that)<br />Also please consider this just a &quot;discussion draft&quot;, any typo or other error will be dealt with asap. :P I was in an enthusiastic rush...</p>
