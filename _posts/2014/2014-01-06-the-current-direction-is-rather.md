The current direction is, rather than write up a race move specifically for a class (and potentially limit your race/class choices), we are giving you a list to choose from.<br /><br />Also, like compendium classes you can keep choosing them. With enough race moves it would be easy to just attach hit points and starting gear to a race, and end up with a race-as-class option.<br /><br /> <a rel="nofollow" class="ot-hashtag" href="https://plus.google.com/s/%23dungeonworld/posts">#dungeonworld</a>

Dungeon World was originally intended to evoke the feel of earlier editions of Dungeons & Dragons, which is why when you pick a class you choose a move from one of a few races (and by default paladins can only be human). For me that is not enough, but part of Dungeon World's appeal is its ...

        <p>Not a good idea. Not at all.<br />Yes, it is annoying that there are so many race/class combinations that one cannot possibly cover them all with a move. And the more the game develops, the more &quot;catch up&quot; there will be to do. Yes, this way is simple.<br /><br />Problem? Well... when you base the racial advantage on the class, you can enhance a feature already within that class that is sure to be useful to that class without either negating that class&#39;s disadvantage or giving them something that is extremely potent when combined with something they already get. Moreover, you are more reasonably assured that each option will be reasonably equally valuable to each class while still being different.<br /><br />If you design races separate from classes, there is no parity. Even if you offer 3 options, some combinations are going to end up being massively more powerful when combined some classes than others. A net +1 armor seems basic enough, but means something quite a lot different when armor is damage reduction and one class normally gets a 1 and another usually gets a 3. An additional point of armor on a character who can already have plate armor and a shield is very troublesome.<br /><br />You are inevitably going to come up with options where one race has an option when combined with a class either outright negates the class&#39;s thematic penalty or combines with the features in such a way that it is an outright superior choice to any others. It is a certainty that doing things the easy way will directly result in the game losing one of its best features.</p>

        <p>Definitely some challenges, but I don&#39;t think this is necessarily a bad idea. Balance isn&#39;t as critical in DW as it is made in D&amp;D. And you are treating all the races the same, so there can be useful choices for particular classes as one of the options for every race. I think this is doable if you are careful.</p>

That said, if you are worried about some things stacking too much, you could always give some clauses to the bonus. For example, with the armor bonus, you could say &quot;As long as you are not wearing armor you gain +1 armor&quot; or &quot;You always have a minimum of +1 armor, even when you are not wearing armor.&quot; That would keep the armor from stacking, but still provide some benefit (and would actually stack with some lower armor class abilities that provide armor when you are not wearing armor). </p>

        <p>I posted something pretty similar recently; an example of how I&#39;m handling Pirate World&#39;s races. Each has a PW background, with class moves they can choose, plus equipment and questions for expanding on the world!</p>

        <p>just a few things i realised: <br /><br />Deva: <br />Knowledge: a &quot;free&quot; +1 forward when you need it is kind of powerful. Also you could use this to Spout Lore about Wergoblins to then be better at jumping over a Lavashark. <br /><br />Sun<br />I don&#39;t see the connection to the sun here and it should say 1d4 extra hitpoints. </p>

        <p>i just never really got that connection. <br />Knowledge might work with: &quot;Spout Lore about the problem at hand and act on the information&quot; </p>
