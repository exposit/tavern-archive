<b>Puppet Master Playtest Version</b><br /><br />I was happy enough with this version to give it to one of my friends to playtest. Do you guys have anything to say about it?<br /><br />Any ideas for moves and upgrades would be much appreciated.

        <p>First of all, I like this class. Here&#39;s my thoughts about that:<br />I don&#39;t like this phrase &quot;You’re skilled in ranged combat, but weak in close quarters.&quot;, &#39;cause it seems to say something too much definite about the character. Also, it&#39;s untrue, &#39;cause the class is quite weak in both melee AND ranged combat (no powering up advanced moves, the same chances to hit and the same damage die when you H&amp;S with a rapier, or when you shoot with a crossbow...).<br />RANGED STRINGS: ok, you can string the puppet from the distance. It&#39;s unclear if this move let you use your puppets normally from the distance like Reach or Near range - &#39;cause the base range is Hand Range (written in STRING MARIONETTE move), if I correctly understood the whole thing.<br />CROWD CONTROL, you could put &quot;Requires Multitask&quot;, I feel it appropriate.<br />STRING TO BONE: of course, I feel this as a &quot;broken&quot; move. So let&#39;s say I rolled 10+, now I can control another PC / NPC indefinitely, and I can make him to move and act as my pleasures... Insta-win. Also, &quot;kill yourself&quot; is so easy to command :D I think you should re-think the whole move. Maybe you should impose a roll everytime you issue a command. Maybe with a 7-9 on that roll you gain a debility (still, a little price for a free killing, or a &quot;bring me to the king&quot; etc.), you automatically lose the control and cannot retry on him in the same scene, or you attire attention with the &quot;signs of stress and magical corruption&quot;. Or something better you can come with.<br />DISGUISE, I feel this move isn&#39;t very themed with Puppet Master. Maybe you should re-shape the move to allow the puppet master to create a very realistic looking puppet, allowing it to move in disguise and make some covert missions for you.<br />TOUGH / Iron-Plated puppet augmentation, how does it work? Maybe he would benefit from a custom move (maybe &quot;When the puppet defend, he get always +1 hold, even when he miss&quot;, maybe &quot;ignore the 1st time the puppet is damaged&quot; or something else).<br />Adaptable: what is that &quot;and then some.&quot; ?<br />Sturdy: of course a player could ask you &quot;can I make my puppet carry some equip in my place? How much weight could he carry? How much weight could carry with Sturdy augmentation? Maybe some guide line could be useful.<br />Sundering Limbs: can the head alone move around, enter a small hole, and doing some spying?<br />Extra Limbs / Large: is that d6 d8 a Damage Die? Could be useful to write it down.<br />Lifelike: it&#39;s missing part of the description.<br />Inscribed Rune: Is the triggering an action? Should the Puppet Master to roll some kind of Defy Danger?</p>

I’ll start to make changes right away.<br /><b>RANGED STRINGS:</b> I’ll make it Near. I feel like Close or Reach are too small for this class.<br /><b>STRING TO BONE:</b> Yeah, I can see how it’s broken. I don’t think it can be fixed much, either. I’ll remove it.<br /><b>DISGUISE:</b> There used to be an advanced move called <b>Element of Surprise</b>, which allowed you to create infallible disguises for your puppet. I’ll switch it back.<br /><b>TOUGH / IRON-PLATED:</b> I hoped that the DM would remember these augmentations when dealing damage to it. Should I still make it more substantial?<br /><b>ADAPTABLE:</b> That was just flavor text, but I probably shouldn&#39;t have anything like that in this kind of move.<br /><b>STURDY:</b> Puppets used to have Loads linked to their weight, but giving Loads to objects sounded off to me. Should I add it back in?<br /><b>SUNDERING LIMBS:</b> Sure, you can do some spying if you use Mental Link.<br /><b>EXTRA LIMBS / LARGE:</b> I&#39;ll make that more clear.<br /><b>INSCRIBED RUNE:</b> It’s more of an instantaneous thing. I’ll make that more clear in the description.</p>

        <p>String to bone: I&#39;m sure I could come with something good... I have to think about that... :D<br />Element of Surprise: cool!<br />Tough/IronPlated/Adaptable/Sturdy etc.: maybe (and I say maybe) it could be better to rethink the whole puppet thing. Maybe could be easier to manage them (while apparently more cruncher) with a &quot;full puppet sheet&quot;, including armor, HPs etc. Something like a slightly more detailed wizard&#39;s summoned monster. With a few added details they can become easier to manage in fiction, &#39;cause you use the same rules you are using for characters, monsters etc.</p>

        <p><b>String To Bone:</b> I&#39;d love to hear any ideas you have.<br /><br />I wouldn&#39;t be happy with a change like that, but I&#39;ve been wrong before. I just don&#39;t think that it would help the class&#39; appeal to give the puppet Health or Armor Points. In making this, I hoped to make the puppet feel like a weapon or a tool: Something that could be broken, but not in a quantifiable way.</p>

        <p>About the health issue: maybe you can use an &quot;hybrid&quot; system. You can find inspiration reading the injury system that Pirate World is introducing for his hirelings.<br />In short: you give some boxes (maybe 1 for small puppets, 2 for medium, 3 for large): every time the puppet suffers an &quot;important damage&quot; you check a box (GM states what is an important damage). If you check all the boxes, the puppet is broken.<br />Easy to play, just slightly more detailed. So, you could add a box with Tough / Iron Plated (OR you could leave those tags as narrative only, and the GM knows that he need a bigger damage qualifying as &quot;important damage&quot;). </p>

        <p>Huh. That&#39;s actually a really good idea. I like it! Adding it in right now.</p>

        <p>Also, I had this idea that if you want more Upgrade Points to spend, you can pick from a list of Recurring Defects (Noisy, Frail, Faulty) to get 2 extra Upgrade Points to spend on your puppet. Is that a good idea, or should it be more substantial?</p>

        <p>Aaaaand, this is my 1st take on STRING TO BONE. Please, compare it with wizard&#39;s 7th level spell Dominate:<br />There are dark faces to this art. When you attempt string to a living being,<br />roll+INT. On a 10+, hold 2. On a 7-9, hold 1. Spend one hold to make the target take one of these actions:<br />•  Cancel an action he is going to do, making him wasting some time<br />•  Give you something they hold<br />•  Make an attack on a target of your choice (it uses your base puppet damage; you can borrow his damage OR one of his tags or special ability)<br />•  Walk a few paces in a direction of your choice<br />You can gain +1 holds (even on a 6- result) if you also choose one of these:<br />•  Signs of stress and magical corruption make it obvious that something is wrong.<br />•  You&#39;ll never be able to string this target again.<br />•  You suffer a debility because of the great exhaustion.</p>

        <p>Great! I&#39;ll add it in. &quot;Walk a few paces in a direction of your choice&quot; made me grin devilishly. Maybe &quot;drop something they hold&quot;?</p>
