I&#39;ve now made an ODT version of my Front sheet - it&#39;s not quite worked, but it&#39;s ok. It&#39;s here - <a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/737926/Rob%20Alexander%27s%20DW%20front%20sheet%20v1.odt" class="ot-anchor">https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/737926/Rob%20Alexander%27s%20DW%20front%20sheet%20v1.odt</a><br /><br />Original (Word 2010 format, slightly nicer) --- <a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/737926/Rob%20Alexander%27s%20DW%20front%20sheet%20v1.docx" class="ot-anchor">https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/737926/Rob%20Alexander%27s%20DW%20front%20sheet%20v1.docx</a> ?

        <p>Thanks for this, I was looking for something similar myself and this worked out to be a great tool. If you make any changes let me know.Â <br /><br />The only thing I think is missing is where you could put in some treasures, but I&#39;ve simply added a box.</p>
