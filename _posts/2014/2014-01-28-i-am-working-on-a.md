I am working on a project that&#39;s finally on the fast track thanks to PbtA engine.  Along the way I&#39;m researching whatever I can prior to initiating a Kickstarter.  My question here, especially to <span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink" href="https://plus.google.com/117415966179711277938" oid="117415966179711277938">Sage LaTorra</a></span> and <span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink" href="https://plus.google.com/112484087750169360510" oid="112484087750169360510">Adam Koebel</a></span>, (anyone else with an answer welcome) is who can you recommend as a printer?  I&#39;d like to know who I can rely on and I like the quality of the DW book&#39;s binding.

        <p>DW was printed by Cushing-Malloy. We&#39;ve found their quality exceptional, but customer service can be hit-or-miss.</p>

        <p>Powered by the Apocalypse - the &quot;moves&quot; engine, I guess, from Apocalypse World.</p>

There are other printers that will do digital printing for smaller quantities (and at a higher per/unit cost). <br /><br />Another option is to take advantage of DrivethruRPG to provide print-on-demand copies of your books. The quality won&#39;t be as great as Dungeon World but it&#39;s still quite good.</p>

        <p>That makes sense, and you&#39;re smart to be doing the research now.<br /><br />For what it&#39;s worth, I would suggest not waiting until &quot;the time comes&quot; to start talking about the game. Kickstarter is pretty much a tool that converts social capital into actual capital, so having a sizable group of people who already know and care about your project is a primary part of success. </p>

        <p>I hadn&#39;t really thought about it that way.  It&#39;s not that I&#39;m sitting on it as something &quot;precious,&quot; but it&#39;s still conceptual in a lot of areas.  It is powered by the Apocalypse now, which is was the big sticking point - system.  I knew what I wanted to do, but not &quot;how&quot; to do it, if that makes sense.  I spent years working on a system, revising, completely changing, revising that, etc., and then came DW and eventually the discovery of AW through it, which has given me a system easily hacked for my needs.<br /><br />The game is called &quot;Illuminatus&quot; and deals with the world of secret societies with the added element of cosmic horror.  Characters are agents of the Illuminati, carrying out missions/investigations on behalf of the Order.  I&#39;ll certainly be posting more about it as it materializes further.  Thanks for the advice!</p>
