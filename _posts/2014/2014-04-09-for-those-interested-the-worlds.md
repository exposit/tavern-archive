For those interested, the Worlds in Peril Kickstarter just went live.  It is a Superhero AW hack.  There is an early bird pledge level called Golden Age Hero currently available.

        <p>Got in on early bird as well. I&#39;m definitely interested in the modular playbook system. Although it might be complicated to compile lots of options, I can see this being a very versatile and open source method of providing structure to characters in a flexible and responsive fashion in respect to narrative progression. Kudos. Looking forward to reading more about this one as we go through the campaign.</p>

        <p>There&#39;s a guy who can stop time like the Clockpunk, my favourite character... Cool!</p>
