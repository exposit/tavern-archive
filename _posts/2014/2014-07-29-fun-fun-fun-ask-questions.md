Fun fun fun &#39;Ask questions&#39; part of last night&#39;s game: when they entered into Riyatan, the great trading city at the mouth of the Jeweled River, the noon-time call to prayer was sounding, and the faithful were kneeling to pray.<br /><br />&quot;So, do you guys pray, or what?&quot;<br />Yusuf - &quot;Of course, I&#39;m a good man of the faith.&quot;<br />Gorm - &quot;Nah, this has nothing to do with my gods. I wander around.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Okay, who else <i>isn&#39;t</i> praying?&quot;<br />Yusuf - &quot;The elves. They&#39;re from the mountain forests up north...and they&#39;re dark elves, like Drow. All the elves in this world are &#39;dark&#39;.&quot;<br />Gorm - &quot;They have weird gods. Nobody else understands them.&quot;ï»¿<br /><br />(I should add that Yusuf &amp; Gorm&#39;s players are, respectively, 12 &amp; 10.)
