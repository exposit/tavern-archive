I want to kill you. Come join us for this funnel using the new Dungeon World supplement. Characters are randomly rolled and you&#39;ll likely go through many of them. In the end, whomever lives can likely go on to fame and fortune in another campaign.

        <p>It was one of the stretch goals in a recent kickstarter for the Cinder Queen adventure. It&#39;s called Funnel World and brings the OSR concept of funneling 0 level characters through an adventure.</p>
