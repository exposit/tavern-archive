This is my first attempt in creating a pre-written adventure for dungeon world. It will have a little dark play but this is what I came up with. I wanted to have play that didn&#39;t only consist of the typical dungeon crawl.<br />Reviews and suggestions please.

        <p>Oi! I like it!<br /><br /><br />I&#39;m not sure I like the Druid question, because it brings in another element to the story that isn&#39;t discussed elsewhere. Maybe you could put something subtle in about building over nature or something.<br /><br />Also Sir Tastor is referred to as Tristan in a few places. Or at least I think he is.</p>
