        <p>Mine: the PCs were trying to harness the energy of a sacred grove and got attacked by the dryads who protected it. Fast, feral, teleport-from-tree-to-tree and jump-on-your-back-to-choke-you dryads, not the alluring wood nymph kind.<br /><br />The wizard gets one on his back, choking him, and tries to get her off by slamming her into a tree behind him.  Rolls a miss.  So she drags him into the tree itself, teleporting them into her home tree.<br /><br />That move led to him being trapped inside a tree, getting coerced into become a vessel for the Green.  He agreed and it changed the course of the campaign. </p>

        <p>I played a one-shot where one of the players was a druid that liked to shape-shift a lot (naturally) and consistently botched almost every try. Finally after about the fourth failed attempt in a row I had the Great Earth Spirit appear to him in a vision and demand a sacrifice from him until he proved his worth. On the spot he swore to provide a great service to her in whatever form she thought most appropriate, so for the rest of the game he could only shape-shift into the form of an &quot;Arboreal Mud Squid.&quot; Which surprisingly enough proved to be a fabulously  useful form that he used with great relish.</p>

        <p>Awesome idea! I love things like this that turn the story sideways.<br /><br />I have the feeling this might also be a hard move that changes the course of the game. (Reposting in case people hadn&#39;t seen it before.)<br /><br />The Ranger (who had the God of the Wastes move) tried casting Cure Light Wounds, and failed. I told the paladin who was being healed one thing: &quot;You feel ravenously hungry.&quot;<br /><br />Now I have to sketch out a Front.</p>

        <p>Lots of fictional build up to the power and magical skills of the lich currently presenting himself as a genial old madman at the dinner table. The Cleric decides that she&#39;s had enough, and attempts to Turn Undead. Boxcars. The old man sighs, wishes she hadn&#39;t ruined such a lovely dinner, and then kills the Cleric with a single word.</p>

        <p>The mage surrounded by critters tried a combo of fireball + counterspell to leave unharmed. That was brilliant ! He just superfailed the couterspell and immolated himself (well, killing all critters btw).<br />As it was not the first time he had problems with fire, Death asked him to avoid any kid of fire (natural or not)... forever.</p>

        <p>I have a Druid in my team, and every time he uses Elemental Mastery (he has never rolled a 10+ on it) I start with the elements saying &quot;I have a great idea!&quot; And then they start some sort of cataclysm that, in some way or another, gets the job done (granted with a whole lot of collateral damage).</p>

        <p>Player failed three times in a row. The third resulted in a giant scorpion piercing the ground next to him as he lay on the ground, removing the player&#39;s entire arm. This eventually led to our other PC, a Priest, praying to their deity and his arm was recreated from a mix of fire and scorpion scale.</p>

        <p>Party sent the scout ahead to ease into the town where they suspected the evil captain of the guard and his henchmen were lurking. The scout failed her stealth roll. I declared that the captain and his henchmen had been there, but the party took too long to approach, so the captain had slain the friendly innkeeper who had protected the party, had burnt the inn down to the ground, and then had ridden out of town.</p>
