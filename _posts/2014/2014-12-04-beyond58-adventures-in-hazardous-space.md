Beyond: Adventures in Hazardous Space (sci-fi) - player alpha v1.33<br />+Looking for 1-2 additional playtesters Tuesdays 4pmPST / 7pmEST<br /><br />The Beyond player draft has been improving rapidly.  Underlying content is proving robust, but have clarified wording in several places, reorganized a few parts to make it easier to navigate, and made other tweaks.<br /><br />NB: This is not Dungeon World. This is another Apocalypse World hack that, although heavily inspired by and borrowing ideas from Dungeon World, is designed for a different setting and style of RPG&#39;ing: sci-fi adventures on the edges of known space and beyond.<br /><br />FYI, We are looking for 1-2 more people to join the core playtest.  Gaming is via video Tuesdays 4pm PST / 7pm EST.  If you&#39;re good with providing feedback and would like some sci-fi gaming please get in touch.<br />(p.s. If the class you want to play is missing from the draft, let me know as it may be one of the others I&#39;ve got in the works)<br /><br /> <a rel="nofollow" class="ot-hashtag" href="https://plus.google.com/s/%23scifi/posts">#scifi</a>   <a rel="nofollow" class="ot-hashtag" href="https://plus.google.com/s/%23hack/posts">#hack</a>   <a rel="nofollow" class="ot-hashtag" href="https://plus.google.com/s/%23apocalypseworld/posts">#apocalypseworld</a>

        <p>My group&#39;s Age of Rebellion game has drawn to a close for now, and my Tuesdays are free by default. Color me interested; I&#39;ll have a gander at the book over the next couple or three days.<br /><br />Are you thinking of testing the game for campaign play, or as a series of one-shots?</p>

        <p>Ah, one quick comment before I dip out for the evening: I&#39;m not fond of your secondary attribute being assigned for you by your playbook. There seems to be overlap between the given stat and Expert in several cases, which makes your secondary kind of a dead stat–but more to the point, it restricts the sorts of characters you can make.<br /><br />I find it disappointing that, for instance, I can&#39;t play a reclusive Telepath who&#39;s no good at interacting with people in a normal way, because the playbook says I have to have Vibe+2.</p>

However, we&#39;ll probably restart with the new player(s) so everyone is experiencing (and critiquing) the game right through.<br /><br />You make a good point about the Telepath.<br />  <br />Beyond is not as Attribute driven as other games, because overall characters are more defined by their class and the moves they take.  Secondary attributes could be unhooked from the class, however that opens the door to oddities like the Tough with -1 Handy who still rolls +3 for combat.<br /><br />Either way looks like a compromise. I&#39;d like to find a third option, but right now can&#39;t see how to do that without adding unnecessary complication to the rules. This may be one of those compromises that is better resolved through role playing rather than rules.  Any suggestion welcome :-)</p>

        <p>I feel like the Tough example still works; it just means that they&#39;re no good at physical things that <i>aren&#39;t</i> combat. Makes perfect sense for things like a wimpy sharpshooter, a blind cyber-samurai and the like. The attributes all have multiple applications (two or three universal moves each, or four for Handy), so freeing them up doesn&#39;t <i>seem</i> like it would cause too many problems to me; it just means you&#39;re noticeably better in certain areas than others.<br /><br />And there&#39;s still the dead-stat problem as-is; that +2 Vibe does exactly nothing for the Smooth. Compromises either way as you say, but I think the unhooking would do more good than bad. It&#39;s just theory talk without concrete testing, though. I&#39;m cool with giving it a go as-written before trying something else.<br /><br />Anyway, I see what you mean about attributes mattering less. It seems like you&#39;re pretty much just going to be rolling Expert 90% of the time. I&#39;m not sure I like that, to be perfectly honest, but that&#39;s what playtesting is there to find out.<br /><br />I&#39;m down for campaign play regardless. :)</p>

        <p>Sweet, looking forward to it. Been looking over the book a bit; will try and compile any preplay thoughts I have and shoot them your way.<br /><br />Also, minor question, since you invited us to ask about playbooks. Any plans for a Doctor, or is that just going to fall under the Tinkerer?﻿<br /><br />(Not sure if that&#39;s what I&#39;d want to play, it just seemed a bit conspicuous by its absence)</p>
