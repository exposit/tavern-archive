So let&#39;s say you have a DW character with Dune-style prescience (I just finished Children of Dune). You can see threads of possible futures, which probably means you can force the GM to reveal grim portents and stakes questions, as well as asking your own stakes questions and getting the GM to weigh in on them. Lots of opportunities for making players pony up what they are interested in, etc etc, but hella boring if that&#39;s your only power.<br /><br />What else would you want to be able to do if this was your character?

        <p>Why limit yourself to the prescience? Paul and his kin get all sorts of powers: kungfu, telepathy, the Voice. I can see a move with some horrible trigger like:<br />When you forsee the death of an NPC, roll +wis ...<br /><br />.That alone could be fantastic.</p>

        <p>I once had the idea for a mechanic for inviolable prophecy: if your roll&#39;s success would make the foreseen future impossible, it fails. If your roll&#39;s failure would make the foreseen future impossible, you succeed as if a 7-9, with a harder consequence than normal.<br /><br />(Mostly I agree with J Walton here, though)</p>

        <p>WORSE FATES: If you would die, you may instead receive a vision of some terrible thing that must come to pass first (the GM tells you what), and treat your last breath roll as a 10+. Until that terrible thing either comes to pass or becomes impossible, take -1 ongoing to all rolls.</p>

        <p>-1? For seeing something worse than death? How about you can only form bonds related to it?</p>

        <p>-1 is a pretty big deal! Especially to all rolls. And it&#39;s not necessarily a trivial escape clause, like imagine the GM says &quot;But first before you die, you must see your hometown in flames.&quot; How do you make that impossible?<br /><br />Actually maybe there should be a thing about how the GM  has to add the witnessed terrible thing to the grim portents of a front, or make a front with it as a grim portent right now. Hmmm....</p>

        <p>Its not that -1 isn&#39;t severe - it is! But, you also need to remember it each time, it is static, and we can do better. Making the GM add to the grim portents is a good idea!</p>

        <p>I wrote a clockpunk playbook which is on <a href="http://rpgnow.com" class="ot-anchor">http://rpgnow.com</a>. Seeing the future is difficult in an rpg. (Unless you play pathfinder adventure paths...)<br /><br /> So I limited his prescience to a few moments. It translates into something like jedi reflexes which allows him to reroll dice, have armor based on the fact that he sees a blow before it happens etc. He can also freeze time, jump forward, jump back, see the past, age objects and creatures and rejuvenate objects and creatures. </p>
