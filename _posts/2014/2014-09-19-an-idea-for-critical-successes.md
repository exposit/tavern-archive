Something we have in Apocalypse World but not Dungeon World is advanced versions of our basic moves. The idea is that when you unlock the advanced version of a move you have a chance for ...

        <p>Do we really need advanced moves for 12+?<br />Why not make it default?</p>

        <p>I think that, rather than choosing to advance a whole cluster of moves, I would rather just make a 12+ version of each basic move that is worth it as a standalone.<br /><br />So, make a &quot;Devastating Critical&quot; move that anyone can take that does something on a 12+, similar to the thief&#39;s Evasion.</p>

        <p>If you really really need to have natural 12 matter I would just give players an extra perk on their stuff. So not double damage or ignore all damage or super defy but you just do what you want AND something good/cool happens. The opposite of a hard move, a hard move against the opposition. Decided by the GM.</p>

        <p>I was just copying the mechanic from Apocalypse World, hence why you advance 1/2 the moves at a time, though the idea of a supercrit for just one move sounds intriguing. </p>

        <p>I like these.  It is something that has come up.  In another discussion I said I already do something cool on a natural 12 (and twist the knife on a 2).  I think this is good if your players want a mechanical advantage for the 12+.  I think the balance for the advancement slot is about right, but I like the idea of stronger ones that you have to take 1 at a time as well.  That would make for more specialized characters.</p>

        <p>Each of these is pretty strong on its own, and some of them tread pretty closely to existing advanced moves. If I were going to do this, I&#39;d go with David&#39;s idea and make a single Advanced version of each basic move, universally available at levels 6-10. <br /><br />But I don&#39;t think I&#39;d ever do this with the existing structure of classes. Too much potential for stepping on niches.</p>

        <p>I... don&#39;t really think this achieves anything.   It&#39;s an &quot;I am used to games that are all about the mechanics, so it doesn&#39;t feel right that the numbers don&#39;t get bigger when I roll boxcars&quot; kind of patch that doesn&#39;t really seem in line with Dungeon World&#39;s philosophy at all.<br /><br />Most of these changes add nothing except &#39;You do a little more damage&#39;  - and I&#39;m not sure Advance Parley works at all, since you still need to have Leverage to initiate the move.   The only one that I think is really cool is Advanced Spout Lore, and honestly, I&#39;d rather just tug that concept back so that they don&#39;t need to roll 12+ to do it.</p>
