Just wanted to let folks know that my DW hack <i>No Country For Old Kobolds</i> has gone through significant updates thanks to play testing at Origins and with my local groups. I&#39;m at a stage where I want to open it up for play testing by others to illicit feedback. So if your group is in the mood for some black comedy about kobolds and the terrible lives they are forced to lead thanks to the constant pressures of murderhobos and surrounding kingdoms that want them dead give it a shot and let me know how it goes!<br /><br /><a href="https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0B3bDRz-B9Fj7VG1wYkpJcmhTcUk&amp;usp=drive_web" class="ot-anchor">https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0B3bDRz-B9Fj7VG1wYkpJcmhTcUk&amp;usp=drive_web</a>

        <p>The intro is making me sad for Kobolds... but at the same time makes me want to play it for the same reason. Thanks for sharing!</p>
