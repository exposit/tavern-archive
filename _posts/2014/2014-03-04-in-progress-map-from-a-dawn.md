In-progress map from a Dawn of Worlds setting-building session this evening. We&#39;ll be finishing up with this and hopefully starting in on Dungeon World proper (for a given definition of &quot;proper,&quot; as you shall see) next week.<br /><br />We haven&#39;t gotten into the real meat of civ and city relations, but we do have a pretty solid roster of races and other fun setting features, including...<br /><br />The blood elementals, natives of the sanguine forest and oldest of the sapient races. Masters of alchemy and devotees of Kael, god of despair.<br /><br />The northern dwarves, pure-hearted and hard-working folk who are expanding across the northern tundra in the name of their god Crom.<br /><br />The yetis, chosen of the Living Aurora and masters of sorcery, in a tense alliance with the much more numerous dwarves who dwell to the east.<br /><br />The Kalroom, towering scaled followers of Setesh, the First Dragon, who dreamed in rain long before any other mind dared to awaken. From their rain-drenched and insular homeland, they raise their fleet of skyships, watching the world below with unknown purpose.<br /><br />The winged elves, first of the elven races, who were born and make their home atop a flying mountain, in the cloistered city of Ahlmelle, as their land-bound cousins watch from below with twisted and jealous hearts. The watchful guarding gaze of Anosael, the southern dragon, protects them for now...<br /><br />The Narelves, students of Ithilwen, the great dragon of the inland sea, who control most trade on the continent from their riverside city of Tratturis Keep.<br /><br />The Giratibilu, tauric scorpion nomads who roam the southwest desert. Little is known of them, save that they are more honorable than insectile prejudice might suggest.<br /><br />The humans who people the southeast corner of the continent, still shaking off a long history of exploitation and split between a culture of city-dwellers and hill-dwelling nomads.<br /><br />And finally, terrorizing the coastline from their capital of Kalesh in the southeastern archipelago, the fearsome gorillas, masters of the sea and cunning inventors.<br /><br />Thus far, it is <i>just</i> the right blend of crazy awesome and fantastic that I was hoping for. It is largely up to me to make sure it stays that way, but from what I&#39;ve seen so far my mindset and that of the players seem to mesh pretty darned well in that front. :)<br /><br />Also, &quot;Lizardfolk Seattle with zeppelins&quot; is possibly the best description of a fantasy city I&#39;ve run across!<br /><br />...With &quot;Teslapunk slaver gorillas&quot; being possibly the best description of a fantasy <i>civilization</i> I&#39;ve come across.<br /><br />To say that I am looking forward to the campaign would be something of an understatement. :D

We'll be finishing up with this and hopefully starting in on Dungeon World proper (for a given definition of "proper," as you shall see) next week.

We haven't gotten into the real meat of civ and city relations, but we do have a pretty solid roster of races and other fun setting features, including...

The blood elementals, natives of the sanguine forest and oldest of the sapient races. Masters of alchemy and devotees of Kael, god of despair.

The northern dwarves, pure-hearted and hard-working folk who are expanding across the northern tundra in the name of their god Crom.

The yetis, chosen of the Living Aurora and masters of sorcery, in a tense alliance with the much more numerous dwarves who dwell to the east.

The Kalroom, towering scaled followers of Setesh, the First Dragon, who dreamed in rain long before any other mind dared to awaken. From their rain-drenched and insular homeland, they raise their fleet of skyships, watching the world below with unknown purpose.

The winged elves, first of the elven races, who were born and make their home atop a flying mountain, in the cloistered city of Ahlmelle, as their land-bound cousins watch from below with twisted and jealous hearts. The watchful guarding gaze of Anosael, the southern dragon, protects them for now...

The Narelves, students of Ithilwen, the great dragon of the inland sea, who control most trade on the continent from their riverside city of Tratturis Keep.

The Giratibilu, tauric scorpion nomads who roam the southwest desert. Little is known of them, save that they are more honorable than insectile prejudice might suggest.

The humans who people the southeast corner of the continent, still shaking off a long history of exploitation and split between a culture of city-dwellers and hill-dwelling nomads.

And finally, terrorizing the coastline from their capital of Kalesh in the southeastern archipelago, the fearsome gorillas, masters of the sea and cunning inventors.

Thus far, it is just the right blend of crazy awesome and fantastic that I was hoping for. It is largely up to me to make sure it stays that way, but from what I've seen so far my mindset and that of the players seem to mesh pretty darned well in that front. :)

Also, "Lizardfolk Seattle with zeppelins" is possibly the best description of a fantasy city I've run across!

...With "Teslapunk slaver gorillas" being possibly the best description of a fantasy civilization I've come across.

To say that I am looking forward to the campaign would be something of an understatement. :D</a>
