My groups bard is looking to multiclass to add something beyond social and knowledge skills to her repertoire. Anyone have a favorite multiclass move they like to take for a bard? The other party members are a druid and a wizard, so any of those moves are out.

        <p>Some thief moves or an Animal Companion with the &quot;perform&quot; training would be good. A little ferret or even a dancing bear. I&#39;d talk with the player about adding it&#39;s cunning (or ferocity but that&#39;s less &quot;Bard-y&quot;, IMHO) to some bard moves if the fiction is appropriate.</p>

        <p>Given the group you&#39;re running, it&#39;s not unfair to let her pick up something that would normally be considered a &#39;niche&#39; move from another class:<br /><br />* Give her a quest for a sword thought long lost to legend (Fighter&#39;s Signature Weapon)<br />* Train her in the gentle art of &#39;working a crowd&#39; with a gang of urchins (Thief&#39;s Tricks Of The Trade)<br />* Not content with telling the tales of other heroes, she has learned how to put /herself/ into the stories, to great and magical effect (Paladin&#39;s Quest)</p>

        <p>I was looking at the Grim World Classes, and I think Gambits move from the Battlemaster class would suit this character very well. She&#39;s very much into setting traps and making plans.</p>

        <p>maybe the custom weapon from figher? a really elegant gifted weapon?</p>

        <p>Anything from inverse world or grim world could fit. Especially the battlemaster if she has high INT. Otherwise, if she wants to be a better warrior, she could pick the ranger&#39;s dual wielding moves. What&#39;s cooler than fencing with a rapier? Fencing with two rapiers, of course!</p>

        <p>Immolator has some great moves for a bard to multiclass dabble in, like &quot;Moth to the Flame&quot; and &quot;Firebrand.&quot;</p>

        <p>Thematically a bard with a well trained pet makes sense.<br />This could go any which way, I&#39;d even just let them make up a custom move because why not?</p>

        <p>My Bard looked at the Princess playbook, and now kind of wants the Unicorn move</p>

        <p>Man, who wouldn&#39;t want a unicorn.<br /><br />What?</p>

        <p>The move just says you have a unicorn, and you can pick a temperament, build and color. And then it can do whatever unicorns can do I imagine. Baller move.</p>
