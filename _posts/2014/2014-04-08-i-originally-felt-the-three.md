I originally felt the three end-of-session questions were a little weak - a ritual we went through that didn&#39;t achieve much.<br /><br />&quot;• Did we learn something new and important about the world?<br />• Did we overcome a notable monster or enemy?<br />• Did we loot a memorable treasure?&quot;<br /><br />Then I realised two things:<br /><br />1) Every &quot;yes&quot; is 1 XP per player; with 3 players, that&#39;s worth three alignment hits or three 6- rolls<br /><br />2) The XP are secondary, anyway - the main benefit is the implicit meta-question: &quot;Did exciting fantasy adventure go down this session?&quot;

        <p>Yeah, those three questions basically say &quot;this is what DW is about.&quot;  They serve as a good reminder to everyone involved: make these things happen.<br /><br />Example: Last session, as we started wrapping up I thought about the questions, I realized that we&#39;d gone a couple sessions without looting memorable treasure. So I quick thought of something to include (the heartwood of a treant they&#39;d just killed). <br /><br />Now I&#39;ve got a new story element to work with and the players get a new toy.  Win-win.</p>

        <p>Wait a second, what does the number of players has to do with the amount of XP gained per player? The manual says:<br />&quot;Then answer these three questions <b>as a group</b>&quot;. It&#39;s the whole group that answers them so every player can potentially gain up to 3 XP. At least that&#39;s how I see it ...</p>

Although it&#39;s more the mundane treasure (coin) that I&#39;m struggling with - I&#39;m not use to games that track wealth in this detail, so I&#39;m not used to seeding it.</p>

        <p>You can use the loot table a lot of the times. Also players are responsible for looking for treasure and going places where it is. </p>

        <p>Yeah show there is a random glint of treasure in any of your dungeons/places of adventure and the adventures will go for it!</p>

        <p>When I&#39;ve remembered to use it, I&#39;ve found the loot table to be remarkably liberating and inspiring. <br /><br />Liberating because it gives me permission to dole out a new spell or a magic item or a big treasure reward without worrying about it &quot;breaking the game.&quot; <br /><br />Inspiring the way any good random table inspires (&quot;Huh, why would there be everything they need for a new spell in the lair of a giant squid maggot? Well, I guess it could be...&quot;).</p>
