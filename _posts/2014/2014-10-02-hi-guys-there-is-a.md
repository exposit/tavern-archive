Hi guys, there is a new hobby store in town, (the only hobby store) and the owner interviewed me about roleplaying games and he asked &quot;what do people need to start playing roleplaying games?&quot;<br />My first jump answer was &quot;dice&quot; but I think now that a Starter Dungeon World Set would be awesome to be sold to promote the game in new people to roleplaying games. I want to create it. Fast rules in easy reference cards, characters in short ready to play the first mini adventure and if they like it prompt them to buy the book and read the whole thing. Do you have any advise on this idea?

        <p>Part of Pirate World (that is so damn close to release now!) is a mini-expansion caled Luncheon World; mini-playbooks, short adventures and pick up and play rules that are even faster :D I&#39;ll definitely be releasing it separately. The mini-playbooks are Pirate World&#39;s classes, but it&#39;d be cool to do it with the basic DW classes instead. I&#39;d love to see what you do with this, especially the reference cards.</p>
