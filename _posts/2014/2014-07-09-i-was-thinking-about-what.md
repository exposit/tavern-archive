I was thinking about what a Dwarven Druid might look like. <br />I don&#39;t think a new racial power covers it - a dwarf&#39;s nature is to harvest and refine.  It stands in contrast to the Druid&#39;s desire to live in protection of a natural cycle that, in part through them, is self sustaining.  A world full of nothing but Dwarves would end up looking like the clockwork planes eventually.<br />Enter The Rock.  The Rock protects the rich earth while simultaneously exploiting her.  A Druid serves within nature, but The Rock &#39;corrupts&#39; her into a form more pleasurable to those with sentience.<br /><br /><a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/juf3sfjzohm9mqk/TheRock.pdf" class="ot-anchor">https://www.dropbox.com/s/juf3sfjzohm9mqk/TheRock.pdf</a>

        <p>Small suggestion, instead of only having one choice for race, have backgrounds, like tinkerer, miner, etc</p>

        <p>Thanks for the suggestion!  I&#39;ll mull it over. <br />I don&#39;t disapprove of alternatives to the race selection, but... when I saw Paladins could only be Human it said a lot to me about the class, about the nature of the society where it could exist - warlike, depraved, holy, narcissistic and altruistic.  I think there&#39;s a message in showing that it is limited to Dwarves that wouldn&#39;t be as apparent if I limited it to Dwarves but gave background options.<br />In likelyhood I&#39;ll keep it as one &#39;option&#39; for my stack-of-classes and add a few alternate options as they come to me for an alternate take for other people and groups.</p>

I think that with the classes like druids could welcome any race with the right fiction, a dwarf might be the protector to a druid until he/she moves on then the protector inherits the role or could be a wilder tribal family where the shaman/druid replaces the priest for these dwarves.</p>

        <p>I&#39;ll concede that a dwarf could be The Druid, formerly a protector of and trained slash indoctrinated by a magical hippie (aka druid, lower-case-d).  Or using The Druid as a substitute for a Shaman class - Druids focused on the ability to inflict harm to cure others and speak with an area&#39;s resident spirits fit the bill nicely. <br /><br />It felt like the Dwarfs needed their own distinct class that embodies the feel of the Druid but without the desire for balance.  A nature mage, a cultural outsider, the loner, clothed and fed by the land, enemy of those who would damage their sacred lands.  I (semi-subconsciously) consider Druids as forest folk.  Dwarves are mountain-folk (at least in most of my games) and their avatars-of-nature should reflect that.  I want The Rock to carry that distinction further than can be done with the core-class Druid.</p>

        <p>Choosing the race option of the playbook simply gives you the racial &#39;power&#39;. Want a dwarf druid (shapechanger), just say you&#39;re a dwarf, you just don&#39;t get the halfling / elf / human racial power. If you like you could take the approach from the Planarch codex and choose a heritage move instead.<br /><br />That&#39;s the way we play, and like with all things DW, the choices the players make shape your gaming group&#39;s particular vision of DW.<br /><br />That said, your vision of a dwarvish druid as a seperate class is kinda cool.</p>
