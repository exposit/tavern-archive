Merry Christmas Dungeon Worlders! I hope the Krampus didn&#39;t come and take anyone you know away to boil them in oil! Its good to know that we survived another season of zombie snowmen also. Viking Santa wasn&#39;t having any of their shit!<br /><br />Just out of curiosity, has anyone ever encountered any playbooks for Diablo classes? I could just make them myself, but if any work has been done by others I&#39;d be interested to see it.

        <p>No Diablo playbooks that I know of but you&#39;ll want to check out <i>Poor Tristram</i> if you haven&#39;t already.</p>

        <p>You know, I was thinking that Borderlands classes would translate well to Dungeon World because they all have three power trees. I&#39;ll bet the same logic applies to Diablo classes too. Although a lot of the Diablo skills are more like alternatives than synergies, from what I recall of II.</p>
