Would you mind sharing whatever you like about the game you mentioned here?: <a href="https://plus.google.com/u/0/109642651284569232843/posts/jcGxSfMEWt9" class="ot-anchor">https://plus.google.com/u/0/109642651284569232843/posts/jcGxSfMEWt9</a>

        <p>Mostly we just reflavored and reskinned existing race moves. We generally don&#39;t hold on to the whole &quot;Only elves can do XYZ&quot;. We like to go with the way Grim World does race. You just pick what you want and say &quot;I&#39;m a Charr&quot; or whatever you want to be. I&#39;ll start looking for the actual custom things we built, but I might not get to it till after this weekend.</p>
