Hi guys<br /><br />I just wanted to let you all know that my Harry Potter inspired class:&quot;The Duelling Wizard and the Highly Derivative Playbook&quot; will be out within the week on RPG Drivethru for free, through Street Rat Games. It&#39;s a replacement for the default Wizard class and includes broom riding and familiars among other things. Also, awesome offensive spellcasting and wand mechanics sourced from the books, movies and videogames. It&#39;s been extensively playtested and is thoroughly challenging at low levels and badass on high levels. The advanced moves are fresh to death. &#39;Sall good. <br /><br />I&#39;ll post the link on this thread as soon as it&#39;s out :)
