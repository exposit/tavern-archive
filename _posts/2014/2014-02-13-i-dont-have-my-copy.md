        <p>Choose a bunch (3-6) of appropriate dangers for the dungeon, and give them a countdown (3 - 6). Each time the players enter a room, either roll a dice of just choose how strong that danger is thematically. For a dice roll, just do the usual 2d6: 6- means not present, 7-9 means +1 strength, 10-11 means +2 strength and 12+ means +3 strength. Mark off the number of check boxes equal to its strength. Once all checkboxes are marked, that danger is exhausted from the dungeon.</p>

        <p>Thanks a lot Michael. In the end I did something simpler, but I&#39;ll have a look at it again tomorrow and decide what&#39;s best for the game.</p>
