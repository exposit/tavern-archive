New Wizard Move (with inspiration from Backstab and Called Shot):<br /><br />Use Arcane Device<br />When you activate an arcane device that you&#39;ve identified, it just works for you.  If the device has Charges, you may expend 1 Charge and roll +INT.  On a 10+, the device works, and choose 2.  On a 7-9, the device works, and choose 1. <br />* The device immediately regains the Charge you spent.<br />* The effects are maximized.<br />* It affects an additional target of your choice.<br />* You deal the device&#39;s Arcane Power<br />* You avoid notice or retribution for the activation<br /><br />A device would look something like this, where it has a standard effect and an additional Arcane Power effect, accessible only to Wizards who expend Charge:<br /><br />Wand of Disintegrate<br />b[1d10] damage<br />2 Piercing, Far, Requires: Thief, Wizard<br />* Arcane Power: Reduce the target&#39;s armor by 2 until they repair it.<br /><br />Wand of Fireball<br />b[1d8] damage<br />Near, Area, Requires: Thief, Wizard<br />* Arcane Power: Set the ground ablaze<br /><br />Your thoughts?  This would definitely tend to push most devices towards having some kind of Charges.

        <p>It makes for dull magic items. No different from spells.<br /><br />&quot;Wand of Disintegrate. A thorny, twisted double spiral of black metals, warm to the touch. Point the wand at a thing. Poof! It&#39;s gone. Better hope you don&#39;t miss.&quot;</p>

        <p>Hmm, good point!  I&#39;m used to games where many wands do simply serve to recreate a spell without relying on the spellcast, but that&#39;s not the OSR way for sure.  I&#39;ll have to think about more interesting items.</p>

        <p>Adrian Brooks has a good point.<br /> How about using them as a sort of specialized focus? Like using a specific wand changes the spell in some way, and indeed if you aren&#39;t careful who&#39;s to say were the arcana will flow. </p>

        <p>I&#39;d say there&#39;s nothing wrong with wands being no different from spells. But I like <span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink" href="https://plus.google.com/107187741224017958593" oid="107187741224017958593">Kasey Cranfill</a></span>&#39;s idea as well. Although I think it could be extended in such a way that the wand seems to have a will on its own, similar to the one ring in Lord of the Rings or Stormbringer in the Elric of Melniboné saga.<br /><br />Maybe one could peek at how Fetishes work in Werewolf: The Forsaken: &quot;Remember,  fetishes  are  not  simply  “magic items”.  They  possess  a  spirit  within them – and that spirit has its own goals, personality, and may affect how well the fetish performs.&quot; (description shamelessly borrowed from one of the Camarilla manuals)<br /><br />This <b>could</b> only affect the narrative side of the move (no maximized effect? -&gt; spirit is unsure/upset about what you are doing, but will go along for now; 1-6 roll? -&gt; spirit is unhappy about what you are doing and refuses to do anything; etc); though I could also see this encoded manually, but that would probably make more sense on an item-per-item basis. On the upside, the item-per-item basis would make it not just A wand of something, but THE wand that hosts the Mischievous Kindling Spirit of the Burning Forest [tm].<br /><br />PS: I am sorry if I derailed the topic slightly by rambling on about Fetishes and Werewolf: The Forsaken.<br /><br />PPS: I can, however, elaborate more on the subject of Fetishes and Spirits in the context of Werewolf and/or the World of Darkness, if that is of interest to someone who doesn&#39;t have the books around.</p>
