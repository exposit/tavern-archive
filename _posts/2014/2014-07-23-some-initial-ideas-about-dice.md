Some initial ideas about dice rolling, aspects and attributes in my combination Fate/Dungeon World hack,

As part of my attempt to create a game combining elements of my two favourite systems (Fate & Dungeon World) I start collecting together some of the rules that I intend to use in the game.    * * *      Dice Rolling     I hav...

        <p>How are you going about health? Fate, AW, DW? What about experience or ways to advance?</p>

        <p>I&#39;m currently planning to use the DW methods of handling HP and XP.</p>

        <p>Please don&#39;t! I much prefer AW way of doing both. More than that, I prefer what AW: Dark Ages is doing.</p>

        <p>I can&#39;t claim to have played AW so its unlikely I&#39;ll be using the mechanics from that I&#39;m afraid, I&#39;m currently looking at trying to put together a system combining DW HP with Fate Consequences.</p>

        <p>I would recommend looking at it. Health and XP is quite similar to dnd and that is why I like the other better.</p>

        <p>Very Interesting. I am toying with a hack too atm, but am thinking more in the line of handling aspects like attributes (as seen in Pdq) i.e. Giving them modifiers.<br />And yeah, hp from Dungeonworld woulnt fit i think, since they are too dnd specific - a more generic harm move like AW has may do the trick, for it has to be flexible/ adaptable enough to handle different levels from gritty to heroic, whatever befits the setting.</p>

        <p>I&#39;m planning to have a look at the system used in AW world, although I can&#39;t say I agree with HP being D&amp;D specific since the idea of a pool of health points is used in numerous different RPGs.</p>

        <p>I&#39;m pretty sure that a flat 1d12 completely changes the game. Is that what you&#39;re going for?</p>

        <p>Whilst a 1d12 roll changes the probability I think its an exaggeration to say it completely changes the game, but should it prove to be too unbalancing during playtest then i may change it.</p>

        <p>Yeah, give it a go. Can&#39;t find it, but saw a really good article discussing the probability curve of 2d6 and how *world games are built around the 7-9 result. That&#39;s why I think a single roll will really change the fundamental nature of the game.</p>
