Hi folks, <br /><br />I&#39;m looking for feedback on these class moves. I wrote them a few years ago, before DW was publicly released, and then revised them a couple of years back when DW was released as CC BY. <br /><br />Now that Grim Portents will be publishing regular content as a blog, I wanted to clean them up, polish them off and put them on the blog.<br /><br />Because they&#39;ve already been shared in a few different forms over a few years, I&#39;m not precious about them. Feel free to be brutal: &quot;Delete Detect Chaos, it&#39;s a waste of space&quot;; &quot;Wellness is weaksauce&quot;, etc. If the result is that only half or a third of them make the grade, that&#39;s not a problem to me. <br /><br />Thanks

        <p>Wellness is indeed weaksauce. ^^ ﻿<br />Iron Mind needs to be cleaned up.</p>

        <p>Blindsight - you can do that already with DR<br />Death attack: can you explain how that works?</p>

        <p>Hey <span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink" href="https://plus.google.com/110330901807759406775" oid="110330901807759406775">Tim Franzke</a></span>, thanks for your feedback. With Death Attack, the idea is that you can backstab them once to set up a weakness, and then backstab them again for a guaranteed kill. I should specify that the enemy that you&#39;re sizing up has to be the one that you&#39;re attacking.</p>

        <p>At level 6, would you need 2 attacks to kill them or shouldn&#39;t the first backstab be enough? </p>

        <p>Hmmm, good question. What if you could select setting up a weakness and taking advantage of the weakness in the same backstab? Then, on a 10+ you kill them immediately; on a 7-9 you can set up the kill for the next backstab.<br /><br />Or what if the setting up a weakness was a rider on every attack, like this:<br /><br />When you hit a creature, you have it in your sights. When you backstab a creature in your sights and roll 7+, you kill it.</p>
