Looking forward to starting my Darksun Dungeonworld game this Saturday evening, i&#39;ve got the various Darksun playbooks that are available and source material; wondering if anyone had any advice for the first session?

        <p>First and foremost, ask questions and build on the answers.</p>

        <p>Ask ques... ok, you got that. <br />The other two most important things are:<br />-Play to see what happens, let yourself to be surprised by the game. <br />- Draw maps, leave blanks, let yourself be surprised by the setting.</p>

        <p>Here you can find my techniques for the first session: <a href="https://plus.google.com/u/0/+EzioMelega/posts/iyXhNiQC56c" class="ot-anchor">https://plus.google.com/u/0/+EzioMelega/posts/iyXhNiQC56c</a><br /><br />Since you are using a known setting you will have less freedom of creating, but they steel can be applied: play in the voids, fill them with awesome, change the world and the setting.<br />Always remember: if the players (and you are aplayer, too) contrast with the written setting... you have the precedence.</p>

        <p>I started working on some Dark Sun races for Dungeon World. As with all my game projects, I never finished. I&#39;ll be interested in hearing how things go.</p>

        <p>Just know the world well enough as well as special universal rules like psionic abilities, water importance, etc.</p>

        <p>Hmmm... I honestly think this comment is a little unproductive. Or, at least, I&#39;ve misunderstood.<br /><br />Let me explain: knowing the setting as it is written in the old sourcebooks isn&#39;t terribly relevant. If you aim to be surprised, to play in the shadow zone of the defined setting so to be able to change things, to insert your own fantasies and desires in it you don&#39;t need, for example, to know what&#39;s happening at the other side of the continent.<br /><br />It will be more important to know what the players <i>want</i> out of Darksun. If you have decided to play &quot;in Darksun&quot; it&#39;s because some of that setting calls to you.<br />I suggest you to find out what&#39;s that. Ask everyone to write down one or two things they really, really, REALLY love about Darksun, the things that made them say: let&#39;s play Darksun!<br />Psionic, sea of mud, lack of resources, those things, then made what you have written down central to your campaign and scratch the rest as not important.</p>
