Not that my players would ever disagree, but I&#39;m curious: player moves are written with a very NPC facing tone; how would you handle PC vs PC activities?

        <p>I have both roll. Then I take the acting PC&#39;s roll + 7 - the defending PC&#39;s roll. It&#39;s a bit math-y, but the results should generally be in the right zone. They can get much higher or lower than a regular roll, but those just fall into the fail and full success zones anyway. It&#39;s the mid-range that counts.</p>

        <p>It&#39;s the main problem in dw. It&#39;s not a pc vs pc system. I usually use the help/hinder rule.</p>

        <p>&quot;What do you do?&quot;<br />followed by<br />&quot;How do you respond?&quot;<br /><br />For direct violence, if one tries to disengage and has a realistic ability to do so it ends in a stalemate.  And as the GM you&#39;ll get a Hard Move sooner or later you can use to introduce a complication that will likely draw them back together.  Try to come up with something they could EASILY handle together, but that&#39;ll be a trial without them.<br /><br />If they&#39;re going blow-for-blow on each other, I&#39;d keep asking for (usually alternating) H&amp;S and Defy Danger rolls.  The first miss falls <b>HARD</b> though.  The missing player ends up on his butt in a corner, either unconscious or with the other player&#39;s sword to their throat.  Or one tackles the other THROUGH a wall, they fall a story into the dark alley next door and get set upon by opportunistic thieves.<br /><br />In future I think I&#39;m going to steal the Dark Age Apocalypse World mechanic for Single Combat.  Keep an eye on <a href="http://lumpley.com" class="ot-anchor">lumpley.com</a> - it&#39;s going through playtesting now and looks pretty awesome.<br /><br />If it&#39;s non-violent I&#39;m a fan of notes midsession, minimum die rolling, and asking them to spell out their machinations between sessions through email or talking before/after the game.  It can take a while to convince traditional roleplayers that you aren&#39;t asking for their plans to set up ways to screw them over. <br /><br /><br />I had just two examples of PC vs PC conflict.  The first involved a demon-hunter discovering that one of the party was secretly a Tiefling.  The Tiefling was a swordmage though, who had a <b>blink</b> ability to jump through space.  And she knew she couldn&#39;t take the demon hunter in a fight, so she just stayed WAAAAY out of his way for a session and a half. </p>

        <p>Don&#39;t forget there is an interfere move.<br /><br />When you help or hinder someone you have a bond with, roll+Bond with them.<br /><br />On a 10+ they take +1 or -2, your choice. On a 7–9 you also expose yourself to danger, retribution, or cost.<br /><br />Someone comes at you with Hack and Slash you roll Interfere.</p>

        <p>I&#39;m with Delos.  Whoever declares action first gets to roll and the victim gets to interfere.  After that I ask the victim &quot;what do you do&quot; and the cycle continues till a fail gives me a chance to give them bigger problems.</p>
