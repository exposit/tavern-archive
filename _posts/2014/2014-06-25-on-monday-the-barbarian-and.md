On Monday, the Barbarian and the Fighter slew the Orc Warchief escaping only with the Iron Sword of Ages and their lives (well, one of them anyway).<br />I&#39;ve a few ideas on what the sword does, but has anyone else written it up for PC use?<br />Thanks

        <p>Long since lost the Sword of Ages is whispered about at campfires before every battle... rumors of one side or the other having this legendary blade fascinate the greens to the delight of veterans.<br /><br />Every warlord that has ever owned the blade speaks through it giving advise in battle, and promoting plans of action that fit their agenda out of battle. Using this blade in battle makes one feel invulnerable and a truly fearsome opponent. Superior Armies have been routed simply by the presence of this Blade.<br /><br />No warrior that has drawn this blade will ever want to use another, and will always strive to have it in their possession.... and constantly seek out those challenges that will prove them to be worthy of the Sword of Ages.<br /><br />Out of battle, the burden of all wars weighs heavily on the user if the Blood Price is not paid at least once every three days.<br /><br />It is also a repository for knowledge as it relates to battles, famous warriors and other military knowledge. It will share this knowledge as long as the Blood Price is paid.</p>

You take +1 when hacking and slashing against them<br />7-9	Pick one:<br />	You get +1 to Defy Danger rolls against the Orcs<br />	You get +1 to Defend rolls against the Orcs<br />	You get +1 to Parley with the Orcs<br />6- 	The Orcs are driven into a frenzy trying to recover the mighty sword. When you damage them, roll two dice and apply the worst result.<br /><br />When you lead your people against their ancestral enemies, roll+WIS<br />10+	Pick three:<br />•	You defeat the enemy army; they will not bother your lands for several years<br />•	You have an opportunity to challenge the enemy leader to single combat (tell us more…)<br />•	Your people do not suffer horrendous losses<br />•	You outshine all rivals during the battle<br />7-9	Pick two:<br />6-	Pick one and I’ll pick one</p>

        <p>I like it, many people will tell you to make it less mechanical and more fictional, but if this works for your group I say...<br /><br />let the Orc world tremble!</p>
