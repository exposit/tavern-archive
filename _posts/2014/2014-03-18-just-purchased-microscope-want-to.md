Just purchased Microscope, want to use it with 3 other adult players to create an RPG setting, didn&#39;t someone post something about that in the tavern not too long ago?  If so could someone point me to that link or or other helpful ones.  Once the world is established we will pick a time frame to run an Dungeon World Campaign.

        <p>You may find <a href="http://www.kjd-imc.org/blog/seekers-of-lore-microscope-age-of-gods/" class="ot-anchor">http://www.kjd-imc.org/blog/seekers-of-lore-microscope-age-of-gods/</a> useful. We ran a <i>Microscope</i> session for the baseline (long ago) and have been using <i>Lexicon</i>-style development after that.</p>

        <p>The game is really easy to pick up.  I&#39;m trying to think of good advice but I can&#39;t think of a tricky area.  I guess the best approach is to post about anything specific you struggle with.</p>

        <p>Microscope is a great basis for a game. We&#39;ve been using in our pirate world game and it has given us a great base to create from. The sequel to it is out now: Kingdom</p>
