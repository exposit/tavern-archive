Here&#39;s the sickenly obvious way to run a great DW game: go out of your way to make sure your players get XP. I&#39;m sure this is old hat for most of you guys, but I&#39;ve never thought of it this way until tonight.<br /><br />Before tonight&#39;s session, I wrote down each PC&#39;s alignment key on an index card. Throughout the game, I made sure that Fenfaril had plenty of opportunities to terrorize folks with magic, Chance had plenty of danger to leap into without a plan, and Drummond could engage in trial by combat.<br /><br />A memorable treasure was looted, a notable monster/enemy defeated, and plenty new was learned about the world.

        <p>And Chance failed miserably at everything she attempted...<br /></p>

        <p>Don&#39;t stop at alignment. Make sure you look at alignment, bonds, and anything else that makes a player what he or she IS. When you incorporate a little bit of what each player wants to accomplish, the XP comes naturally. I now rarely end a session without most end of session aspects, alignments, and bonds resolved.</p>

        <p>Yes, this is terrific advice. I&#39;m also toying with Jason Morningstar&#39;s idea: every PC levels up at every session (at least for short-term campaigns).</p>

        <p>I like to have a copy of the playbooks for myself as well as the players for this exact reason,  as well as having easy reference for class moves.</p>

        <p>Not just in DW, but any game. Look at the advanced moves that the player takes when they level up. These are the parts of their character that they want to emphasize. Is the thief taking more moves that improve his Backstab ability? That may be a good indicator that he wants to be more like an assassin. Plan ahead to give the character a chance to shine by using his moves. Conversely, if no one is taking moves related to a certain type of conflict, then don&#39;t use that conflict.</p>

        <p>Once heard the very profound advice that &quot;everything a player puts on their sheet is something they want to be part of the game.&quot;<br /><br />I try to do that, but it&#39;s hard to keep track of it all.</p>

Stealthiness, their drive, a specific move that will go well in a certain situation, or whatever. Plan events that allow for those opportunities, but don&#39;t force them. Another 1-2 aspects of the characters will come to you naturally as you play as you just remember them during play. By the time you are mid-session, hopefully you will get into a good flow and the players will bring that last bit of what they want to do on their own without your need to remember every little thing. I once planned an entire duel based on the Dashing Hero&#39;s move that calls for one. I knew the player would want to use that move so I presented the situation, but didn&#39;t make him duel. Naturally, as I expected, the player used the move to do it.<br /><br />I tend to ask some questions throughout the session to get more information as well. How the characters feel about a certain event in the game, why they are choosing to do something, etc. This also gives me insight into how their character thinks and what they <b>desire</b>.</p>

        <p>I never thought of that. As a player the only way I think of getting exp is failed rolls then end of session. I have never gotten my drive so through the story I changed it based on my character. I never thought the few times I have ran a game, to give the characters chances to get their drive. Thanks</p>
