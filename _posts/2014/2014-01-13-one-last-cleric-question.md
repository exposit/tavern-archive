One last Cleric question. If Human is used as the race, when the cleric communes, can the player choose a different Wizard spell?﻿<br /><br />The reason I ask is because when you commune it specifically states you lose any learned spells. Race acquired or not, why wouldn&#39;t you forget that one too? And they are both apart of a default class on the same character sheet. Why wouldn&#39;t they specify it was an exception to commune if that is the case? ﻿It sounds like it could go either way due to poor wording.﻿

        <p>Nope! Pick one at character creation.<br /><br />I mean, that&#39;s the rules. When it&#39;s run the GM may let the cleric swap out the wizard spell as game events change and/or at level up .</p>

        <p>I guess coming up with some restricted in game conditions for changing the spell wouldnt be to difficult. Make it a possibility but by no means easy.</p>
