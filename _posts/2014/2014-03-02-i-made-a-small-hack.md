I made a small &quot;hack&quot; to Carouse in our campaign. Basically it&#39;s an extension:<br /><br /><i>If you spent at least 500 coins, and got a 12+, you get all four instead</i>.<br /><br />It was a way for me to encourage spending more money on Carouse, and the players seemed to like it.

        <p>It also meant that it wasn&#39;t a &quot;superior strategy&quot; to just hoard dwarven ale. As the players&#39; HQ is in the &quot;big city&quot;, it seems hard to justify not letting them buy it ad libitum.</p>

        <p>I mean, there&#39;s no real reason (by the rules) why you can&#39;t buy 10 dwarven (for 100 coins) and spend 100 coins to carouse with a +10 modifier.<br /><br />We opted for a maximum of 1 dwarven ale spent per roll, because the alternative seemed a little dumb.</p>

        <p>I think one argument against multiple dwarfen kegs is that no party can drink that much and law of diminishing return. People are happy you brought that good stuff, be it one keg or 4. </p>

        <p>Wasn&#39;t the dwarven keg exclusive to dwarven cities? Like if you want to find one into a non-dwarven settlement, you have to roll for Supply!</p>

        <p>Oooh Yes! Don&#39;t forget to increase the steading&#39;s prosperity while you are it! That poor city just got some more coin bolstering its tavern economy. Maybe it could gain the tag <i>need</i> : <b>Dwarven Ale</b> too ;)<br /><br />You could also offer an additional few choices to the <b>carouse</b> move based on other town moves....<br />like carry 1 forward to either <b>supply</b>, <b>recruit</b> or <b>outstanding warrants</b>.<br />Maybe you have impressed a healer with your partying and you can heal a debility for every two days as per <b>recover</b> .</p>

Finding the ale wouldn&#39;t be a problem.</p>
