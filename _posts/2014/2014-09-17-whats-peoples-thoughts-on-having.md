What&#39;s people&#39;s thoughts on having the bard&#39;s Arcane Art give +armor forward rather than healing? Specifically for a campaign where <b>magical</b> healing is really thin on the ground.

        <p>You could do it. Two things come to mind, though. First, I wouldn&#39;t have the Bard give more than a +1 bonus to armor, otherwise it would be a lot  better than 1d6 recovered hit points. Second, how long would the effect last? Regaining hit points is a one shot deal (that has long term effects). Too long of an effect would again make the armor boost really good.</p>

        <p>Yup. I was thinking that exact thing, <span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink" href="https://plus.google.com/117646243340764868749" oid="117646243340764868749">Nathan Roberts</a></span>.</p>

        <p>well...<br /><br />1. the bard heals 1d8<br />2. I was thinking +2 or +3 armour forward. I.e. against the next attack, and no more.  </p>

        <p>Ha. That&#39;s what I get for not having the book nearby when I answered. :P<br /><br />+3 armor seems like a <i>lot</i> to me. Especially if that bonus sticks around for a while. Each point of armor is essentially giving the character 1 extra hit point per attack they suffer. +3 armor for two attacks saved the character 6 hit points. If that bonus sticks around for three attacks, that&#39;s 9 hit points saved. Better than that d8 of healing.<br /><br />The other thing to consider is a short duration (or requiring rhe Bard to keep performing) means the player is making fewer moves. So there will be fewer opportunities for GM moves.</p>

        <p>The OP explixitly stated that the bonus is +x forward. There is no duration involved in that.<br />I think 1d8 Armor forward would be almost identical in most situations to 1d8 heal, so why not just use that? If you think a preventive shield of that power is too strong go down by 1 or 2 die sizes as you see fit.</p>

        <p>Temp hitpoints in form of a magical shield totally works.</p>

        <p>It&#39;s OT, however, give a look to this &quot;new&quot; bard:<br /><a href="http://rpg.drivethrustuff.com/product/137211/The-Bard--A-Dungeon-World-Playbook" class="ot-anchor">http://rpg.drivethrustuff.com/product/137211/The-Bard--A-Dungeon-World-Playbook</a><br />I love the fact he has no all that buffing others during combats; I feel that part of the &quot;old&quot; bard quite annoying and not fiction-powering.</p>

        <p>I really like that new bard. Will likely be using it in my next campaign :p</p>
