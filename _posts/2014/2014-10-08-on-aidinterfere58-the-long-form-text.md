On Aid/Interfere:<br /><br />The long-form text for the move says &quot;If a player can explain how they’re helping with a move and it makes sense, let them roll to aid.<br /><br />No matter how many people aid or interfere with a given roll, the target only gets the +1 or -2 once. Even if a whole party of adventurers aid in attacking an ogre, the one who makes the final attack only gets +1.&quot;<br /><br />That suggests to me that only one aid roll should be made, by one player - perhaps for the PC with the most relevant bonds then (if that&#39;s not unique) the PC who&#39;s best placed to help in the fiction. Otherwise, you have some people rolling when only the downside can apply to them.<br /><br />Is that how everybody&#39;s doing it?

        <p>Like a lot of questions for DW, I agree, this scenario seems convoluted and hard to determine without knowing the fiction.<br /><br />As the GM, I would ask who&#39;s doing what. If someone is going for the throat, someone&#39;s going for the knees, and someone&#39;s trying to set the ogre on fire, I would say that the throat guy is looking for the kill, so I&#39;d ask more about that move. Then I would say that the knees guy is aiding the throat guy by bringing the monster down so his neck is reachable and exposed, so there&#39;s the aid. After that, I&#39;d still allow the immolation of the ogre to take place, mostly through fiction, but if he&#39;s not dead, maybe we see what happens when a burning, throat-bleeding ogre gets angry.<br /><br />Let the fiction lead. It answers so many questions.</p>

        <p>Yeah, but sometimes you know that the situation is going to have an horrible consequence, by the fiction. So, if you don&#39;t want your comrade mage get his head separated from the neck, go help him! It&#39;s too risky let just one person do all the job...</p>

        <p>Man, I really find myself disliking the Aid/Interfere moves more and more.  They&#39;re pretty much never mechanically &quot;worth it.&quot;  In terms of getting a 6- or a 7-9, rolling twice with the same bonus is about equal to rolling once with a -2.  In exchange for a +1 that ay or may not make a difference?  Not worth the risk.</p>

        <p>My take : Who desires to, and can (within the fiction), aid?  They all commit, then roll.  If any of them get a 7+ there&#39;s a plus one (or minus two, although that hasn&#39;t come up yet for me) to the &#39;main&#39; character&#39;s roll.  Anyone who rolled sub-ten suffers consequences as appropriate.</p>

        <p>There was this one time a player rolled a 6, so someone else rolled to aid and got a 6 too. Then there was an aid roll to the aid roll. Also a 6. <br /><br />Then things went BAD. But it was really fun.</p>

However, that&#39;s down to how the GM handles 9- results on the Aid roll - if they make moves that hurt or endanger the whole party, then the maths has the same consequences as one PC rolling twice.<br /><br />Hmmm... need to think about the consequences of the maths some more (don&#39;t have time right now - am warming up for a DW session).</p>

Which seems...odd. Not alien to *World play - the more moves that trigger, the more chance there is of 6-&#39;s and thus GMs being able to make hard moves, that&#39;s how it always works - but odd in its potential for permitting a sudden hail of hard moves (one actor, three helpers - that opens the door for 4 hard moves, though the odds aren&#39;t good).<br /><br />Of course, the GM can always make a soft move in place of a hard move, or make a hard move that isn&#39;t very hard.</p>

        <p>One related issue - in my limited experience, players seem to feel awkward when they write two or more bonds to the same PC. I&#39;ve encouraged people to do it (in one group I run, there are only three PCs so most classes need to) but it doesn&#39;t seem to happen naturally.<br /><br />Contrast Hx in AW, which can get to +3 and a given PC could, in theory, have that with multiple PCs. (I haven&#39;t played AW at all, so I don&#39;t know what patterns of Hx are common)<br /><br />(For further comparison with related games: Monsterhearts has no direct equivalent of Aid in its basic moves - you can win Strings, but they can only be used for the equivalent of Interfere. That&#39;s quite deliberate - you&#39;re playing troubled people in their difficult teenage years, so the social tactics you have available are crude. All four of the later &quot;Growing Up&quot; moves (earned through advancement) provide some way to help another.)</p>
