Here&#39;s the result of my first Hangout on Air. I don&#39;t really think it needs editing, but there is some foul language. It was a really good session though!<br /><br />Also, it is a little over 3 hours long. If you&#39;d rather not listen to the whole thing, then <span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink" href="https://plus.google.com/117134143142507309944" oid="117134143142507309944">David Guyll</a></span>Â will be typing out a play report at some point this weekend. :)

This will be our 7th session! We have finally figured out how to do this, so hopefully this will help people hear the sessions.

        <p>I&#39;ve been running this in the 13th Age. I&#39;m really going to enjoy listening to how it plays different under Dungeon World!</p>

        <p>I think I will try and edit it some today to shorten it. Just so you know. :)</p>

        <p>This is interesting--a hybrid IRL and Hangout game. I can&#39;t believe how well that works, with the mapping.</p>
