<i>From whybird, on the SomethingAwful forums. Thought this was too good not to share!</i><br /><br />&quot;The session of Dungeon World last night featured the players getting into a cook-off against an undead chef who was being kept alive by a Lovecraftian beast of insatiable appetite so that he could keep on finding it new and exciting flavours.<br /><br />As challenged party, the undead chef got to choose the key ingredient: he went for gelatinous cube. Cue the Artificer setting up a Rube Goldberg-esque trap to dump their gelatinous cube into a vat of marinade, and the Mastermind using his &#39;reveal an enemy to be an ally&#39; move to order the cube &#39;Bad cube! Down! Spit it out!&#39; after it broke free and swallowed members of the party.<br /><br />The ending involved the Fae using her Traitor&#39;s Knife (when she stabs someone with it who trusts her, their flesh becomes magically delicious) to murder some of their rival&#39;s sous-chefs and add them to the marinade, and ended up recreating the Iron Chef episode from Futurama. She has now claimed the undead chef&#39;s enchanted pepper-grinder as her primary weapon.&quot;

        <p>Magically delicious???  Most dragons agree that humanoid flesh is inherently delicious!  Except for troll - they taste bad even to dragons.</p>
