Hey Taverners! I&#39;ve got two questions:<br />1) I&#39;ve been turning magic cards into dungeon world monsters for my own personal monster manual. Would anyone else want these? I could type them up, make it fancy, etc.<br /><br />2) For my GM talk this saturday, is there anything that you want me to talk about/cover?

        <p>I would love that, and for the GM talk, maybe about worldbuilding and its place in dungeon world? </p>

        <p>I&#39;ve also toyed with the idea of turning magic into a DW deck. It has environments, monsters, NPCs, and magic items. </p>

        <p>I&#39;d love to see some Magic monsters. Hell, now that I think of it, I may draft some of my own.</p>

        <p>It&#39;s not hard. I&#39;ve gotten it to the point where I can stat out a monster with moves and descriptions in about 5-10 mins. put on some star trek, and just crank it out!</p>

        <p>That sounds interesting. I&#39;d love to see how you handle things like Slivers and Kavu.</p>

        <p><b>1)</b> YES YES YES! Please!!!<br /><br /><b>2)</b> I would like to see some coverage on the importance of asking questions in a DW game, both before and during. I know I have trouble with this aspect of the game and I&#39;ve seen others ask about it a lot.<br /><br />GM prep is also a hot topic for newbies. How much or little, bringing notes, taking notes mid session, maps and handling blanks, what should a GM bring to the table if they plan on not referencing the rulebook during play, stuff like that.</p>
