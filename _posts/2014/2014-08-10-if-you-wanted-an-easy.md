If you wanted an easy way to group monsters by basically any tags they have (Horde, Messy, Organized, etc.), here is a google spreadsheet I made. I made a &quot;Combat Level&quot; (CL) classification. Use it if you like it!<br /><br /><a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1w-tnlySP7pdcNcBZmK6d7udV6JqccicoMMLjA1f6A64/edit?usp=sharing" class="ot-anchor">https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1w-tnlySP7pdcNcBZmK6d7udV6JqccicoMMLjA1f6A64/edit?usp=sharing</a><br /><br />Suggestions and comments welcome!<br /><br />[EDIT : I modified the link to lead to the last version of the spreadsheet with the CL. The older link won&#39;t work.]
