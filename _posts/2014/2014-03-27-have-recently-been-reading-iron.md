Have recently been reading Iron Kingdoms, from Privateer Press. I thought it would be cool to adjust the hireling rules so that a character could have their own Steamjacks - or, frankly, any sort of automaton.<br /><br />I&#39;m not sure if anyone has put something like this together, so here it is - advice on refinements or clarifications is welcome and desired. <br /><br />All of this is the result of natural outcroppings of the regular hireling rules - I thought they worked far too elegantly for the situation to ignore. This may all be entirely too obvious to take up a post in the community, but i figure, meh, why not? <br /><br /><i>___________</i><br /><br />Mechanical (non-sentient) Hirelings are defined by their SKILL (or skills), a COST, and a FUNCTIONALITY score.<br /><br />&quot;When  a [Mechanical] hireling finds themselves in a dangerous, damaging, or flat out crazy situation due to your orders, roll+FUNCTIONALITY. On a 10+ they stand firm and carry out the order. On a 7-9 they do it, but they are damaged or impeded in some way, reduce FUNCTIONALITY by 1. <br /><br />If a [Mechanical] hireling&#39;s FUNCTIONALITY falls below 0, it is damaged beyond operation. Severe abuse or lack of maintenance may eventually lead to its utter destruction.  <br /><br />A [Mechanical] hireling can be repaired to restore +1 or more FUNCTIONALITY, depending upon the skill of the repairer. The absence of regular maintenance may reduce FUNCTIONALITY by -1.<br /><br />NEW COST: &#39;maintenance and repairs.&#39; <br /><br />A [mechanical] hireling&#39;s starting numbers will be based on where it was acquired or the skill of its inventor, ranging from 2-5, 4-6, 5-8, and 6-10.

        <p>Instead of Functionality, why not reduce a skill by 1 on a 7-9? I did this in my mummy playtest with a giant snake hireling: when <span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink" href="https://plus.google.com/104623400813415689503" oid="104623400813415689503">Melissa Fisher</a></span>&#39;s character would make camp it could regain a lost skill point due to healing.<br /><br />When you make camp, you can use parts or a repair kit to restore 1 point.<br /><br />This could also make a case for upgrading it: you roll+INT, spend parts/cash, take time, and increase a skill point.</p>

        <p>I kind of like those ideas for granularity, <span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink" href="https://plus.google.com/117134143142507309944" oid="117134143142507309944">David Guyll</a></span> - thanks for the suggestions!<br /><br />As I refine this for my players, I might give both versions a try - I didn&#39;t want to stray too far from the standard rules to start, but I like that a mechanical hireling&#39;s abilities can degrade with damage - certainly something to consider.</p>
