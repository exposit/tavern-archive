Been Lurking for a while. Thought that it was about time I contribute. This is a custom class I&#39;m using in a game tonight, inspired by scp 076.<br />Let me know what you think, and where I can improve please. Thanks.﻿<br />The formatting on the preview is weird, currently don&#39;t know how to fix it T_T<br /><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B89EavKzJklhRTYxTDRUTUh0aUE/view?usp=sharing" class="ot-anchor">https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B89EavKzJklhRTYxTDRUTUh0aUE/view?usp=sharing</a><br />Edited!!

        <p>I am a big fan of the darker playbooks, so this is right up my alley. What draws me the most is the shadow traveling. I think that was well done with great choices. One thing that struck me odd was that Walk Through Darkness let&#39;s you traverse shadows without rolling anything, however the Darkening Path does it too, but requires a roll. What does the starting move do for you that Darkening Path does not?﻿<br /><br />Also, the Artisan and Berserker Backgrounds don&#39;t seem to fit as well as the Marksman, as this is seems like more of a discreet playbook. Having some BG&#39;s that emphasize the elements already in the playbook would be neat. Perhaps something that helps shadow travel or some kind of shadow manipulation.﻿<br /><br />Also, in Blood Red, it seems odd, fictionally, that you can spend blood to do things like disarm a foe, free yourelf, etc. I&#39;m not sure how blood feeds into this mechanic. It would seem like it would be more appropriate to have it do something with health, debilities, wounds, or something along those medicinal lines.﻿<br /><br />Solid start here.</p>

Artisan can definitely be reworked/removed though. Walk through Darkness is a short ranged move, as opposed to Darkening path, think more of a blink versus a portal.</p>

        <p>Sure, that makes sense. I just didn&#39;t think that was clear in the wording. I see how you mean it now.</p>

        <p>I forgot to credit Johnstone&#39;s Class Warfare for the bulk of the heavy lifting on this one.</p>
