Tags: Hand, Close, Reach, Near, Far<br /><br />How often do you focus on these in your game?  What are their impact?  <br /><br />Do brass knuckles go toe-to-toe with longswords in Hack &amp; Slash, or do you require clever combat maneuvers?<br /><br />PC charges with dagger [Hand] and enemy has spear [Reach]?  What about when the enemy charges with the dagger, and the PC has the spear?  <br /><br />I have my own opinions on this, but I&#39;m curious what the community thinks!  If someone can point me to a relevant blog, forum or G+ post, I would appreciate that too.

        <p>There was a nice talk about handling distances recently (<a href="http://goo.gl/8T2gdd" class="ot-anchor">http://goo.gl/8T2gdd</a>). I don&#39;t know if it is exactly what you are looking for but check out my very first response in the comment section of that post. It gives an example of how I handle ranges in my game. The general rule of thumb is, handle it in the fiction and allow whatever makes sense in the fiction on a per situation basis.</p>

        <p>My rule of thumb is that closing with someone wielding a longer-reach melee weapon is Defy Danger. Fending off an attacker who uses a shorter-reach melee weapon is easy; until you roll a 6- and they&#39;re inside your guard slashing and stabbing. :)</p>

        <p>Every time it comes up, it gets focused on. You can&#39;t fight a sword with brass knuckles, but you can get inside their guard so the sword is useless (Defy Danger to do so). Same with a spear. Always focus on the ranges, since they&#39;re important to the fiction of the game and the basic bread and butter of the game&#39;s combat. <br /><br />If the enemy has a knife and and you have a spear, it means they won&#39;t charge unless they have to; it means hack and slash can&#39;t be triggered so its either dealing damage or defying danger. It means PCs have the advantage! So the enemies will adjust strategy to cope!</p>

        <p>The tags almost never come up when I&#39;m GMing. I think my players just take it from the fiction that trying to stab a spearman with a dagger is best done from behind, or they&#39;ll just throw it. If they go for it I will make them Defy Danger. Hand vs Close and Near vs Far are basically ignored by me though, I guess it&#39;s not important enough for me to remember.<br /><br />From the enemy&#39;s side, they just do their damage whenever someone rolls H&amp;S 7-9 or sometimes on any move&#39;s miss, without regard to weapon type. I&#39;ve never had a player bring up the tags, as it always seems plausible in the fiction that a shorter weapon or fist might get to them when they mess up.<br /><br />So in the specific case of an enemy with an obviously longer weapon, they have to Defy Danger. Otherwise, neither me nor any player I&#39;ve played with has brought it up that I can remember. <b>shrug</b> I&#39;d be interested to know how you use them!</p>

        <p>Always, but only in comparison to each other.</p>

        <p>Yeah, like Adam says, its the <b>comparison</b> that counts. Unlike Aaron, I hardly ever inflict the monster&#39;s damage when they get an attack, I LOVE making the moves the monster has, which often involve throwing/pushing the characters to Near or Far, smashing/grappling the characters to Close or Hand.<br /><br />I like thinking of &#39;option reduction&#39; in making moves on the players... If they have multiple weapons that work in most ranges, <i>take away their stuff</i> and offer a situation that involves at the range where they have no recourse - it focuses their choices, or in most cases encourages creative ways to overcome obstacles.</p>

Would you use the same tags and how would you play it? The &quot;fire ball&quot; blast range says &quot;near by&quot;. Does that imply the near range? I do not have a problem with its vagueness, the problem is just that if you want explosions of different strengths one may need to be more specific. Thanks!</p>
