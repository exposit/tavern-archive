Seduction<br />When you use the powers of seduction to entice someone who might be interested Roll+CHA. ✴On a 10+ you have the individual enthralled with you. ✴On a 7–9 they are somewhat interested, but (choose one):<br />They have suspicions about your motives.<br />They are in the middle of something and can’t talk now.<br />People start talking about your “ways”.

        <p>I wrote this for bardweek <br /><br />FOOLING AROUND <br />When you seduce a GM character someone after an evening of performance, roll+CHA <br />On a hit you get some interesting information out of the pillow talk. <br />On a 7-9, choose 1 complication <br />- In the heat of the moment you divulge some information you shouldn&#39;t have.  Tell the GM what it is<br />- You get caught by their significant other or parents<br />- They will fall in love with you and will cause a scene <br />You may choose an extra option from the 7-9 list, if you do you learn some information that is useful to your current adventure or troubles.   </p>
