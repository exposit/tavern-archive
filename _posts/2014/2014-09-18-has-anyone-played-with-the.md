Has anyone played with the Immolator class yet, and how do you feel it plays? I&#39;m having some difficulty with the tags on Burning Brand, why does it have both Touch (like a poison?) and the Hand range? Are you incapable of creating a weapon bigger than a dagger without advanced moves? Are you literally just setting your hand on fire and punching people or throwing fireballs?<br /><br />Also, will we be seeing an updated version of this class soon from Sage and Adam?

        <p>Never played the class, but my assumption on Touch was that it was an even shorter range than Hand, and somehow more difficult/dangerous to use.</p>

        <p>The problem with that is unarmed combat counts as hand range. The only thing I could think of is the brand needs to touch them to burn them, but that&#39;s what fire does, we don&#39;t need a game mechanic to tell us that; follow the fiction</p>

        <p>It can be interpreted as more like super heating your hand, making your hand as if it were a hot iron, rather than straight up fire.Â </p>

        <p>Anyone know the average delay between donating and receiving the Immolator?</p>

        <p>Once you have donated make sure to email your receipt to give@dungeon-world.com. I got a response same day (I think I got it in about an hour), check your spam folder if you do not see it</p>
