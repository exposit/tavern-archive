Our gaming group tried something new for a one-shot last week: opening moves. I wanted a quick way to introduce some clues, flavor and possible hooks for the players. I wrote up 6 custom moves, each with a focus on a different stat. The players picked a move they liked the most and included it during character introduction.<br /><br />I was a bit rushed at the end when writing these, so.not all of the choices are that well-considered. I still thought they would be worth posting, though, mostly as food-for-thought.

        <p>The wing-suit&#39;s opening move has an issue. On a 7-9, you&#39;ve set up a non-choice. Of course the players will choose to land safely/without injury. If you find a new thread to fill in, it&#39;d play out better.</p>

        <p>In fairness, the move doesn&#39;t mention injury, but point taken. What would be a better option?</p>

        <p>Ah, for that option, I meant for it to not affect the stats or start the character off with any sort of disability, but instead to add something like either a limp, a fear of heights, a distracting scar, or some other interesting consequence from the bad fall. Maybe just &quot;You hurt yourself bad after you last jump, and now you are afraid of heights&quot; or something like that would be fun.</p>

        <p>Oh, wait, my mistake. I was thinking about the opening move rather than the one associated with the wingsuit. I used &quot;safely&quot; to leave room for interpretation by the GM, but I&#39;d love to hear some other ideas.</p>

        <p>How about this: When <b>you leap from a great height while wearing your wingsuit</b>, state to where you would like to glide and roll+DEX. *On a 10+, choose 2. *On a 7-9, choose 1.<br /><br />* You land where you intended.<br />* You didn&#39;t damage any of your possessions.<br />* You can carry someone with you.</p>
