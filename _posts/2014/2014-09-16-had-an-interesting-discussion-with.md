Had an interesting discussion with &quot;HydraDM&quot; on the  <a rel="nofollow" class="ot-hashtag" href="https://plus.google.com/s/%23dungeonworld/posts">#dungeonworld</a>  Freenode IRC channel over lunch. It was basically rolling Hack &amp; Slash vs the system. &quot;How do you ditch ability scores completely?&quot; was the basic concept.

        <p>Well DW is such a trimmed &amp; simple system for rpgs that taking out the ability scores is possible but at some point that just boils down to rolling a dice to see if you succeed or a storytelling system without the need for dice. I&#39;m fine with the DW ability scores in the game, as simple as they are, as it gives some variety &amp; randomness to the game, the mechanics for rolling them is easy to figure out and the characters more color.</p>

        <p>There are many ways to be rid of ability scores.  DW already takes it halfway though - to do a move, you do it in the fiction.  If you want a fighter to be better at hack and slash (for example) than a wizard, then change the bar for what counts for that move in the fiction.<br /><br />And when you can, adjust the consequences.  If it&#39;s something a character would be bad at, maybe a 7-9 still triggers the GM making a hard move.</p>

        <p>Base bonuses to moves on fictional inputs rather than stats.  Like this!<br /><br /><a href="https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0B0lFq3ECDQDQdkVSYzYyeFY1OEU&amp;usp=sharing" class="ot-anchor">https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0B0lFq3ECDQDQdkVSYzYyeFY1OEU&amp;usp=sharing</a></p>
