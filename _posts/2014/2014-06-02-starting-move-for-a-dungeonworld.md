Starting move for a  <a rel="nofollow" class="ot-hashtag" href="https://plus.google.com/s/%23dungeonworld/posts">#dungeonworld</a>    <a rel="nofollow" class="ot-hashtag" href="https://plus.google.com/s/%23baseclass/posts">#baseclass</a>   I&#39;m fiddling with...<br /><br /><b>A Stranger&#39;s Face</b><br />When you <i>focus your mind and envision a desired form</i> choose a humanoid race and a sex and roll+CHA. On a hit your body morphs and changes to sort of match your mental image. You&#39;ll look like an ordinary person of that race and sex, and no one will recognize you for who you were before. On a 10+ choose one:<br />- Your visage is beautiful or attractive for the race. Gain +1 forward to parley with anyone who would be attracted to your sex.<br />- You look so normal that unless you actively draw attention to yourself, people will forget they ever saw you once you leave their presence.<br />- You can maintain a distinctive feature such that people who know you for who you are will recognize you when they see you.

        <p>You are right about adjusting abilities up and down the roll result scale. I wrote a move once that had full success only on 12+ and expanded partial success to 7-11. Why? Because it is powerful and should be risky.</p>
