I&#39;m going to need groups to playtest <b>World of Metal and Bone</b>, my version of <span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink" href="https://plus.google.com/105271402896646043604" oid="105271402896646043604">Tracy Barnett</a></span>&#39;s Iron Edda using the Apocalypse World/Dungeon World rules engine. While it is powered by the Apocalypse, knowledge of other *World games is not required. <br /><br />I&#39;m looking for folks who can play at least a couple of times in the next month. Comment below if you&#39;re interested. Feel free to tell me how many players you may have, and if you have experience with *World games, epic and/or Norse-inspired fantasy, or whatever else you think I might find interesting.

        <p>Happy to provide feedback on drafts, especially basic moves, but my playtest is schedule is currently pretty full (mostly with other AW hacks).</p>

        <p>My group has zero experience with World games. I&#39;m running my first DW this Friday and not with my regular group.<br /><br />That said, we are down to try and this one is right in my wheelhouse. I wrote an epic Viking fantasy that I think is in line with World sensibilities. (I will provide a copy to prove bona fides.)<br /><br />We have 5 players, meet weekly and it is rare to have one person missing. Two is unheard of.<br /><br />Give us a shot, Coach! :)</p>

        <p>I was away for the holiday weekend, so I wanted to wait until I was home (which I now am). I will be sending it out shortly.</p>
