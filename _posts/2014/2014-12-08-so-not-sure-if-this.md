So not sure if this is the right place to ask about this, I assume someone will let me know if it isn&#39;t :)<br /><br />One of the primary reasons I am interested in DW is because of the sixth world hack that brings in the shadowrun setting, so I am wondering... does anyone here have experiences playing with it? Are there anything they would change/add or stuff that doesn&#39;t work, or something that works really well?<br /><br />I haven&#39;t run DW yet, but I am going to and once I have a few DW sessions under my belt, I think I&#39;ll look at a sixth world game. Any insights are very welcome :)<br /><br />Link for the sixth world hack: <a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/986437/sixth_world_revised.pdf" class="ot-anchor">https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/986437/sixth_world_revised.pdf</a>

        <p>I was starting to run <i>Sixth World</i> a few months ago, but only got two sessions in before scheduling conflicts scuppered the plan. We felt like we only scratched the surface of what we could do with it, and were really keen on what we <i>were</i> able to do with the little bit we were using.</p>

        <p>That does look interesting, though I am mostly interested in the shadowrun setting, &quot;pure&quot; cyberpunk doesn&#39;t do that much for me.</p>

        <p>Huh, and I see that one of the stretch goals include &quot;Touched&quot;... will be looking into this :)</p>

        <p>Hehe, the name &quot;Sixth World&quot; is a reference to the Shadowrun Setting. They loosely use Tolkien&#39;s and the Mayan calender to have the age when the dragons reawaken, magic returns, people are born as orcs/elves etc, be the 6th age, hence Sixth World.</p>
