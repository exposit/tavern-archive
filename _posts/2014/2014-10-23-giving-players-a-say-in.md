Giving players a say in the 6- results. Do you?<br /><br />I occasionally try to go &quot;ok, so you failed your shot. What else did go wrong?&quot; It depends on the players (and I sure have a veto), but usually the results are fine.  Like &quot;So I missed, and the arrow hit... the torch, so we are all in dark now?&quot;<br /><br />I found that players who occasionally depict their own failures will more generously accept when I make a harsh move on them.

        <p>Really really rarely. It is not the players job to decide these things.</p>

        <p>Also people often default to &quot;I don&#39;t do what I wanted to do&quot; when &quot;you do what you do and something. Bad happens because of that&quot; or &quot;you are a out to do X but then something horrible happens and you don&#39;t even get to do what you wanted to do&quot; often are things you want to do instead.</p>

        <p>I see, so this really depends on the players personalities then. I&#39;m in a group where players would sacrifice their PCs without second thought to advance an awesome story, and I kinda assumed that would be the usual perception of what a PC is there for. Guess survival instinct also got a say.</p>

        <p>If we&#39;re sticking to the rules as written, you can of course disclaim decision making, ask questions etc. Asking a loaded question like that is a valid way to go about it. It just shouldn&#39;t be the default and you should remember to ask a question that falls within the purview of the character, without crossing &quot;the line&quot;.<br /><a href="http://mightyatom.blogspot.com/2010/10/apocalypse-world-crossing-line.html" class="ot-anchor">http://mightyatom.blogspot.com/2010/10/apocalypse-world-crossing-line.html</a><br /><br />But AW games are inherently hackable/driftable by default, so don&#39;t worry about it too much as long as it&#39;s a thoughtful change that works within the context of your group.</p>

        <p>On a 6- the GM makes as hard a move as they like, and that definitely includes giving the players a hard choice or opportunity! <br /><br />&quot;You can save your arm, but only if you chop off your hand...&quot;<br /><br />That&#39;s particularly brutal, but giving players hard choices on a 6- is a fun and engaging way to play.</p>

        <p>Generally no. Not for reasons of trust or consequence, but more for pacing.  Functionally speaking, a 6- most often gives a scene a new thrust, and that kind of transition works best when inertia is maintained.<br /><br />That said, so fas as I&#39;m concerned, players should have already told you what happens on a 6-.  When the description of action is sufficiently well framed to merit a die roll, the implications of success and failure should already be visible, at least in outline.  If I cannot see the 6- (or the 7-9) before the dice hit the table, <b>that</b> is the point where I ask some question.<br /><br />Caveat: I&#39;m speaking generally.  There are absolutely situations where I will ignore my own advice.  But this is my general take. </p>

        <p>When a player totally hoops themselves and is knocking on Death&#39;s door, I&#39;ve had really good luck just asking, &quot;okay, hotshot, how on earth do you survive this?&quot;</p>
