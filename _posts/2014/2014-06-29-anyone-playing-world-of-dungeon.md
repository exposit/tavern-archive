Anyone playing world of dungeon. Every time I think of playing some classic dnd (basic) I think this would be more fun and pretty lite compared to DW, although would probably use the same moves as dungeon world.

        <p>Yeah I actually built part of my game <a rel="nofollow" class="ot-hashtag" href="https://plus.google.com/s/%23nocountryforoldkobolds/posts">#nocountryforoldkobolds</a> on it because it is so light and allows for really quick character generation when need be. Overall it&#39;s a wonderful distillation of DW. I find that some players have issues figuring out when skills should be used but it&#39;s easy enough to get people thinking in the way the system does.</p>

        <p>I especially like it for convention play because it is so easy to pick up. Planarch Codex also uses it for a base.</p>

        <p>I&#39;ve played more World of Dungeons than I have Dungeon World.</p>
