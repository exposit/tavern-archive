Here is the updated spreadsheet I made with all the monsters from the core book. Now, if someone knows how to make something automatically take the info from the monsters a user want and print something similar to what is in the core book, <i>that</i> would be really nice! (I don&#39;t know how to do it; I don&#39;t even know if that&#39;s possible to do from a spreadsheet.) <br /><br />It now contains the &quot;kind-of-power-level&quot; category that I was asking about in the first place (it did not seem to exist, so I did one). It&#39;s not perfect, but I&#39;m fairly happy with it.

        <p>Not sure I can do it in a G-Docs spreadsheet, but I&#39;ve got a lot of experience in using spreadsheets as flat-file databases, and yes, what you&#39;re proposing is probably doable.<br /><br />It would almost certainly be MORE usable as an actual database. :)</p>

        <p>Well <span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink" href="https://plus.google.com/110585918309275275520" oid="110585918309275275520">Ken Burnside</a></span>, I would definitely use something like that if you want to do it (I don&#39;t know how!)</p>

        <p>If Ken doesn&#39;t have time to do it, I might be able to whip something together... surely there&#39;s an online one already, though?</p>

        <p>I won&#39;t be able to touch this before GenCon - but if it hasn&#39;t been done, I&#39;ll throw an hour at it.<br /><br />The tricky part is getting Google Spreadsheets to use INDEX and MATCH properly, and making sure that the number of fields in each entry is consistent.<br /><br />In Excel, this might take some munging, but is definitely doable.</p>

        <p>Since some people may do a &quot;stat block printing app&quot; or something like that, I did a couple of statblock mockups. Nothing fancy (I used Google spreadsheet), but it&#39;s clear enough. <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B61aqMFLBGDpVXZTc1NpZ0gxc2s/edit?usp=sharing" class="ot-anchor">https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B61aqMFLBGDpVXZTc1NpZ0gxc2s/edit?usp=sharing</a> <br /><br />DW stat blocks are pretty good, but I think that the weapon tags should follow the damage (like piercing) instead of following range tags : when I make an attack, I want ranges to &quot;pop out&quot;, but when I describe consequences, I want to see weapon tags &quot;pop out&quot;. Since the weapon tags are often going to be relevant in the fiction at the same time that damage is rolled, it just feels better like that.<br /><br />Instinct should also be more conspicuous since it tells the way a monster will act. I also like to know their setting and the reference.<br /><br />My favorite is the 4th, and I don&#39;t really like the 2nd. :) Feel free to comment and share! </p>
