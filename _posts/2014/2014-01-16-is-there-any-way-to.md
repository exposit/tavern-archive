Is there any way to get a dump of all the entries in the Monster Codex? Or a way to generate an index? Also I notice that a Google search returns pages for &quot;all monsters created by a given profile&quot; but I can&#39;t find any links to these pages from the Codex itself. I wonder how Google is finding them?<br /><br />Browsing brings up monsters in random order, and every time you close the page and come back you have to start again at the beginning. Given the number of entries I doubt I&#39;ll ever manage toÂ browse to the far end of the database! That means there are some monsters I will never see.<br /><br />I could in theory find them via search, but that presupposes that I could think of what to search for. If is something new and cool that I&#39;d never think of (which is what I am most interested in), chances are it would never come up in a search.<br /><br />I would like four things:<br /><br />First, random access. A mode where the entries are displayed as a scrollable list, with the ability to sort or filter based on some classification. Search results could be displayed this way as well.<br /><br />Second, offline access. I have played DW while backpacking, and in places where I had a computer but no internet access. I would love to have this database available offline.<br /><br />Third, a way to manage favorites. I can add favorites, but cannot un-favorite something if I accidentally click it, and there is no way to see an index of things I&#39;ve favorited.<br /><br />Fourth, the ability to add personal notes to an entry, create a variant of an entry (and have it associated). This could be part of an offline mode instead of online, its just for personal use.

        <p>There have been many requests for modifications for accessing the Codex in the short time I&#39;ve been a DW fan. The general consensus is that change is in the works and patience is a virtue. I like your suggestions. I wouldn&#39;t mind seeing all of those features implemented <span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink" href="https://plus.google.com/100107644985752808795" oid="100107644985752808795">Mike Harvey</a></span>.</p>
