I&#39;ve been thinking about making a Druid move/item/fictionally-learned-ability that allows our druid to do &quot;quick change&quot; actions, where he quickly shifts in then out of a form to do something (eg. turn into something fast to catch up to a foe, then change back to halfling/into something else to attack). It feels like this doesn&#39;t really fit with the gain hold function of the regular shapeshift since he&#39;s only changing briefly. I&#39;ve been inspired by some video games like Bayonetta where the animal forms are mostly a means of traversal but the actual fighting is performed in human form. The changes can be very rapid.<br /><br />Any ideas for mechanics to go with this? Or should I just make it descriptive? It&#39;s mostly an idea for a coolness/flavour thing, so maybe if he&#39;s not involving an attack it&#39;s just something that he gets to make happen without a shapeshift roll? What do you guys think?

        <p>I personally feel that &quot;it takes time to transform&quot; is one of the few things that puts some control on a Druid. <br /><br />However, <br /><br />When you shapeshift into an animal instantly, roll to Shapechange as normal but receive 1 less hold. </p>

        <p>Who says the druid has to shift back to their &quot;normal&quot; form to shapechange into something else?</p>

        <p>Maybe the established fiction?</p>

        <p>Advanced Move: Predator/Prey<br /><br />When the Druid shapeshifts and has 3 hold they can spend 1 hold to turn into their CURRENT forms natural predator or prey without having to re-roll their shape shifting move.<br /><br />You coudl turn into a gazelle, spend one hold for the gazelle move: Out run enemies, then spend one hold for Predator/Prey and turn into a lion then still have one hold leftover for any lion moves; terrify roar, mauling swipe, etc...<br /><br />Just spitballing...</p>

        <p>That might just be better then the Chimera move? </p>

        <p>Looks like it treads on Chimera a little bit but you are more limited in your options. Plus, it&#39;s sequential. A move like that WITH chimera would be pretty crazy!</p>

        <p>Chimera gives you more options since it doesn&#39;t require a hold to change your mind.<br /><br />Like I said, just spitballing.</p>
