After quite a bit of work, I put my final version of the Elemental Master up on Dive Thru RPG. Here&#39;s the link:Â <br /><br /><a href="http://rpg.drivethrustuff.com/product/136952/The-Elemental-Master?term=the+elemental+master" class="ot-anchor">http://rpg.drivethrustuff.com/product/136952/The-Elemental-Master?term=the+elemental+master</a><br /><br />There are several prior iterations floating around in the Tavern, so if they looked like something you might be interested, check it out! :)<br /><br />Anyway, a great many thanks goes out to everyone who either provided feedback or who did some playtesting - its always a true and distinct pleasure to kick ideas around with DW fans.
