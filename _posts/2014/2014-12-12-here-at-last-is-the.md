Here, at last, is the first of four episodes of The Trial of Dungeon World.<br /><br />Again, big thanks to Jessa from TheJessaChannel on youtube for being our guest DM and teaching us the ropes of Dungeon World. The Youtube version is up already if anyone is more of a visual person. I like audio only better, myself but there was some funny chatter going back and forth on the chat that you won&#39;t hear in this version.<br /><br /><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYmKC4UYIe0" class="ot-anchor">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYmKC4UYIe0</a><br /><br />We have 4 episodes coming out pretty close together and then next week we have a Table Topics with all four of our players to discuss the experience.<br /><br /><br /><a href="http://bit.ly/1wCtqr5" class="ot-anchor">http://bit.ly/1wCtqr5</a>
