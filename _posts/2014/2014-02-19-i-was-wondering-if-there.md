I was wondering if there were any sites or tools people used for keeping track of Fronts?  I know I&#39;ve considered using a kanban board, something like Trello, but I&#39;m always interested in seeing new approaches. Thanks!

        <p>Beyond the sheets included? I don&#39;t have any specific tools that I use. I find those or writing them down in Word is easy enough. What kind of tracking did you have in mind?<br /><br />An alternative to Fronts is Conspyramids which I&#39;ve heard many great things about. Not sure how many folks use them for DW but the setup and purpose is the same. You can learn more about them here (<a href="http://goo.gl/yt28xc" class="ot-anchor">http://goo.gl/yt28xc</a>).</p>

        <p>I keep Fronts as well as all my other notes in Evernote. After each session I write notes about the session, and each front.<br /><br /><span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink" href="https://plus.google.com/114124925422808188628" oid="114124925422808188628">Marques Jordan</a></span> will check out the conspyramids as well. Thanks.</p>

        <p>If you are using a kanban board, are you only allowed to have two active fronts at a time?</p>

        <p>I know a lot of folks around here use Google Docs but that is for its easy sharing capabilities. I too use Evernote (<a href="http://goo.gl/IMuafo" class="ot-anchor">http://goo.gl/IMuafo</a>) every day but I&#39;ve never kept any DW related stuff in it. It is a fantastic note taking tool. Access your notes anywhere, on any device. However, in terms of layout tools there isn&#39;t much beyond basic Microsoft Word capability.<br /><br />For Kanban style note keeping there is Kanban Flow (<a href="http://goo.gl/OIk3lB" class="ot-anchor">http://goo.gl/OIk3lB</a>). For mind-mapping style note keeping there is FreeMind (<a href="http://goo.gl/obnG1a" class="ot-anchor">http://goo.gl/obnG1a</a>). A lot of people use Scrivener which is intended for writers who are keeping track of all aspects of their stories as they develop them. It isn&#39;t free though but they have a 30 day free trial (<a href="http://goo.gl/bBT4cB" class="ot-anchor">http://goo.gl/bBT4cB</a>). A less visually impress alternative to Scrivener is yWriter and it is free (<a href="http://goo.gl/gseY5X" class="ot-anchor">http://goo.gl/gseY5X</a>).<br /><br />Obsidian Portal is a full fledged wiki option aimed specifically at Tabletop gamers but it is probably overkill for tracking just the Fronts (<a href="http://goo.gl/0lDFcf" class="ot-anchor">http://goo.gl/0lDFcf</a>). While designed for D&amp;D 4E the program Masterplan would be able to track fronts quite nicely (<a href="http://goo.gl/QyvAiB" class="ot-anchor">http://goo.gl/QyvAiB</a>). That same author put out a program specifically aimed at tracking plot threads called Labyrinth which might be useful(<a href="http://goo.gl/utjbyb" class="ot-anchor">http://goo.gl/utjbyb</a>).<br /><br />I&#39;ve heard great things about TiddlyWiki (<a href="http://goo.gl/Frh3pc" class="ot-anchor">http://goo.gl/Frh3pc</a>).  TiddlyWiki. It&#39;s a wiki in a single file, which saves edits to itself using Javascript. It&#39;s quick and very flexible. You can create a short article on each thing in the game that you want to track: every magic item, game session, player, character, adventure, dungeon room, and so forth. By categorizing articles using tags, you can make it very easy to find obscure information.<br /><br />These are all of the digital tools that come to mind. There is a whole world of possibilities if we&#39;re talking about physical note taking. Stationary is king ^_^</p>

        <p>Thanks for all of the replies! I have Scrivener, so I may give that a shot, as well as Evernote.  I definitely have my index cards. =)</p>
