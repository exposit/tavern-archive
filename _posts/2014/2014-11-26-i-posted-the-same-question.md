I posted the same question on the Story Games forum, but it can&#39;t hurt to ask it here, as well. I finally read World of Dungeons and the Planarch Codex, which I&#39;m really excited about.<br /><br />I&#39;m currently wondering about the heritage moves. I can understand why you would want to use the hold mechanics in standard Dungeon World, sort of like the Mutant&#39;s move in Adventures on Dungeon Planet; but in WoDu, couldn&#39;t you just state the heritage moves and use them without limit, just like any other &quot;do something risky&quot; move? Limiting their uses seems artificial; while it seems that their limitless use would make heritage moves ultra-lite playbook moves.

        <p>I was never a big fan of heritage moves for some reason but the way it is handled in Class Warfare with the Monstrous Heritage specialty tipped me over.Â </p>

        <p>Ouch! I&#39;ve been drooling over that book, but after a long (subjectively) uninteresting period Kickstarter has a gazillion interesting and expensive things going on right now. Maybe I&#39;ll wait a while...</p>
