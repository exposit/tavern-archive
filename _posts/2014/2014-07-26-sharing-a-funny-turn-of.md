Sharing a funny turn of events from a game I&#39;m running.<br /><br />One player is playing Jacob Randolph&#39;s Mage class, which is immensely powerful. He keeps rolling badly, though. Rather than hand him simple failure or complications, I&#39;ve almost uniformly given him Uncontrolled Success. As a Storm focused mage, he has:<br /><br />- summoned a tornado when he just meant to make his party run faster<br />- Summoned a blizzard when he tried to summon a light rainn for concealment purposes<br />- Hit <i>everyone</i> with lightning<br /><br />He&#39;s afraid to use his powers for something minor. Mission accomplished.

        <p>You&#39;re lucky because for a lot of people that would have the opposite effect.</p>

        <p>My Wizard cast an over-sensitive Alarm which triggered and woke her every time a bat or owl flew over the party. She&#39;s never used it since.</p>
