Heres an idea that you can implement if you are a DM to make games feel more interesting. Implement what I call &quot;dream sequences&quot; in your games. You can either make it so your players use it like a custom move. like this for an example<br /><br />Roll plus WIS.<br />On a 10+ you have a nice dream and have a good vision(Gm will tell you something useful about it) You get a +2 forward to your next roll<br /><br />On a 7-9 You start off with a nice vision but it keeps changing dreams. (Gm will tell you something interesting) you get +1 Forward<br /><br />On a 6 You have a nightmare and awaken with Scared, Shaky,Weak, and or sick. (GM choses which ones based on the nightmare.)<br /><br />You can have it where it gives you hints on the story or visions of your Pcs past to make personal. I sometimes even have them in a battle with strange creatures or Npcs they met and they will wake up with the wounds still on them sometimes to really scare them. My players love it when I do it at the just the right time like before a big battle or an important plot point. Dont over due it but if you do it just right it makes for an interesting experience. The dream sequences isnt for all players but with the right group it can be different.

        <p>You could allow the player to tell what&#39;ll happen on a success. Like:<br />Lucid dreaming, roll + Wis<br />On a 10+ pick 3<br />On a 7-9 pick 2<br />- you wake up safely where you were<br />- you wake up where you want<br />- you see one fact about the future<br /><br />On a 6- nightmares pick you<br /></p>

        <p>Interesting... I thought of something else that might even be more interesting.. Sleepwalking. This would happen only if the player rolls snake eyes or up to GM discretion or maybe he picked up a magic item and it was cursed somehow or something like that but if he does he acts out what they dream. Like if he got nightmare he attacks the other players thinking they are monsters in there dream or something like that. </p>

        <p>What triggers this? They go to sleep and say they want to dream? Eat magic mushrooms?</p>

The first I would do it randomly and ask them to roll to spice up the game to make them learn about their past or an impending doom. Another group I had it so if they slept in a dungeon and it would be magic that enticed their dreams. or some items or foods they ate that were poisonous or had magic that they couldn&#39;t identify. Both worked out pretty well.</p>
