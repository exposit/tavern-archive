2nd Edition, Extra Classes

Yes, it has been a long time since I posted about it, but the ebbs and flows of typographic work are truly treacherous and imprevedible. I beg your pardon for my lateness.
Let's refresh your collective memory.

Narrattiva is making a second edition of Dungeon World in Italian.
This new edition will bring a lot of changes from the old edition: more handy format, with external graphic that will not fail to recall some old manual of the dungeonesque and dragonesque persuasion, Inverse World published besides the basic Dungeon World and so on.

Long story short: we would like to publish some new classes with it.
FOUR total classes.
Two will be published with the manual, two will be reserved for exclusive promotional material (someone said "color"? I don't know, I cannot hear well from here).

I've recieved a lot of submission since my last post. Most are very well written, some are really wonderful.
Two of my personal favourites are The Kobold from +Shadi Alhusary (http://rpg.drivethrustuff.com/product/131904/The-Kobold-A-Dungeon-World-Playbook) and The Spellslinger by +Adrian Thoen (http://rpg.drivethrustuff.com/product/112749/The-Spellslinger--A-Dungeon-World-Playbook), just to give you examples of the high quality of the submissions we recieved.

We still have a few days before starting the translation and adaptation process, so, if you want to partecipate, you can send your classes to italianDW2@gmail.com

As always I cannot offer anything concrete to the selected author(s). There isn't a "prize", there isn't any concrete compensation for being chosen. What I can promise is your class published in a classy, gorgeus edition of the game, fully credited to you, and the little honor and glory that comes from beign, after all, a translated game designer.

A few days left. italianDW2@gmail.com. Honor and glory in Italy.

Can you raise to it?</a>

        <p>Off topic questions: Do you still have my commented PDF? Will you patch the translation? Semi-seriously: will you change the Rodomonte&#39;s name choice?</p>

        <p>No off topic, please, I need this thread to be clean.<br />The Swashbuckler will not be included in the next edition, nor will the other two old extra classes.</p>

        <p>A few days, mh...?<br />I&#39;ll try to wrap up the ideas we ( <span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink" href="https://plus.google.com/102615284157527331497" oid="102615284157527331497">Michela Da Sacco</a></span> and me) had, before a tidal wave of work swept away my free time.</p>

        <p>VERY FEW Mattia.<br />I had less time to make the second announce than I would have liked.<br /><br />VERY, VERY FEW. I sincerely doubt you can wrap a whole class before we announce our decision.<br /><br />BUT if you want to try... you have the mail and it beign in Italian could give you a little edge on our production times.<br /><br />Let&#39;s be clear to everyone. When I say &quot;very little time&quot; I&#39;m speaking about days <i>at most</i>,</p>

        <p>Yeah, I would have liked to do more posts about this, not just the one at the beginning and this at the very end, but, you know... tipography, am I right? XD</p>

        <p>Yep.<br />I asked Michela... we&#39;re NOT able to do a decent job in the next few days.<br /><br />So, expect our Class (The Fiend Weapon, inspired and linked to a certain webcomic project we&#39;re going to create) to be given away for free at some Indie &#39;Con.</p>
