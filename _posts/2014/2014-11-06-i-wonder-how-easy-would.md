I wonder how easy would it be to use those old basic D&amp;D modules as a GUIDE to run as an adventure in DW? Not word for word (Leave blank spaces)... just as a basic guide.

        <p>Very very easy. Nearly all of my <i>Dungeon World</i> games have  been more or less from existing fantasy adventure modules.</p>

        <p>Thinking of starting with B1 Into the Unknown. Then I&#39;ve always loved the Giant modules.</p>

        <p>That&#39;s a great choice for DW. It&#39;s like the definition of &quot;draw maps, leave blanks.&quot;</p>

        <p>I used the original Ravenloft module. It was not as good as improv, but that may be just me.</p>

        <p>I also thought about using S1 Tomb of Horrors (?). But I thought the traps and the Lich at the end might be a bit much. Maybe after we all get the hang of the game.</p>

        <p>Dwellers of the Forbidden City, I think it was I1, makes for a fantastic DW adventure. Awesome location, lots of factions and NPC&#39;s and no real plot-arcs. Its less of an adventure and more of a micro-sandbox filled with adventure potential.</p>

        <p>One of the DW campaigns I am running does this. We are doing secret of bone hill right now, very easy, just use the material as your starting point. The rumours in that one were great fun.</p>

        <p>I&#39;ve had great success, especially after I allowed myself to change the content of the module on the fly to suit the game at hand.</p>
