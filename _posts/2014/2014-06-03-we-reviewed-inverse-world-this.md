We reviewed Inverse World this morning.  It&#39;s a really cool and, in the best sense of the word, fantastical DW supplement that I can&#39;t seem to stop playing:  <a href="http://www.gamer-xp.com/reviews-flying-high-with-inverse-world/" class="ot-anchor">http://www.gamer-xp.com/reviews-flying-high-with-inverse-world/</a><br /><br />Anyone else familiar?  Our playtest group has been pretty rabid about it since we discovered it, and I&#39;d love to hear other peoples&#39; thoughts.

        <p>I&#39;m running a biweekly(ish) game with some friends of mine. It&#39;s easily my favorite Dungeon World setting, in part because there&#39;s the right combination of &quot;things to explore,&quot; and &quot;things that are known.&quot;<br /><br />I did rewrite a couple of things for my campaign to make it more exploration-focused. For instance, we no longer &quot;overcome an enemy&quot; for XP. Instead, we &quot;change a place, for better or worse.&quot; And I&#39;ve incorporated my Investigate a Scene move, because I like to run mystery stories.<br /><br />There&#39;s also an Inverse World community here on G+, too.</p>

        <p>I really like that XP hack, Stephanie, I&#39;m gonna have to steal that for my own game.</p>

        <p>I actually think the alternate XP made it into the final book, if I&#39;m not wrong.</p>

        <p>There are mechanical changes to the core game in the book?</p>

        <p>Pretty sure it&#39;s in the Additional Rules section, I think.</p>

        <p>Need to check again. Maybe I don&#39;t have the final PDF on my computer<br />...</p>

        <p>It&#39;s on page 188, and it replaces &quot;did we loot a memorable treasure?&quot; Overcoming a monster or enemy is still there. Considering the loot-focused nature of Inverse World (captain has trade, the collector collects things, etc.), I keep the treasure XP and ditch the monster XP. For us, the game isn&#39;t about killing things. It really shouldn&#39;t be about taking stuff, either-- I might rewrite that one as well to something like &quot;did we make an ally or enemy&quot;? to push a social XP on the PCs.</p>

        <p>Inverse World seriously rocks. This is the game I had been waiting for. Kudos to Jacob.</p>
