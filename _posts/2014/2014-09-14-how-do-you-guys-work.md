How do you guys work on your custom character sheets? Do you make them from scratch, is there a base template out there?

        <p>I think a lot of people make their own, but I like to lurk and pick up templates when they&#39;re posted - here&#39;s one that should work with word <a href="https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B3jBKG-w4xhFSWpRb042a1RZaTg/edit" class="ot-anchor">https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B3jBKG-w4xhFSWpRb042a1RZaTg/edit</a> (I probably have more somewhere, but my favourites is a massive mess of links xP)</p>

        <p>Well that certainly gets the job done, it&#39;s a really well done template. Thanks a lot.</p>
