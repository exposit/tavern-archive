My first shot at a monster. Although I am envisioning it as a pretty nasty critter, the dmg seems a bit high to me...based on this image:Â  <a href="http://www.deviantart.com/art/Guts-Harvester-61139506" class="ot-anchor">http://www.deviantart.com/art/Guts-Harvester-61139506</a><br /><br />Here is link to the codex: <a href="http://codex.dungeon-world.com/monster/4766798176059392" class="ot-anchor">http://codex.dungeon-world.com/monster/4766798176059392</a>

This nasty mammal lives entirely on a diet of entrails and intestines. It uses its large tusk like teeth to disembowel its prey and to scoop up the boun...

        <p>Wow, that&#39;s a killer! ;-) I think maybe you&#39;re right, a bit too high on the damage, but would have to see how it plays out. The tags and story already make it fairly lethal, and it&#39;s hefty on HPs too. Let us know how it plays!</p>

        <p>Well, I threw this guy at my players last night. Went over pretty well. It did bash the paladin and fighter pretty bad, they survived, but I do think I am going to drop the dmg down a bit, maybe 1d8+2 I am thinking... For the HP, it actually worked well, but my group consists of a fighter, barbarian, paladin, ranger, and cleric, so the damage output can be pretty high. The paladin insists he will have recurring nightmares about being covered in rotting intestines :P</p>
