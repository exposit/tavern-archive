<b>GAME INVITATION</b><br /><br />Tragedy has befallen me... Our weekly session got cancelled due to sickness, just after I got well myself &gt;_&lt;<br /><br />Sigh...<br /><br />As such I&#39;ll host a one-shot via hangouts. If anyone&#39;s interested, it&#39;ll be at 7 PM, UTC+1. Anyone can join, but I&#39;d like to keep down to three players, due to the limitations of hangout gaming.<br /><br /><b>Game pitch</b><br /><br /><i>A mystic, crimson portal was uncovered below Castle Thornhold after an old wall accidentally collapsed, revealing a section of the castle previously unknown.</i><br /><br /><i>Lady Moriana Rosethorn, matriarch of house Rosethorn and resident of Thorn, feared where it might lead. In an attempt to uncover this mystery, she hired a band of adventurers to go through, but alas they did not return. After fourteen days, the portal was sealed off from the rest of the castle out of fear.</i><br /><br /><i>Last night however, young Lord Byros, firstborn of Moriana and heir to House Rosethorn was abducted, and the seal to the portal was broken. A note was placed at the stairs to the portal. &quot;Life for life, blood for blood.&quot;</i><br /><br /><i>You have all been summoned, and your goal is simple; retrieve young Byros Rosethorn. Should you succeed, one of the most influential nobles in the land will forever be in your debt.</i><br /><br />Character level : 8.
