This is the format I have also used in <i>Something Stirs in the Blackscale Brakes</i> and <i>If These Stones Could Scream</i>.<br /><br />It works for me and seems to fill in the blanks, but I am curious if you think anything is missing or could be formatted better.<br /><br /> <a rel="nofollow" class="ot-hashtag" href="https://plus.google.com/s/%23dungeonworld/posts">#dungeonworld</a> Â

        <p>I like the idea of being explicit with the location/dungeon moves for new  DW DMs (or wannabes like me!). It helps spur the imagination to think along similar lines, especially if you provide an example move filling each type sequentially... even though naming the move violates the principle of &quot;don&#39;t name your move.&quot;<br /><br />Reading your explanation and example is helping me understand the format of a great steading.  Thanks!</p>

        <p>This is the format I am going to be using for Sundered World and my next adventure, There Was a Method to Her Madness: rather than write it all up and go through the arduous process of updating it down the road, I figure I would find out if anyone thinks it could be improved. :-)</p>
