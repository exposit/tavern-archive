I&#39;m looking to start a long running game of Dungeon World utilizing play by post forums and Class Warfare characters. <br /><br />I have laid out a very vague but pretty grim outline of the world and my brain is overflowing with ideas on how to GM this way, I really hope that I can make it work, <br /><br />I have a few players and a few potentially interested but I am looking for players that would be willing to do regular updates. Exact details can be nailed down by discussion but maybe an update once a day or once every 36 hours as a minimum?<br /><br />Any questions, ideas and criticisms welcome as well as any tips from people who have played or or run a game this way before. So is anyone interested in this idea?

        <p>Sadly I&#39;m in two PbP atm so I can&#39;t join you, but I&#39;m curious as to what website you plan on using.</p>

        <p>I&#39;ve had a recommendation of <a href="http://myth-weavers.com" class="ot-anchor">myth-weavers.com</a> so I was planning on giving that a go, if that doesn&#39;t work out I would have a look elsewhere. <br /><br />Which ones do you use and what thoughts do you have on them? Are you doing play by post Dungeon World? </p>

        <p>I ran a PbP via G docs and G+. I thought it worked just fine.<br /><br />I&#39;m playing in a game with <a href="http://rpol.net" class="ot-anchor">rpol.net</a>. I&#39;d rather be in G+ and G docs but it&#39;s working alright.<br /><br />Both games are/were DW.</p>

        <p>That&#39;s interesting. Did you do it in just the hangouts chat then or did you make a private community or something? <br /><br />How did you handle rolling?</p>

        <p>For actual play I just created a document and just had everyone pick a different color to type in. Here is our first session <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1MKFg_GGlxWvqyWDBi6krMsI1sKutL-mTJs9_kTQBFJw&amp;authuser=0" class="ot-anchor">https://drive.google.com/open?id=1MKFg_GGlxWvqyWDBi6krMsI1sKutL-mTJs9_kTQBFJw&amp;authuser=0</a><br /><br />I went to a new document for each session. <br /><br />I also made a private community to organize everything and post out of character discussions and character sheets.<br /><br />Dice rolling- They just rolled at home and told me what they got. If they need to cheat to have fun then so be it. As far as I can tell no one ever cheated, or at least didn&#39;t do it much. Based on their rolls I could have killed them if I really wanted to, but I am a generous god.</p>

        <p>Chiming in to say I am interested and also a huge fan of play by post via Google Docs. It&#39;s a great way to have player engagement through use of the chat function. It can also be used effectively for world building and organizing player information.</p>

        <p>Delos how long is one of your sessions? When you play by post do you do it when you are all on together or was that over the course of days etc? <br /><br />Joanne - I&#39;ll drop you an invite to the community when I get home, sounds like you&#39;ve done this before so I&#39;ll be glad to take pointers.</p>

        <p>We rarely played live, together. There were a few times when people would be logged on at the same time, but that was coincidence and not design. &quot;Sessions&quot; lasted about a month or so. It was not a super fast process.</p>

        <p>Excellent you had me worried I was planning it a way what wasn&#39;t going to work then. That is what I was going for when I started planning this.</p>

        <p>I&#39;ve done pbp via Google docs and Google sites and it totally gets the job done, but lately I&#39;ve been toying with the idea of using <a href="http://slack.com" class="ot-anchor">slack.com</a> to run a game. The main appeal is that it has persistent asynchronous chats grouped by channels you make up, so you could maintain a clear narrative throughout the campaign without the potentially messy author color issues you encounter using a document to do it. It also has apps for your various devices to stay synched, and it can import Google drive items. It&#39;s also free. It doesn&#39;t natively handle dice rolls because it&#39;s really designed for collaborative software projects but it does support ad hoc commands and external services so it could be built to support a dice roller if one was so inclined.</p>

        <p>I&#39;ll take a look at slack too then, a lot of ideas today. <br /><br />I&#39;ve got 3 players, so far today already, a couple more should be all I need I reckon, I&#39;m not too sure on what kind of numbers work for play by post. </p>

        <p>3-5 is a good number to start with, but as long as the players are active it can work with almost any number of people! You can also choose to split up party members and have them regroup throughout the adventure if some players are more active than others.</p>

        <p>Oh another thing, go for more players as opposed to less. People will drop out. It happens. If you go for a minimum and someone drops you are now stuck with very few people.</p>

        <p>Count me interested if there are still any spots available? I&#39;m a pbp and Dungeon World novice, and also UK based, so might be slightly misaligned time zone - wise. But if none of that puts you off, I&#39;d like to sign on.</p>
