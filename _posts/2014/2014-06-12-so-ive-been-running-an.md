So, I&#39;ve been running an alternate history game set in the Roman Empire in 69 AD. Dwarves have replaced the Egyptians, Elves represent those of Greek descent (consequently there are a lot of half-elves), and the Halflings are used as the Picts/Celts.<br />In doing so, we&#39;ve been modifying spell lists and such and I&#39;ve been building some custom spell lists for the Celt following Sucellus, the half-Greek follower of Yaweh, and the Egyptian ward of Anubis. I thought I&#39;d share the spells here for anyone who&#39;d care to look at them/use them. Some are based off of trawling through freely available Classes online, so if you see your work or someone else&#39;s please assume it to be me liking your idea enough to borrow. I&#39;ll definitely try to mark the inspirations as I find time (and if I can remember where they came from).

        <p>It sounded interesting until you got to the religious stuff which displayed a painful lack of understanding and would kill a lot of the interest.<br />None of the cultures you chose were monotheistic, so why would you turn them monotheistic? And why would you give your Greeks the god of the Israelis that they had next to nothing to do with. And why would you focus the Egyptians on the death god instead of the sun god? Simply because in modern times everyone in ancient Egypt is dead and you are used to looking at their dead?<br />Well-- in the time that they were alive, they were alive. Anubis wouldn&#39;t be a big thing outside of funerals and the like. </p>

        <p>I don&#39;t think he said the cultures were monotheistic. He just said that the characters had some favorite deities.</p>

        <p>Uh, yeah, the characters chose their deities so I was focusing on the ones they wanted. Nothing posted there said anything was monotheistic, that is totally you assuming the rest of us are ignorant, I guess. It wasn&#39;t a true accounting of the game, just a lead in to the spells... jeez<br />The Half-Greek is from Alexandria and is of the Jewish faith, thus follows Yahweh... the Egyptian example is of a wizard, actually, that wanted to focus on Anubis, Geb, and Osiris in his spells, but he hasn&#39;t come up with any spells yet beyond the Anubis ones due to an outbreak of Lemures.<br />Regardless, they are spells that anyone can use, just file off the names of the gods... I just put them there so the characters knew which spells were theirs.<br />I do thank you, <span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink" href="https://plus.google.com/108052689315378439184" oid="108052689315378439184">andrew ferris</a></span> for letting me know we&#39;re playing the game wrong, though!</p>

        <p>Seriously, <span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink" href="https://plus.google.com/109700226769725851643" oid="109700226769725851643">Joshua Chewning</a></span>, everyone knows that there were no Jewish or Christian people of Greek descent in <b>A.D.</b> 69. All Greeks of that time were automatically polytheists.<br /><br />Duh.</p>

        <p>Well, its your game, not a history course. But i wonder a little how the gonzo old school dnd style would fit in such a setting, its not so easy to file the serials off *~world games.</p>

        <p>Fits fine. I was more hoping for comments on the actual spells rather than a discussion about the setting. I can try to put together a lengthier post about the setting we&#39;re running if that&#39;s what people want.</p>
