<b>The Spear of Serpents</b><br /><i>The Spear of Serpents, forged by the weaponsmith-priests of Madini, never left the Crucible of Steel for use in the dwarfish wars against the lizard men. It waits in the Crucible&#39;s vault for the coming of the Chosen One.</i><br /><br />When <b>you attack a reptilian enemy in melee with the Spear of Serpents</b>, roll+STR. *On a 10+, you deal your damage to the enemy, avoid their attack, and choose 3. At your option, you may also choose to do +1d6 damage but expose yourself to the enemy&#39;s attack. On a 7-9, you deal your damage to the enemy and choose 1, but the enemy makes an attack against you.<br /><br />* Ignore 	the target&#39;s armor.<br />* Inspire 	an ally, granting a +1 forward against reptilian enemies.<br />	* Heal 	1d4 points of damage you&#39;ve suffered.<br />	* Do 	not become more like a 	dwarf in mind or body.<br /><br />When <b>you attack a reptilian enemy at range with the Spear of Serpents</b>, roll+DEX. *On a 10+, you have a clear shot. Deal your damage and choose 2. *On a 7-9, choose 1 from the first list and choose 1 from the second list, and deal your damage.<br /><br /><i>First List</i><br />* You 	have to move to get the shot, placing you in danger as described by 	the GM.<br />	* You 	have to take what you can get: -1d6 damage.<br /><br /><i>Second List</i><br />* Ignore 	the target&#39;s armor.<br />	* The 	Spear of Serpents returns to your hand.<br />	* Do 	not 	become more like a dwarf in mind or body.

        <p>Since it was made to fight reptilian creatures (specifically lizardfolk), I would just make it flat out awesome against them:<br /><br /><b>Ssurak&#39;s Bane</b><br />The bane of lizardfolk and their ilk, when you <b>hold Ssurak&#39;s Bane above your head for them to see</b>, roll+CHA. *On a 10+, some cower or flee, and you and your allies take +1 forward against whoever sticks around. *On a 7-9, they are shaken but stand their ground: take +1 forward against them. *On a miss, they are enraged: you and your allies take -1 forward against them.<br /><br />When you <b>hack and slash a reptilian creature with the Ssurak&#39;s Bane</b>, roll+STR. *On a 10+, deal your damage and choose 3. *On a 7-9, deal your damage and choose 1:<br />*The attack gains piercing 2.<br />*Deal +1d6 damage.<br />*Regain 1d6 hit points.<br />*The creature wracked with pain--you or an ally takes +1 forward against the target.<br /><br />When you hurl Ssurak&#39;s Bane at a reptilian creature, roll+DEX. *On a 10+, choose 2. *On a 7-9, choose 1:<br />*The attack gainst the ignore armor tag.<br />The spear returns to your hand.<br />*The force of the impact knocks them back--the attack gains the forceful tag.</p>
