My buddy Richard and I are working on some support decks for Dungeon World. We are prepping for a Kickstarter we hope to launch in May. I&#39;ve created a blog to let people know of our progress and we&#39;ll have lots of content up there as we go along - including free monsters and art. I&#39;m aiming to post weekly, so we won&#39;t overwhelm your feed stream if you want to follow the blog.

        <p>I am not a fan of &quot;random&quot; encounters in Dungeon World but having handy cards would be useful. </p>

        <p>Agreed! I&#39;ve been using Magic the Gathering Cards for monsters:<br /><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/11lP9N7DNDXewbWiiqunt4z6s4-ajc-Ve5VUeg8Rbu2U/edit?usp=sharing" class="ot-anchor">https://docs.google.com/document/d/11lP9N7DNDXewbWiiqunt4z6s4-ajc-Ve5VUeg8Rbu2U/edit?usp=sharing</a></p>

        <p>I use them mostly to have stuff handy, but when they find an unexpected mine i love that i can quickly grab some cards and populate it. The trap and item decks are proving very useful too.</p>

        <p>Also take a look at PF:Adventure Card Game.  Maybe some inspiration there?</p>

        <p>I&#39;ve been looking at that game, a couple friends have it and we have it slated for an upcoming game night. I&#39;m not trying to make a whole game, but a tool that will work with DW (and its spin-offs) and possibly other narrative fantasy games. I&#39;m also doing trap and useful item decks (for starters) which I&#39;m hoping to make system agnostic by providing a quick system conversion guide. These are for the two things my gamers do all the time - go off the beaten path and end up in danger (a quick trap is a great dramatic element to throw in, I&#39;ve even done so in the middle of a combat which led to the discovery of a whole level of the dungeon that I wasn&#39;t even planning!) and ask me &quot;what here is useful to me?&quot; Useful items are everything from levers to brooms! And each card will be illustrated and have snippits of fiction attached to them. This past Friday my party has been all spread out, so I decided to jump into some action and have the group tell the story of how they got there, to spice it up I gave them each a random item that they wove into the story of trying to entertain a village of kobolds and things going sideways. So much fun. </p>
