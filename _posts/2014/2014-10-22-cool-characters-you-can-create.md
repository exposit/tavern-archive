<b>Cool characters you can create with Class Warfare</b><br /><br />#1 The Dragon Pilgrim/Sarkhan Vol <br /><br />You start out as a Disciple with the <b>Pilgrim</b> and <b>Venerator</b> specialties and take <b>Monstrous Heritage (Dragon)</b> from the Adventurer. <br />You are a half/quarter/semi/dragontouched/whatever Dragon-Human. The empire of dragons has fallen long ago and you travel to their different strongholds to plunder and explore them. <br />Your dragon heritage moves could be <br />Breath Fire<br />Fly with dragon wings<br />Sniff out Gold <br />for example, with your Spells coming from the Battle, Judgement or Revelation domain, depending on how you think the ancient dragon gods are. <br />Taking up a Multiclass into Bard for Bardic Lore of Dragons further pushes hard into that theme and will make sure that Dragons are a big part of your campaign. <br /><br />#2 NotADemonWarlock Dervish <br />You are a Master Fighter, using demon weapons against everyone standing in your way. You take <b>Wielder</b> and <b>Battledancer</b> from the Warrior. Your signature weapon is a pair of knifes, connected by a chain that can burn with the fires of hell. After a command the knifes and chain transform into a spiked chain type weapon THAT IS ALSO ON FIRE. So more fire? Take the <b>Firestarter</b> specialty from the Rogues so you can control your demonfire! <br />This would be even cooler with a Halfling but you need to be a Human so you can pick up the <i>precise</i> enchantement so you can focus on DEX and INT. Multiclassing into Duelist is an obvious choice to make you an even more deadly tornado of fiery blade-death. <br /><br />#3 The not so legitimate businessman. <br />You are a <b>Shopkeeper</b> and *Householder*. Your Household is the local thief guild, the Shop is just a front. To compliment that you may take <b>Fence</b> or <b>Breaker</b> or <b>Swindler</b> or <b>Mastermind</b>, it&#39;s really up to you. Might also depend on the other characters in the group. Perfect for an Urban game. <br /><br />#4 Monster Hunter - as in the game <br />For this you take <b>Arminger</b> and <b>Sharpshooter</b>. Only taking 2 specialties allows you to start with the ability to turn your prey into gear. I imagine this as someone really well armored and shooting the biggest gun or bow they can find before they just punch their prey to death with a spiked gauntlet. If you can talk your GM into a Gunlance (+1 damage, reach, near, reload) - even better. <br /><br />#5 The Oracle <br />There are a few nice ways you can go with this archetype. You can start with <b>Oracle</b>. To compliment this you could take a Divine Caster and the <i>Revelation</i> domain. From there take either <b>Sage</b> or <b>Bard</b> to just KNOW things or <b>Soothsayer</b> to have more control over the future.<br />If you don&#39;t want to be linked to the Divine you start with <b>Soothsayer</b> and take <b>Arcane Ritualist</b> for the Scrying Move and a Arcane Caster for the <i>Divination</i> school. No matter how you go, you can multiclass between these to pick up extra options you want to have. <br />Beware your power though - the future might be bleak.

        <p>It is basicaly a new way to create characters for Dungeon World by <span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink" href="https://plus.google.com/113864117304127544117" oid="113864117304127544117">Johnstone Metzger</a></span>. You choose 1 archetype and up to 3 specialties from the archetype to create your character, your starting moves and the moves you will have access to. Imagine you could play a ranger but without an animal companion and will urban tracking instead of nature stuff. It also has a lot of support for subtypes of casters and a bunch of new spells.  </p>

I was also a little disappointed that I couldn&#39;t find the Druid&#39;s shapeshift move.</p>

        <p><span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink" href="https://plus.google.com/113692337653837882568" oid="113692337653837882568">Peter Johansen</a></span> The problem with the Druid is that she&#39;s almost completely built around one thing: shapeshifting. So If ound it hard to break that down into 3 specialties while I was writing the book. I was thinking of doing a special Druid archetype, where you&#39;d start with a nature-themed base and swap out various typical druid-y powers like nature magic, shapeshifting, etc. I would probably do something similar to that for a D&amp;D-style Warlock class, too.<br /><br />Having thought about it a bit since finishing CW, though, I think Tim is on the right track. A properly-balanced shapeshifting move that is one-third of your starting moves lets you change into just one other form (maybe 2 if you&#39;re a werewolf or something), while having multiple forms is an advanced move. In that sense, the Druid could be considered a character with 2 specialties and an advanced move from one of them (I got the idea for that option from Inverse World&#39;s Mechanic, actually).<br /><br />So yeah, in hindsight, I probably could have included that, but now I guess there&#39;s some opportunity for a supplement if anyone else wants to take a crack at it.</p>

        <p>As to freestyle casting, I think different styles are awesome, but the main problem with supernatural powers is limiting them in scope so you have a specific <i>thing</i> that you do and not like &quot;you can do anything.&quot; Limiting magic with keywords like the Mage&#39;s spell focus is cool. When I did that with my Elementalist, though, I tried to give stricter direction for the effect and not just the element. But I think there is room in DW for both different types of spell lists and supernatural powers as move, as well as different types of magical spellcasting abilities.</p>
