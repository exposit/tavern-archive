Hey everyone! My new class is coming along fabulously! I&#39;m really excited to finally release it, but I was just wondering if anyone could help me concerning illusions. I&#39;m assuming there already are existing mechanics for illusions, but how exactly do they work? Do they have health? Do they do damage? Can they cast certain spells? Thanks! :)

        <p>There aren&#39;t any official or accepted mechanics for illusions. <br />Otherwise i would proceed like this,<br /><br />ask yourself <br /><br />Do illusions dissipate when attacked? Do they have a certain stability? <br /><br />How can someone be hurt by an illusion? Do ilussions have a mental component that creates the pain? <br /><br />Most rules you give to them should make logical sense with themselves and in the fiction. For example i can&#39;t see how an illusion would cast a spell. </p>

        <p>This was exactly my line of thinking. Just wanted to see if there weren&#39;t maybe some default mechanics for Illusions. Thank you very much for the help!</p>

        <p>The most useful thing to look at is probably the Mirror Image spell. </p>

        <p>Isn&#39;t that more of a defensive spell though? Using the image to take the damage intended for yourself?</p>

        <p>Yes. But it shows that &quot;normal&quot; illusions probably don&#39;t have &quot;hitpoints&quot; (as they shouldn&#39;t have in my opinion)</p>

        <p>I see your point. I&#39;ll play around with it a bit more for now, but I&#39;ll keep that in mind. Thanks again.</p>

        <p>I dont see how an illusion can cause physical effects unless you combo it with something else. For instance illusion + magic missile.</p>

        <p>Maybe consider using a &quot;hold&quot; mechanic for trickery-based illusions.  Like:<br /><b>Minor Image</b> (illusion, ongoing): You create an illusion of a person or thing, not much larger than a man. It looks and sounds real, but anyone touching will realize there&#39;s nothing to it.  Hold 3. Spend your hold to have the illusion react to events in a realistic way (holding up a conversation, pretending to deflect an arrow with its shield, etc.).  When you run out of hold, the illusion ends (or gives itself away).</p>

        <p>I guess you&#39;re right, I&#39;ll probably end up doing something like that, so that the illusion can at least carry some weight, and not just be a useless image standing in the corner.</p>

        <p>but then it is a magical construct isn&#39;t it? </p>

        <p>The way I ultimately decided to make this mechanic was that it does in fact have health, but takes double damage, and cannot deal any damage. It is supposed to be used more as a mobile &quot;eye&quot; for vision or to distract guards, than it is to be used as a combat tool.</p>

        <p>I know this goes against what you guys are saying, but based on the theme I chose for this class it fits much better.</p>

        <p>Or a &quot;drone&quot; you can send into a dark scary ass tunnel. Or a distraction for infiltration purpose (hence the use of HP)</p>

        <p>I think purely for ease of use this thing just having &quot;1 HP&quot; (so when it is hit it dies) should help with bookkeeping at the table. <br />Looking at fiction such things mostly just get killed by whatever happens to them. When an enemy engages them they are distracted by definition. </p>

        <p>I see what you&#39;re saying. Maybe giving it a chance to defy danger with the use of your stats, would give it more survivability. But I what you&#39;re saying does make a lot of sense. Coordination, and keeping up with the fiction, would pose multiple problems, if I gave it a certain amount of health.</p>
