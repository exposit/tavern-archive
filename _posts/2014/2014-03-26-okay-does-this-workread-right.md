Okay does this work/read right <br />Shield of the Unifier 				+1 Armour, 1 weight<br /><br />The first King of men bore this shield, helping him unify the land against the dragons of old. <br /><br />When ever you give orders to a Human NPC and have this shield,  it can always considered leverage for parley, and you take +1 forward.<br /><br />When recruiting and you have The shield of the Unifier take additional +1.

        <p>While you <b>bear the shield</b>, any human hirelings you command take +1 Loyalty. In addition, you take +1 armor against dragons.<br /><br />When you <b>rally humans into action</b>, you take +1 forward.<br /><br />If you ever flee from a dragon, human hirelings you command take -1 Loyalty, you lose the shields bonus to armor, and its weight increases to 5 until you redeem yourself.</p>

        <p>Hi! If I may I suggest this course of action when crafting magic items: drop entirely stuff like +1 to things like in D&amp;D; instead, give the magic item awesome powers related to <del>its</del> <b><i>your</i></b> story.<br /><br />You can use the shield to protect you and whoever is behind you from any attack by a dragon (or even from dragon-related magic); when you bear the shield you and your allies never have fear; if the bearer falls in battle and is burned while laying on the shield, his spirit joins those of the kings inhabiting the shield waiting for the ultimate battle at the end of time to come out and fight; during midday, under direct sunlight, you can glimpse a vision reflected on the shield about what&#39;s doing the most powerful human king, while during midnight, under direct moonlight, you could see a brief image about what&#39;s doing the most dangerous dragon alive; the clashing sound of a blade against the shield is particularly irritating to dragons, who will either flee or attack the bearer when he does so.</p>

I think that a magic sword that just gets a minor bonus to damage is boring, but when used properly can give the item a good mechanical punch that supports the fiction.<br /><br /><span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink" href="https://plus.google.com/113216218054693085901" oid="113216218054693085901">James Chambers</a></span> wanted a shield that helped a king unify men against dragons. The shield you pitched does some other stuff, just not that.<br /><br />Granted my pitch did more than what was bargained for, too, as I was trying to make it more flexible and draw from what James had said.<br /><br />If I wanted to stick <i>entirely</i> to the flavor, I would do this:<br /><br />When a dragon attacks a steading, while you bear the shield you can rally and command any human that sees the shield. They will always follow your orders as best they can, and neither you nor them will flee from the dragon unless you want to.<br /><br />You could still include the bit about the shield no longer working if you <i>do</i> flee.<br /><br />That lets you rally humans against dragons, and is situational enough to not cause problems.<br /><br />However, he included a loyalty bonus, so maybe the shield is a general leadership icon. In that case I would not want you to just be able to get hirelings willy-nilly and boss them around without any drawbacks, so I kept the bonus.</p>

        <p>Whatever works for you buddy! Mine was merely a suggestion :) but I&#39;ll explain myself: I (usually) find +stuff items boring. Like, we dealt with lots of magic swords in my most recent campaign, but we didn&#39;t even think about bonuses or whatnot. One raised the victims as undead (cause there were necromancers involved), one made you amphibious (when approaching a submerged city), another opened portals to other planes (the paladin was part of the planar police)... When crafting magic items, we usually center their powers on what that particular game&#39;s story is about. In other words: if we have to invest time in statting an item, we couldn&#39;t care less about making certain options more powerful; we give them crazy awesome powers that drive the story forward and that seems something that actually pays for the time invested.</p>

        <p>I love mechanical +&#39;s that support and enable great fiction. Moves that are 100% fictional probably don&#39;t need to be moves at all...<br />;-)</p>
