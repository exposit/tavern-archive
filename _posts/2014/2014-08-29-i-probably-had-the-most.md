I probably had the most random Dungeon World session ever, things were going ok I had a group of people and they were following this group of people through the city. I asked a few questions about what was i nthe shops and in the city and I got kind of silly answers like Talking Mosquitos so ok this is going to be a bit silly, so I created cultists that lured the players in with Fish and Chips. Then a random came in that someone knew and was playing around being a pebble and then they stopped going for the group of people they were following and I was like ah what do I do so I asked what do they want to do...well they want to talk to dancing monkeys and the talking mosquito and stuff and I just broke as a GM I was like...ehhhhh what do I do! But thankfully the player came in and brought it back on track and they went to the factory district and then some politicians came in and they had a shouting match with them. And then they went and the players started going against each other I was trying my hardest for them to care about a plot or something happening but nope so I just went screw it lets just have randomness of them floating towards space then coming down on a deserted island with zombies and again a lot of craziness...I had to end it so I just thought well it was all on the Holodeck on the Starship Enterprise. I will say I wasn&#39;t the best I was at GMing but also the players had no interest in any of the plot hooks I was trying to put in.

        <p>Why does the phrase, &quot;plot hooks I was trying to put in&quot; bother me? <br />Though, your situation sounds like one of those dreaded &quot;let&#39;s have a talk about what we want out of this game&quot; moments.  That, or &quot;wait, wait, talking mosquitoes? Wizard, weren&#39;t those destroyed 100 years ago, WTF does their return mean: the first sign of the end days, or the last sign before the swamp hordes invade?&quot;<br />Sorry about your troubles, I just wish I had a group!</p>
