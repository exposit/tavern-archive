What kinds of effects do people use when a druid, in an animal form, poisons someone?  As a rattlesnake in a recent game my GM had me just deal my class damage without damage reduction from armor, but we agreed that it wasn&#39;t the most exciting or narratively compelling result.  There are a few poison examples from the thief class, but I&#39;m curious what other poison effects people are using in their games.

        <p>I&#39;ve had a foe just keel over and die due to a bite from a Druid in snake form. But the snake form in question was incredibly venomous.<br /><br />Depending on how dangerous the snake is I&#39;d say whoever gets bitten is probably out of action. They might not be dead, but they&#39;re probably dying, or at the very least on the floor writhing in agony. Damage in addition to the venom&#39;s effect might be appropriate, depending on what the venom actually does.<br /><br />Of course that all assumes you&#39;re dealing with a human sized living target. Snake bites will have less effect on bigger creatures. Like an Ogre or a Giant might just get sick and shaky from a bite instead of dropping.</p>

        <p>We had a harpy get poisoned by a druid as  water moccasin, then she got hit by some sleeping poison from the thief and ended up falling into the ocean because she couldn&#39;t continue flying between the two poisons. Drowned horribly, it was fun. </p>

        <p>Well they are poisoned now. It&#39;s the same as a character getting bitten by the same snake. Describe what happens to them. <br />Maybe ask the Druid what the effects of that poison are.</p>
