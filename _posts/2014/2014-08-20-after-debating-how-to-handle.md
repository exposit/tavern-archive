After debating how to handle space stuff in OortWorlds, I decided Space Compendium Classes integrate best -- each player selects one compendium class.<br /><br />The two I have so far: (Sorry about formatting)<br /><br />Gunner<br />A gunner is skilled at operating large weapon systems. In some cases, gunnery officers can also operate drones and direct missiles with great skill.<br />Trained Volley<br />A Gunner may use Wis or Int to make Volleys using ship weapons.<br />System Training<br />Pick Far, 1 piercing, or a technological tag within your technological familiarity. Within minutes of taking control of a weapon system, you can add that tag to the system. The tag only applies while you are using the weapon.<br />Disabling Volley<br />Once per target you can choose to make a careful attack to disrupt a ship.<br />✴ On a 10+, choose two. ✴ On a 7-9, choose one:<br />Reduce their armor by 1 until they repair it.<br />Either propulsion or weapons is knocked out until repaired.<br />You create an advantage; +1 forward to anyone acting on it.<br />You deal your damage +1d6. <br />Drone Guidance<br />Your training in operating remote devices extends to drones; you may act through drones with no penalty.<br />Drones essentially act like a breakable version of yourself.<br /> <br />When you gain a level from 2-5, you may also choose from these moves:<br />Hot mod<br />During Make Camp, you may add Far, 1 piercing, or any technological tag you are familiar with to a ship weapon system, in addition to the benefit of System Training. You can do this every time you Make Camp, but only one Hot Mod can be applied to a given system, and only you may make use of it.<br />Two gunners may share a Hot Mod on a weapon system.<br />When you gain a level from 6-10, you may also choose from these moves:<br />Gunnery Master<br />When firing from a ship, use your class’ damage rating if it is higher than the weapon’s rating.<br />Gear<br />You have a standard space suit and com.<br /> <br />Marine<br />Marines are trained in boarding enemy vessels and disabling forces within. You are also trained in repelling boarders, though it is not your primary training.<br />Starting Moves<br />Bracing<br />When you make the Volley move with a weapon that has recoil in low acceleration or freefall, you may make a point of bracing against a surface. If footing isn’t very good, you have a -1 to Volley.<br />Breaching<br />You may use a breaching device to quickly punch a hole through a wall or bulkhead, roll+Int or roll+Str, your choice. If the barrier is armored, subtract armor from the roll.<br />You can also breach through a ship hull, so long as there is a corridor or other space within 20 cm of the hull surface. Armor subtracts from roll. There is an additional -2 to the roll unless you make an additional Discern Realities or other preparatory move to pick an appropriate location or to assist in the attempt.<br />✴On a 10+, hull breached and choose 3. ✴On a 7-9, hull breached and choose 2.<br />It doesn’t take a very long time<br />No significant system damage<br />Enemy is not alerted<br />You can easily recover the breaching kit (though this may vent the chamber)<br />EVA<br />You are trained in operations outside of ships or habitats, able to use security features and deal with risky EVA situations without panicking.<br />Tumble Combat<br />You can ignore the effects of moderate shifts in acceleration, such as a maneuvering ship. Against someone without this training, you have a +1 for physical conflicts (melee or ranged).<br />When you gain a level from 2-5, you may also choose from these moves:<br />Bearings<br />When you first board a ship or habitat you’ve never encountered, you can ask the GM one question about layout or critical systems.<br />Defender<br />When your ship or habitat is boarded, you can ask the GM one question about the enemy’s position or identity, possibly basic capabilities.<br />Gear<br />You have an EVA-ready space suit, capable of moving reasonably quickly in freefall, and a modular com (which can be attached to a space suit, attached by strap or belt otherwise).<br />You have a breaching kit (3 weight)
