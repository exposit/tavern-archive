Anybody done any additional info on the hireling rules? Maybe suggested coin costs?

        <p>Here is some stuff I pooled together:  <a href="http://www.dungeonworldexplorer.com/hirelings.html" class="ot-anchor">http://www.dungeonworldexplorer.com/hirelings.html</a></p>

        <p>I know there is a 3rd party pdf with a total-replacement hack for handling minions, but my memory is being no help about where I read it.  Re: coin costs, you have seen p330, right? 20 to 60 a day for hazard pay, down to 30 a month for army-pay, which I assume is mostly boring garrison and drill with only occasional terror and bloodspray.  the non-monetary costs of p37 are fun ways to make npcs&#39; personalities matter, to avoid the hench-management of your players reducing to dull spreadsheet-itis.</p>

        <p>I love Pirate World&#39;s system of giving NPCs two stats—loyalty and injuries—plus their own moves and damage dice like monsters. It makes them feel a bit thicker than the default list of skills, without being unmanageable.</p>

The equipment section has the army pay that you mention, and I had seen that, but I don&#39;t see the hazard pay that you have. I&#39;m good on non-monetary costs, I just wondered for people who are looking for coin. <br /><br />I should mention that the reason I am asking this is that I am trying to start up a game based on my old Pool of Radiance sourcebook. Part of the conceit is that there is a big mob of NPCs available for hire in the base town, as well as rivals and whatnot. I&#39;d like to tie asking prices to skill levels, and have the party negotiate from there.</p>

        <p>Just straight up make something up, its always the best way. Its only for you and your friends to play anyway, right? If I was going to make up a system for it, I might consider something like this:<br /><br />When a hireling works for pay rather than glory or revenge...<br />...if they are a seasoned professional, add 5 coins per year spent adventuring.<br />...if they have a natural talent, great skill or they&#39;re strong, add 5 coins.<br />...if they know the area you&#39;re headed, add 5 coins.<br />...if they think they&#39;re better than the heroes, add 2 coins.<br />...if they have a stake in the mission, take between 1 and 5 coins depending on urgency.<br />...if they admire one of the heroes, take 2 coins.<br />...if they are an outlaw or criminal, take 2 coins.<br />...when they take a beating or take part in a failed mission, add between 1 and 5 coins.<br />...when you lied about where you were headed or what could happen, add 10 coins.<br />...when they find something great for themselves, literally or figuratively, take 10 coins.<br /><br />Hows that?</p>
