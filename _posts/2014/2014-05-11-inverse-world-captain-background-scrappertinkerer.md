<b>Inverse World Captain Background</b><br /><br />Scrapper/Tinkerer <br />Your ship has a special ability or maneuver that you engineered. You can activate it easily but mark half a stress box if you do. <br /><br />Anyone has an idea for a Mercenary Background?

        <p>Maybe a lesser version of the Spoils of War move? When you capture a valuable treasure, ship, or wealthy person, gain 1 Trade. <br /><br />The Pirate background is pretty good too. It depends on the context of what you consider to be a mercenary.</p>

        <p>I think i want something that triggers on when you add someone new to the ship. Now idea what would happen though. </p>
