I had an idea for a onshot/con game I&#39;d like to share.<br /><br />The players get a specialized playbook which are not classes but legendary magical weapons. I&#39;d take moves from many different classes to construct each weapon by a theme, e.g. the Blood Sword will have fighter moves, a holy sword with cleric and paladin moves, and so on.<br /><br />Each time a players mark xp, he get to choose a new move right away at the table, symboling his character getting more power from the weapon.<br /><br />I&#39;d also replace alignment with drive moves are let them mark xp for them during play. Those drives will be the weapon&#39;s, not the player.<br /><br />What&#39;d you think?

        <p>I like it, it feels very flexible.<br /><br />Makes me think of the animated Wakfu series.  Paladins get all their power from their weapons, which are actually just trapped demons.  If the paladins aren&#39;t vigilant and virtuous, the demons take them over and possess them.</p>

        <p>If you&#39;re going for something over the top this sounds like it might be a fun way to achieve it.</p>
