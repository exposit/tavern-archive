Hey guys! We had a player for our AW campaign drop out on us before we started our campaign, so I am now frantically searching for someone to fill the role. Anyone here interested? :) Details below!<br /><br />Game: Apocalypse World<br />Campaign Length: 4-6 sessions (variable)<br />Frequency: Biweekly<br />First session: 4:00PM EDT, Saturday July 12, 2014<br />Other: This will be streamed live on my Twitch channel, so a webcam is preferable!<br /><br />If there are other questions, please let me know!

        <p>As I&#39;m fairly new, I&#39;m only using vanilla plus some of the limited playbooks that aren&#39;t completely rule changing (Maestro&#39;D, Faceless, Hoarder, and Touchstone). I&#39;m not opposed to more, but I&#39;d want to see them beforehand just so I can understand how they&#39;ll fit in. :) Does that suit you?</p>

        <p>I was actually asking if other people knew what they were playing yet. But yeah that&#39;s fine, I&#39;m pretty new to AW myself and was probably going to go vanilla.</p>

        <p>Oh! I&#39;m sorry. Yeah we&#39;ve got someone who is deciding between maestro&#39;d and savvyhead, and one character who is going gunlugger. The one who is currently a maybe for this session is thinking chopper, but we&#39;re not sure if he&#39;ll join in this session, or we&#39;ll drop him into the next.<br /><br />If you&#39;re good for the date/time above (we are dedicating four hours to the session, with 30 minutes before that for prep), add me to your circle on G+ and I&#39;ll send you the link to the Roll20.<br /><br />No worries about being new. I&#39;ve watched a lot of sessions, but never played any. Two of our players seem fairly knowledgeable, and one is brand new to it all. So it&#39;s a mixed bag, but I think should prove to be a lot of fun.</p>

        <p>Alright, you&#39;re added. I&#39;ll work on digging out my old webcam. <br /><br />And I&#39;m not completely new, I&#39;ve run about two sessions, just never played. So this side of things is pretty new to me.</p>
