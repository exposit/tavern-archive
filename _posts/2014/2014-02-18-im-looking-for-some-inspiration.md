I&#39;m looking for some inspiration here. Our subject today is a warrior that uses magic which revolves around law, justice and truth... what moves or effects might you expect him to have?

        <p>We call that a &quot;Paladin&quot;.</p>

        <p>Protector style may be the paladin archetype.  Offensive style may be similar to the 4e Avenger, which was a good class for a lot of baseline martial with some cool supernatural thrown in.   <br />If you want a name, reuse some of the other ones over the years, like justiciar.</p>

        <p>Yeah you&#39;re describing the Paladin so far.  Are there differentiation you&#39;re specifically looking for?</p>

        <p>Hm...headlocks, limb locks, magic handcuffs, magic cage. <br />&quot;Tell Me The Truth&quot; spell.<br />Spout Lore on local rules and regulations.<br />Something to do with Lady Liberty. Scales/Balance of Justice.<br />&quot;Justice never sleeps&quot; condition.<br />Thats all I can think of.</p>

        <p>Thanks, Tony. That is the sort of thing I&#39;m looking for. :)<br /><br />But yeah, I am reskinning the paladin playbook to something more akin to a police officer with &quot;law-related&quot; magic. So far, the change has only been skin deep so I thought I&#39;d change some moves and add a few others to keep the theme going stronger.<br /><br />I might keep Lay On Hands... or change it to something similar to the druid&#39;s balance move. I have a move called Bound By Law that restricts a single creature&#39;s movement. Another move called Judgement that allows the paladin to deal extra damage to a target from a distance if he knows their specific crime. I have a bonus to law-related spouting as a background as well as one for lie detecting/clue finding.</p>

        <p>I was thinking of making a Sherlock Holmes Class with the Ranger&#39;s Hunt and Track Move, save its for tracking people down in cities. Never got around to it.<br /><br />Also: the Apocalypse World&#39;s operative has this move where people come to you wanting you to help them... I don&#39;t have it in front of me, but basically why not have a move where townsfolk ask you to catch a criminal and in return they pay you depending on how high you roll.</p>

        <p>Those are some cool ideas, guys. :) Thanks.<br /><br />Now I&#39;m thinking that Paladin might not fit after all of these moves are implemented. Maybe justicar? I don&#39;t eve know what that is, but I&#39;ve seen the word used before. Time for some Google-fu.</p>
