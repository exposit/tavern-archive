For a character that knows what they&#39;re doing when they&#39;re playing with gunpowder.<br /><br />DEMOLITIONS EXPERT<br /><br />When you ponder on how to accomplish something with explosives, Roll 2d6 + Wis. On a 10+, ask the GM 2 questions from the list. On a 7-9, ask only 1.<br /><br />Either way, take +1 forward acting on the answers.<br /><br />*Exactly where should I place explosives to get the effect I want?<br />*What unintended consequences should I expect if I use explosives here?<br />*What would be a reasonable alternative to achieve the same effect without explosives?
