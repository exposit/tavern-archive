        <p>well, since you&#39;re on G+, that means you have a gmail account, which means you have a google Drive (which is cloud storage like dropbox and others) Drive is free, and a lot of folks use that to post up stuff. So you can upload your document straight away.</p>

        <p>One of the nice things about Google Drive is that if you post the public share link into Google+, it will create a little thumbnail here.<br /><br />Tip: Google Drive wants to convert Word documents to Google Doc; doing so will trash formatting on any but the most simple files. I recommend exporting a PDF and uploading that. If you&#39;d rather not, when you upload it to Drive, clear the checkbox to covert it to a Google Drive format.</p>

        <p>Googling &#39;Dropbox&#39; offers an alternative as well.</p>
