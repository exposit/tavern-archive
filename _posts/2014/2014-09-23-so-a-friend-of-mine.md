So a friend of mine and I are thinking about trying to put together a Space Opera focused hack of Dungeon World. We&#39;re starting off by putting together some core playbooks, we have an idea of what kinds we want to make but we&#39;re having a hard time putting together a coherent set of moves that differentiates each class. Does anybody have any advice on how to build balanced character classes and make good move sets for them?

        <p>Yeah, that isn&#39;t really  the style we&#39;re going for, that&#39;s more Flash Gordon style planetary romance, we&#39;re going for more Star Wars/Lensman style space opera.</p>

        <p>What kinds of classes/playbooks are you going to use?</p>

        <p>We&#39;ve tentatively come up with 8:<br />The SPACE NOMAD - inspired by the Mandalorians from KOTOR, based around the idea of having an honor code (that might be twisted) and following it<br />The FREETRADER- A charismatic &quot;face&quot; type that is based around having a network of contacts and broad cultural familiarity<br />The MASTER TECH - The classic engineer, based around coming up with awesome gadgets and an upgradeable robot sidekick<br />The SCIENTIST - A knowledge based class, you can pick from a list of disciplines to be versed in and get situational bonuses<br />The SPACE MARINE - Heavy combat class based around being able to use any weapon to maximum effect.<br />The FRINGER - A scoundrel-type character based around scavenging useful stuff from old junk and making due without, also good at bargaining<br />The COLONIST - A wilderness focused character that is based around being able to adapt to alien environments and survive in harsh conditions<br />The INITIATE - A toned-down Jedi/Lensman class, based around secret training giving them special physical and mental abilities just short of telekinesis and telepathy.</p>

        <p>These are cool, a lot of them are pretty similar to what I we were thinking about. I particularly like the way you did the Psi-Adept.</p>

Maybe two - one for the big brutish/monstrous type, and one for the enlightened/evolved type<br /><br />As for making moves, the easiest way to do this for me is to come up with a list of archetypes, then do a bullet point list of cliches or tropes underneath each one. This tells me what sorts of things need moves for the character; what the highlights I have to hit are. For me, the most important part of a move is making the name evocative - once I have that the mechanics can be made to fit, but often the name tells me more about how the character should play than the mechanics do</p>

        <p>Yeah, we saw that and were planning on trying it out Sunday morning but we were just a little too far back in the line. It looks very cool though, we&#39;re thinking about trying it out with our regular group.</p>
