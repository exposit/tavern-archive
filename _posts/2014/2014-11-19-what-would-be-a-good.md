What would be a good benefit for a Half Elven Wizard? What about a Dragonborn Druid? I was thinking for a Druid to be able to shapechange into a dragon was pretty cool.

        <p>Dragonborn Druid - all your animal forms have the breath weapon you have.</p>

        <p>Half Elven wizard? Have sex with you always counts as leverage for parley with humans or elves. :D</p>

        <p>Cleric&#39;s Detect Alignment as a cantrip is the obvious midpoint between Elf and Human moves for Wizard. Gives you information, which jibes with Detect Magic, and is not one of the things I&#39;d usually pick up with a Human Wizard, so might be mildly balanced.<br /><br />Could just go &#39;pick the Elf or Human move, your choice&#39;, though.</p>

        <p>Half Elven move for Wizards: You learned a variety of tricks during your travels. Once per game session, you can lose a prepared spell to cast a spell of lower level.<br /><br />Dragonborn move for Druids: Hold 4 instead of 3 when you shift into a reptile.</p>

        <p>For the dragonborn druid you could approach it like elf druids:<br />The Great Fire forever burns in your heart. In addition to any other attunements the Dragon Wastes are always considered your lands.</p>

        <p>Is there suggestion/charm person as a spell on DW? Would be good as HE cantrip.</p>

        <p>Not as such, at least in the base game.<br /><br />Gain a bard move: Either &#39;Bardic Lore&#39; or &#39;Charming and Open&#39;... might be interesting, though.</p>

        <p>Usually race moves are less powerful than standard ones. You could draw inspiration from those, however.</p>

        <p>I think with the wizard character and backstory it would make sense they would have bardic lore since there family taught them everything and they were very knowledgeable</p>

        <p>Would need to be 1 really limited set of lore though.</p>

        <p>Why? I do&#39;t think it breaks the game to much for the wizard to have that kind of move I found that my bard layers never really used it since the differet things you could choose were limited. Plus there isn&#39;t another bard in this group</p>
