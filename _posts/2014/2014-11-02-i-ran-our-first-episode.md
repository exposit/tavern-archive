I ran our first episode of <span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink" href="https://plus.google.com/113864117304127544117" oid="113864117304127544117">Johnstone Metzger</a></span>&#39;s Space Wurm vs. Moonicorn last night.  It was awesome, you should try it!<br /><br />A little write up / scene breakdown of our session is here: <a href="http://goo.gl/PvDuuZ" class="ot-anchor">http://goo.gl/PvDuuZ</a><br /><br />I did find myself with a bit of a puzzle when it came to what to prepare for the first session.  I wonder if a little bit of additional, SWvMC specific, guidance would be a good addition to the adventure.<br /><br />DW tends to suggest not even thinking about fronts for a first session, and instead think about asking questions an leaving blanks, etc.<br /><br />But with Space Wurm vs. Moonicorn, you know what the fronts are as soon as Space Wurm makes a few decisions, and Space Wurm knows they have to defeat those fronts to win the game, and to be fair to Moonicorn, if you don&#39;t push the fact that they are hunted then Space Wurm might get more chances to face their dangers than Moonicorn does which wouldn&#39;t be fair.<br /><br />I ended up splitting the difference; I used the planet generating rules from Dungeon Planet and the steading Rules from DW to generate a situation with lots of tensions in it that reference and introduce the fronts and foreshadow some dangers, but didn&#39;t really provide a lot of opportunity to face them directly.  <br /><br />The approach seemed to work pretty good, and now that all the characters have met each other, and the players have a sense of what is going on, I can see them already start to plot how to move themselves towards their goals.<br /><br />Has anyone else played it? What did or would you do to prepare for the first session?<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" class="ot-hashtag" href="https://plus.google.com/s/%23SpaceWurmvsMoonicorn/posts">#SpaceWurmvsMoonicorn</a><br />  <a rel="nofollow" class="ot-hashtag" href="https://plus.google.com/s/%23SpaceWurm/posts">#SpaceWurm</a>   <a rel="nofollow" class="ot-hashtag" href="https://plus.google.com/s/%23Moonicorn/posts">#Moonicorn</a>

        <p>Thanks Rob! You are right about the fronts chapter, I think &quot;a little bit of additional&quot; is being generous. It&#39;s a half-assed first draft. Ideally, the finished version will be about 5-6 times as long and have full dangers and multiple questions list for all 7 fronts.<br /><br />Right now I&#39;m slowly working on the quick play one-shot rules, in the hopes that will encourage more playtesting.</p>

        <p>The world-building required definitely adds a paperwork hurdle to keep track of all the things before the game can get off the ground, but so far it&#39;s feeling worth it.<br /><br />Another thing I&#39;ve noticed, going through the character sheets we cobbled together is that for Space Wurm and the Mogul&#39;s gear sections both essentially say &quot;Have whatever you want&quot;; in practice this ended up being &quot;start with nothing and we&#39;ll figure it out later&quot;.  I think it would be useful to see some options like the Space Bard&#39;s all black with sunglasses, even at night, or the other&#39;s Otherwordly gems-- really just another  cool list of neat stuff to spark imaginations.</p>

        <p>The Other has a maximum Alienation of +3.  Is there a maximum Integrity that Moonicorn can have?</p>

        <p>No max. Ideally, Moonicorn wants to spend Integrity more often than there are opportunities to gain it back, thus leading to hard choices.</p>
