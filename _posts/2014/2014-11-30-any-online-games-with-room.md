Any online games with room for another player? Preferably a weekend game, but I&#39;m also available during the week, if it&#39;s later at night (after 10pm cst).<br /><br />I&#39;ve been reading up on Dungeon World for a while now and am excited to try it out.

        <p>Would you be up for a Star Wars version of Dungeon World?  We play Saturday nights from 10:30pm PST to 1:30am PST and we are looking for more players interested in a long term campaign.  All of the current characters were made using Jarrah James&#39; Stellar Conflict playbooks, but any playbook is welcome if you can flavor it as Star Wars.  If you are interested I can send you more information.<br /><br />We play over Roll20, but don&#39;t use Hangouts.</p>

        <p>Sounds interesting, never thought of doing Star Wars in DW but it makes sense. Send me whatever info you have, I&#39;ll give it a shot.</p>
