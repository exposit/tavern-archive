One of my players wants to play a weaponsmith, so I&#39;ve been trying to come up with moves that will hopefully eventually be a complete class, or at least a compendium. The central move I&#39;ve been working on is intended to create powerful magical weapons. I&#39;ve been tweaking it for a bit, trying to decide if I like it better than some of the existing magical-item enchanting moves. I would be grateful for any critiques you can offer:<br /><br /><b>Art of the Forge</b><br />When you <i>use a source of power to imbue a weapon you are forging,</i> explain how the source creates the effect and what the weapon move and trigger will be, then roll +XP spent. On a 10+, it comes to pass as you intended. On a 7-9, choose one, and the GM will tell you the result, appropriate to the degree of power:<br />* The trigger is different: more complex, more dangerous, has an added cost, or just completely different. <br />* The effect is different: an unintended side effect, an inverted outcome, or just something different.<br />On a miss, something bad happens.<br /><br /><b>Suggested Moves:</b><br />...it cuts through any lesser weapon.<br />...it fights on its own.<br />...it burns with an unholy flame.<br />...it leaps to its owner’s hand.<br />...it anticipates and parries the movements of lesser swords.<br />...it has a monster instinct: to slay evil.<br />or write your own.<br /><br /><b>Suggested Triggers:</b><br />When you wield this weapon in the light of a full moon…<br />When the right word is spoken...<br />When it has tasted your blood…<br />When it is in the presence of an elf…<br />When wielded by a grandmaster of the sword-art…<br />When used to defend the innocent…<br />or write your own.<br /><br /><b>Suggested Move Complications:</b><br />...and it attracts the attention of something fell or fae.<br />...and it cannot be sheathed until it has spilled blood.<br />...and the sight of it inspires greed in onlookers.<br />...and possessing it gives prophetic nightmares.<br />...and it acts on an agenda of its own.<br />...it has a monster instinct: to slay evil.<br />or something else<br /><br /><b>Suggested Trigger Complications:</b><br />...and it has also tasted innocent blood…<br />...and it has previously slain something you love…<br />...and it is in daylight…<br />...and you obey its cursed whispers... <br />...and you have taken a vow of poverty…<br />...and you lose 1 hitpoint…<br />...and you are standing on earth or stone...<br />or something else

        <p>Personally, I think it will be better suited to a compendium class. But at a first glance, it looks alright. I&#39;ll give some more feedback in a little bit.</p>

        <p>This is definitely a compendium move.<br /><br />...but if it is a compendium move, what moves are you thinking it&#39;ll branch off into?</p>

        <p>Haven&#39;t finished writing them yet, but I&#39;ve got a few I&#39;ve been kicking around:<br /><br /><b>Blacksmith</b><br />When you <i>use your secret art to forge a mundane weapon,</i> describe the weapon you are attempting to forge, including a base description, a range, and a look, then roll+STR. On a 10+, you add 3 mundane tags, and the GM adds 1. On a 7-9, you add 2 and the GM adds 2. On a miss, you still get the weapon, but something bad happens.<br />(intended to give a way to make a special weapon to start enchanting)<br /><br /><b>Fateweaver</b><br />When you <i>give an item a Destiny</i>, intone the words of the command and roll +WIS. On a hit, the item will attempt to carry out that Destiny, and gains the Geas of Destiny move. On a 7-9, also choose 1:<br />* The Destiny’s effects are more widespread than intended<br />* The Destiny has unforeseen consequences<br />* The Destiny is taken too literally<br />* The Destiny takes hold of something other than the intended item.<br /><br /><b>Geas of Destiny</b><br />When you act in accord with a Destiny and against your best interests, mark XP.<br /><br />And a move to specifically create a weapon with it&#39;s own monster-style instinct (and maybe moves).</p>

        <p>For reference, I also looked at some of the existing magic-item-creation stuff:<br /><a href="https://plus.google.com/+AdamKoebel/posts/9gxr1ebGtnt" class="ot-anchor">https://plus.google.com/+AdamKoebel/posts/9gxr1ebGtnt</a><br /><a href="https://plus.google.com/105808699738403752805/posts/3S4gH5XeCVN" class="ot-anchor">https://plus.google.com/105808699738403752805/posts/3S4gH5XeCVN</a><br /><a href="https://plus.google.com/u/0/+CraigHatler/posts/FCbisb6jNqs" class="ot-anchor">https://plus.google.com/u/0/+CraigHatler/posts/FCbisb6jNqs</a></p>

        <p>Check out this dude&#39;s version of the Artificer: <a href="https://eberron-dungeonworld-edition.obsidianportal.com/wikis/the-artificer" class="ot-anchor">https://eberron-dungeonworld-edition.obsidianportal.com/wikis/the-artificer</a><br /><br />It pretty elegantly hits all the bases you&#39;re talking about and then some.</p>

I like coming up with custom moves, but I&#39;ll gladly take a complete class instead!</p>

        <p>Though that Artificer is a bit more general with machines and all, and I was thinking more along the lines of a legendary blacksmith. Though that might work better with a different move as the base.</p>

        <p>What about just using the Fighter move Blacksmith? Or are you looking for more than that?</p>

        <p>Hmm. I forgot about the Fighter move. But I think I am looking for more than that, since the player wants this to be the focus of play.</p>

That&#39;s hilarious! ...it&#39;s also outdated. I&#39;ve been working on an updated version. I won&#39;t be able to access my computer for a bit, as I&#39;m on vacation, but I&#39;ll revise the page as soon as I can. The infusion move is actually what is getting the most revision.</p>

        <p>Okay then, maybe a few more moves would be good. But remember that the character&#39;s lives should be filled with adventure. What does a legendary weaponsmith do with his time? What moves could help him explore the dungeon?</p>

        <p>Well, if it&#39;s a CC instead of a base class, then it&#39;s not really as important. Their base class covers most of the adventuring stuff. I mean, just look at the landed gentry.</p>

        <p>I&#39;m definitely leaning CC at this point; though keeping the adventure in mind is probably a good idea anyway.<br /><br />I&#39;m thinking there probably needs to be something about gathering the raw materials and something about making the swords themselves.</p>
