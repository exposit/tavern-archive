 <a rel="nofollow" class="ot-hashtag" href="https://plus.google.com/s/%23WorldbuildingWednesday/posts">#WorldbuildingWednesday</a>  Upon taking down a group of raiding lizard-men, you find among their possessions a helmet made entirely of a deep red crystal. Instantly you recognize it, but from where and why?

        <p>From a stain glass window from the temple of the sun. It was word by the Other, a being of pure evil and banished to the darkness of the underworld. That window has been haunting your dreams for a few months now. There is no mistaking it. This is the Helm of Tartus.</p>

        <p>See, faeries aren&#39;t like they are in storybooks. You already probably know that, you&#39;ve seen fae and fae beasts come into the world but there&#39;s also some truth to fairy tales. And let me tell you there&#39;s a really different story to the Redcap.</p>

        <p>It opens your eyes to the unseen world that lizardman shamans can interact with. Assuming you can handle the pain from wearing it, of course. Just gouge an eye out, that will fix it!<br /><br />Also, best hashtag ever.</p>

        <p>A scarlet streak flashes across the porthole of my memory. The image of this rouge raiment so strange... yet so familiar. I look to my party and utter: &quot;I read about this in a magazine.&quot; <br /><br />The bard&#39;s words cut through the stagnant air like a knife as he echoes my sentiment. <br /><br />&quot;Oh yeah... I read that too.&quot;</p>

        <p>We sold it to the poor bastards last week, we told them it was lucky! Hilarious! Now we can sell it to some other sods!</p>

        <p>I know it because it belongs to me, these lizard men must have stolen it. And our thief is holding MY helmet. I can tell he wants it, I see the gleam in his eyes, but he can&#39;t have it, it belongs to me. He isn&#39;t looking at me, I can sneak up behind him and cut his throat. That&#39;ll teach him not to take my helmet.<br /><br />In reality, the helmet is cursed. It fills any who behold it with an unnatural urge to possess it, and you will do anything to get your hands on it.</p>

        <p>Sounds like the Helm of Eldritch Power to me.  It allows you to choose a spell from a level above you that you cast at at +1.  Any roll of 6 or less with that spell causes one of your appendages to become a tentacle.</p>
