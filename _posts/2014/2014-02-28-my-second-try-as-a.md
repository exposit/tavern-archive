My second try as a GM? Success! I am just buzzing from the fun we had, I could not have asked for a better bunch of players!<br /><br />We had so much fun that we decided to continue playing together. We made up everything. The whole story. We have a city, a BBEG, an overarching storyline, political intrigue and debts repaid and stolen loot from the jail, and so much fun!<br /><br />I posted here last week at how my first try as a GM was a DREADFUL experience and this time I did so much better! All my players (two I invited back from the first game) were helpful and everyone played well and no one dominated the game or dragged the rulebook out to hit us over the head with.<br /><br />Everything felt, to me, very collaborative.<br /><br />It was a joy to play DW! Yeah!

We had so much fun that we decided to continue playing together. We made up everything. The whole story. We have a city, a BBEG, an overarching storyline, political intrigue and debts repaid and stolen loot from the jail, and so much fun!

I posted here last week at how my first try as a GM was a DREADFUL experience and this time I did so much better! All my players (two I invited back from the first game) were helpful and everyone played well and no one dominated the game or dragged the rulebook out to hit us over the head with.

Everything felt, to me, very collaborative.

It was a joy to play DW! Yeah!</a>

        <p>Huzzah!<br /><br />The first time <i>I</i> ran this game, I did a really, <i>really</i> lousy job. It&#39;s just so different than what I was used to running. Luckily, I picked up on it rather quick, especially because the Tavern (and forum) crowd were so helpful.</p>

The tavern people here, for the most part, are a great bunch of people and I am learning a lot. This time I think two things really helped. One, I had really awesome players who were easygoing, not pushy, just helpful and such good imaginations! And two, I used <a href="http://www.rpgsolo.com/" class="ot-anchor">http://www.rpgsolo.com/</a> to help me come up with stuff so I was not stressed out. Oh and one more thing. I did not prepare ANYTHING at all. We all just made it up on the spot using character backstories and asking questions. We all created the story together.</p>

        <p>Making stuff up on the spot is the hardest thing to do. Luckily it gets easier over time.</p>

        <p>I love the post-GM buzz. It makes up for the pre-GM jitters. :)</p>

        <p>I did (and still do at times) suffer from &quot;trying to run DW like it is the other games I play&quot; syndrome.  It is quite the shit in thinking - both as a GM and a player.</p>
