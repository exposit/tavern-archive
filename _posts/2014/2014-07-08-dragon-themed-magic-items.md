        <p>Lash of Immola    Reach, Near, 0 weight.<br /><br />A 7 inch shaft of crimson grain wood, with a golden dragon head at one end. If raised a fiery tendril snakes out from the dragons mouth to form a whip. Immola was the first child of Ragnarok, a great fire Wyrm.<br /><br />Magic item I put together for my group, Ragnarok is the wrathful God of Fire and Light in our world. </p>

        <p>Kadmiel, the sword quenched in a dragon&#39;s heartblood. Absorbs the heat and quenches the flames of any fire it is plunged into, radiating that heat back out. Thirsts to be quenched once more in dragon blood.</p>

        <p>The Scales of the King of Dragons (0 weight, indestructible, divine, collect them all [7])<br />When the king of the dragons left the world to join his creator beyond the stars, he left behind seven scales, each a different color, and scattered them across the world. Legend has it that if you collect all seven scales the dragon will come down from heaven and grant you one perfect wish. Afterwards the scales will once again scatter across the world and turn to stone for one year.</p>

        <p>dragon scrotum cape<br /><br />gets some odd looks at the local inn...<br /><br />but offers complete protection from Fire and heat where it covers (as an umbrella from rain, not an aura effect)</p>

        <p>Fang of Ferrier&#39;s Bog: an ancient bronze dagger that a hero used to skin and dress the black dragon of Ferrier&#39;s Bog and her wyrmlings. It slowly drips acid when exposed to air. Hope that it&#39;s air-tight scabbard isn&#39;t damaged.</p>

        <p>Ring of Embers: A gold ring with a gem that looks identical to a cut ruby but is actually crystallized dragon blood. Mentally links the wearer to the dragon whose blood it is. This allows them to communicate with or even control the dragon, but it can also work the other way around...</p>

        <p>There was an awesome helm in Terry Amthor&#39;s ShadowWorld that the demi-god-like Dragonlord&#39;s wore allowing them to take human form more or less indefinitely. It had loads of other enhancements as well as allowing them to use their breath weapons and attack damage in human form as if they were Super-Large creatures.<br /><br />(BTW That&#39;s &#39;awesome&#39; in the traditional sense, not in the &#39;these hotdogs are awesome&#39; sense.)</p>

        <p>From my campaign :<br /><br />Fang - A Kukri forged by a renegade dwarven smith out of iron and pulverized dragon bone, with an Adamantium edge.  Any wound made with Fang is instantly cauterized.  It heals it&#39;s victims of any toxins or poisons in their blood and gives them 3 armor against magic for a few minutes.  Any cut it makes seals instantly, but will never heal.<br /><br />Thrust of Althethen - A spearhead crafted by the same renegade smith of iron and pulverized dragon bone (I like this recipe - working flesh-carbon like bone or skin into iron like that was an early take on manufacturing steel) wrapped entirely in adamantium.  It is warm to the touch, but the adamantium traps it&#39;s viciousness.  When a thinking creature is first damaged by the spearhead the attacker may steal the answer of any one question from the victim&#39;s mind.  They don&#39;t know what they have revealed, but it will be true and thorough.  PCs receive XP if their answers are complete and advance / suggest a potential Front or Grim Portent.<br /><br />Dragon Leather Armor - Just regular armor made of &#39;regular&#39; red dragon skin.  No special treatment.  It warms the wearer, allowing them to travel in the Frozen North without making the &#39;Seeking The NorthWest Passage&#39; move (a custom move that slowly drains CON)<br /><br />Red Dragon Armor - Technically scale mail, made of overlapping dragon scales.  Not imbued with any particular magic, excepting that inherent in dragons.  Negates damage from spells with FIRE or HEAT tags, mundane fire/heat damage, and allows travel through the Frozen North without the &#39;Seeking The NorthWest Passage&#39; move.  <br />(.... also, if Fang or Althethen are ever sunk into it the consciousness of Althethen will reawaken.  This will be bad.)<br /><br />Green Dragon Armor [2 armor, clumsy, stench] - Made of much smaller scales than Red Dragon Armor, the reforged dermis of one of the Kobold gods seems like a smelly, clumsy mess.  The stench draws attention.  When targeted by an undesired spell, however, Roll + WIS.  On a 10+ you take one Hold and are not affected by the spell.  On a 7-9 take one Hold but suffer from the spell.  On a miss not only are you affected by the spell but you lose all Hold.<br />Spend a Hold to remove a tag from the armor for 24 hours, deal your damage to a creature or creatures physically restraining you, or reduce the amount of time needed to reacquire spells by half.<br />If the armor ever goes a week without any Hold it loses its power and begins to fall apart.  It will quickly be rendered useless.</p>

        <p><b>The Dragon of Reno, Nevada</b><br /><br />This is a 1942 Indian 841 motorcycle that is now possessed with the spirit of the Wawel Dragon, who once terrorized the city of Krakow and it&#39;s environs in the Middle Ages.  Back in 1952 the Wawel Dragon was hard up and made a bad bet on a hand of blackjack in a special basement room for &quot;select special&quot; customers at the Bank Club, resulting in his spiritual servitude.  <br /><br />It has been in the custody of several people over the years, including briefly the film director Russ Meyer, who used it to perform the incredible stunts in the never released and now lost 1966 biker film &quot;The Dragon&#39;s Dames&quot;.<br /><br />The moral of the story is never hit on 17 when Urania, the muse of Astronomy, is the dealer.</p>
