I&#39;ve got a vague memory that people around here think that &quot;chaining&quot; moves together directly, without going via the fiction and a new &quot;what do you do?&quot;, is a bad idea. For example, this wouldn&#39;t be seen as a great move design...<br /><br />&quot;When you try to cast a spell within the destablised zone, roll +WIS. On 10+, you&#39;re fine - roll Cast a Spell as normal. On 7-9, roll Cast a Spell but also...&quot;<br /><br />...because this move sends you on to another move (&quot;cast a spell&quot;) without doing anything in the fiction.<br /><br />Is there actually a disadvantage to doing that?

        <p>I favor putting fiction in between moves and not triggering multiple moves with one action, but this is a chaining example that works. You&#39;ve already established in the fiction that the spell caster is in the destabilized zone. It adds flavor and a nasty environmental effect.</p>

        <p>As vanilla Apocalypse World does that (you can do it but it is acting under fire) that is an okay thing to do but should be explained in the fiction as well. What is it that causes you to have to do X?</p>

        <p>In the course of play, triggering more than one move in a chain is fine, but having a move trigger another move as written seems to be a bad idea. (There are moves that change how another move works, just not ones that trigger multiple moves)<br /><br />the fighter charging in and doing a homerun slide so she can stab the soft belly of the dragon would trigger defy danger and then hack and slash because fiction.<br /><br />A character with a move that says something more like &quot;when you spout lore you also discern realities and cast a spell&quot; would not work so well.﻿<br /><br />The example in the post sounds like a perfect Defy Danger +WIS. And then the wizard casts after that.</p>

        <p>I think a more elegant way is to modify the roll of the original move with new fictional outcomes instead of nesting rolls. <br /><br />&quot;When you cast a spell or utilise your magic in the phantom zone, on a 7-9 you also...&quot;</p>

        <p>It seems to me that chaining rolls together is effectively the GM fishing for failure, like a GM constantly calling for rolls until the player fails the action they were trying to do in a more traditional game.</p>

At least since the Dungeon Starters were released anyways. There&#39;s certainly a lot of scope for special moves based on all sorts of special circumstances, at least some of them will interact with the regular moves mechanically.</p>

In the specific example you used either <span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink" href="https://plus.google.com/113847025671240258531" oid="113847025671240258531">Adrian Thoen</a></span>&#39;s version or your tweak of it sound good - they modify the move&#39;s effects without changing the probability of each outcome class. (a side effect of that is that it&#39;s easier for the GM-as-move-designer to understand the effect on the game overall, I think)<br /><br />(If 6- is left unspecified, the GM can, as normal, take the situation into account when making a hard move - the move could, and perhaps should, be more disruptive than a normal Cast a Spell failure.)<br /><br />That said, my real example <i>is</i> one of taking a standard move and making it harder. It&#39;s roughly this:<br /><br />&quot;When <b>you try to cast two spells simultaneously</b> roll +WIS. On 10+ you&#39;re fine, roll Cast a Spell once and apply the result to both spells. On 7-9 continue as 10+ but also...&quot;<br /><br />i.e. I&#39;m trying to provide a higher-risk higher-return variant of an existing move. What do people think about this? Is it a good idea to have this kind of move?<br /><br />(One thought about this new example - the number rolls here is the same as if they&#39;d cast the spells one after the other as normal.)</p>

In contrast, both my examples are known to the player up front (at least after the first time) and call for a specific number of extra rolls (one).</p>

On a 10+, both spells are successfully cast and neither is revoked by your deity—you may cast them again later.<br /><br />On a 7-9, choose one:<br />&gt;One spell is successfully cast (as if you rolled a 10+ on Cast a Spell) and the other fails (as if you rolled a 6- on Cast a Spell)<br />&gt;Both spells are successfully cast, but choose one option for each spell on the regular 7-9 Cast a Spell list<br /><br /><br />On a 6-, the GM gets to make 2 moves.<br /><br />You can always remove the 6- text and let the GM decide what is appropriate.</p>

        <p>So, I think the final move is:<br /><br />When you try to play two themes at the same time, roll +WIS.<br />·      On 10+, both themes have their beneficial effect<br />·      On 7-9, choose one:<br />o   One theme has its beneficial effect only (as if you rolled 10+ to play it on its own) and the other fails (as if you rolled a 6- to play it on its own)<br />o   Both themes have their beneficial effect, but are also subject to their ugly choice (as if you rolled a 7-9 to play them on their own)<br />·      On a 6-, both themes go wrong and the combined effect is disastrous<br /><br /><br />I normally don&#39;t like specifying 6- effects, since there&#39;s already a general subsystem to handle that (and few core DW moves specify them). In this case, however, I think a reminder to the GM is useful - if this move is triggered, then the failure result should be unusually bad.<br /><br />Thanks all for your help with this.</p>
