<br />Good Evening.<br />Me and my friend were talking about the ritual  of the Wizard.<br />I have used it only with the fiction. A typical request can be &quot;I use a Ritual! I give the strength of the Titans to my friends!!&quot;<br /><br />Now my friend say: &quot;I use the Ritual! I give to my friends +5 to the Strength rolls!&quot;<br /><br />It is possible? I always assumed that the player can talk just about the fiction, not about the mechanics.

        <p>I wouldn&#39;t allow the second request but I would allow &quot;I want to give them a Strength of 18&quot;.<br />Giving them the strength of a Titan is way cooler though. </p>

        <p>The moves begin and end with the fiction. Nevertheless, everything in DW is prescriptive and descriptive. So if you <i>describe</i> the group as &quot;strong as titans&quot;, you may prescribe any rules you think are necessary to make it so. </p>

        <p>I&#39;d like to imagine that just because the character is now super strong, it doesn&#39;t mean that they instantly how to fight or use their strength to their best advantage. So you are super strong now but that doesn&#39;t mean you are inherently a better fighter. You might not need to trigger H&amp;S on some occasions. </p>

He is very strong, but he doesn&#39;t know how to use is strength. More roll on Strength means more Hard Moves from GM. Each level this warrior can improve his ability with the strength, reaching the 18 with the 10th level.<br /><br />So Yes, I start with the fiction and end with the fiction, I don&#39;t see the need of give a +x bonus to a character for simulating is strength. (i&#39;m sorry for my english)</p>

        <p>Sure give them Strength of a Titan. Just be sure that they can&#39;t turn it off.<br /><br />&quot;Oh you want to pick up the princess and carry her out of here? Defy danger DEX.&quot;<br /><br />/rollsdice<br /><br />&quot;Oh a 5...well you crush her in half due to the fact that you have the strength of a titan.&quot;<br /><br />The most enjoyable way to mess with a player is to give them exactly what they want. :P</p>

Titan strenght is titan strenght. Sure. When its possible maybe I &quot;Turn their move back on them&quot; or &quot;Show a downside to their class, race, or equipment&quot;.<br /><br />Usually I&#39;m not so happy to ruin something the player has obtained paying the price that I have established.<br />When is possibile I prefer &quot;Offer an opportunity, with or without cost&quot; or &quot;Tell them the requirements or consequences and ask&quot;</p>

        <p>I understand not wanting to screw over the players if they worked hard for something. I guess I should have asked how hard the ritual was to put together. Never go cheap on a ritual, especially when you put something like that on the line.</p>

        <p>The wizard pulls out two tomes. One is covered in dust and and is huge. It looks like it hasn&#39;t been opened in centuries. The other looks like it was made within the last year but has dog eared pages and and tears from constant use. &quot;I can offer you what you want,&quot; the wizard said, &quot;and I offer you two ways to go about it. The first would take years to do, would cost you a small kingdom, and would require the sacrifice of your true love. The...other...way would require 40 gold, a chicken, and silk pants, but you really don&#39;t want to go cheap on stuff like this.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Screw that I&#39;ll take the cheap one.&quot;<br /><br />The wizard sigh&#39;s and puts the old tome away and cracks open the DIY Rituals for the Frugal Wizard penned by the Archmage Pintrest. The wizard laments, &quot;It never turns out like in the pictures.&quot;</p>

        <p>Ah no worries man. I was just having a bit of fun. In all seriousness I&#39;d stick with the fiction and try to leave mechanics alone. Like what was said above, &quot;Just because they have this insane strength doesn&#39;t mean they know how to use it.&quot; Leave the dice and numbers alone but be sure to let the fiction reflect what the ritual did.</p>

        <p>The &quot;i would allow STR=18&quot; thing was mostly because a +3 totally works within the game. A +5 breaks all kinds of things mechanically. <br />It is not something I would advice players to do. </p>

I usually enjoy the forced choices, continue the mission or heal the princess. The players choice, but either choice causes more interesting fictional development.</p>
