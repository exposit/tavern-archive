I played a simple game for my two kids on the weekend. My daughter, Jemima, is 6 and my son, Gulliver, is 8 and they are aware that I play RPGs though they are a little light on the detail of what goes on.<br /><br />After rolling up a halfling thief called &quot;Trixie&quot; for Jemima and a human Fighter called &quot;Damager&quot; for Gulliver we got down to it. I gave them a brief synopsis about the awesome but tiring adventures they&#39;d had over the last few days and then there was a howling and a woman&#39;s scream from up ahead among the trees.<br /><br />&quot;What do you do?&quot;<br /><br />They freakin&#39; loved it! Trixie put herself in danger to get the shot on the werewolf, while Damager lay about him, dispatching the wolf pack with aplomb.<br /><br />Needless to say they want to play again :-)<br /><br />Thanks Dungeon World!
