So one of the ten- (possibly eleven-)year-olds in a game I run wrote this gunslinger compendium class and sent it to me, completely unbidden and without warning. I now present it to you for feedback.

Ten-year-olds really like firearms. Even in a medieval fantasy role-playing game, even after I’ve warned them about medieval small arms’ weight, inaccuracy, unreliability, reload time, etc. compared...

        <p>if one of the move names isn&#39;t &quot;unbidden and without warning&quot; that needs to change with a quickness.</p>

        <p>I do like that the extra weapon moves are all called &quot;Thank You For The <i>___</i>&quot;. Very polite.</p>

        <p>A bit repetitive in parts &amp; easy to avoid using while finding a good alternative with in the class compilations in the DW community here or just going with a fighter specializing in ranged bows. While I&#39;ve seen guns injected in fantasy with some mmos they always feel oddly put in. Also having a long reload time in guns like these is a good balance in rules but as you are reloading, you/allies/friends are getting hit around with all kinds of sharp pointy things or being eaten. Thanks but nope as just doesn&#39;t sound fun for DW. Future settings like pirates or whatnot having a gun specialist, sure makes sense there but reloading a gun in here just makes you an ineffective fighter &amp; a target.﻿<br /><br />I&#39;m sure once shows him/her Lord of the Rings films they will be through the gun phase to a fan of elven archers/rangers.</p>

        <p>I don&#39;t understand why no one is arguing that Hidden Shot should clearly be <i>Unbidden and without Warning</i></p>
