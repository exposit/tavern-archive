Did someone try to start a game by carryng to th table Class Warfare and asking the players to build their own playbook? How long would it take? Is it a feasible option for a first session?

        <p>I haven&#39;t done that yet. The book points out that building a &quot;playbook&quot; is a longer and more thought-requiring process than just building a character from a theme, without requiring that it work as a <i>class</i>.  So keep that in mind.  I do <i>think</i> that it&#39;s a reasonable first-session goal, but you might want more than one copy of CW to pass around.</p>

        <p>(pure theory here...) doable for a first session, but only advisable if the players have actually played dungeon world using pre-built classes in the past. </p>

        <p>I would prefer doing that if peopl were already comfortable with the material in the book or came with some combos they had in mind. Handling that book and looking through ALL the options would take too much time I figure. </p>

        <p>I assume that when doing this, if I were the only person familiar with CW, I&#39;d offer up the playbooks/classes I like and also offer up CW as a custom method if someone has a concept or theme that isn&#39;t hit by what&#39;s available. And then I&#39;d guide the players who wanted to customize through the process.<br /><br />&quot;What&#39;s your concept?&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Oh, that sounds like this.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Not exactly? OK, we can modify it by swapping this into the build.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Cool, copy this, this and this stuff down...&quot;</p>

        <p>It took me about 45 mins to read through everything I was interested in, pick out what I wanted, and 10 more minutes to write everything down in a way that makes sense. <br /><br />Now that I know the book better, I could probably do the entire thing in 20 mins, depending on what I wanted to make.<br /><br />One warning: Creating a character class should be a fun activity, and shouldn&#39;t be rushed. Don&#39;t let creation cut into your game, just tell people who want to make their character&#39;s to show up an hour early.</p>

        <p>In summary: it takes quite a lot of time even if the players already know how the book works.<br />Maybe I&#39;ll try out when I start a second campaign with the same players.</p>
