How do your players typically handle their bonds?<br /><br />My group of 5 players filled out every bond during the first session, averaging 4 bonds per character and usually with 1 bond to each other character. This lead to a lot of great backstory and world-building. However, since that time they&#39;ve been very hesitant to finish bonds, and they often tiptoe around them instead of really pushing on them when they come up in play.<br /><br />For example:<br />* Player A is afraid that Player B might discover A&#39;s terrible secret. However, when B read his mind and A got to choose a secret to divulge, he tossed out something minor and unrelated.<br />* Player C thinks player D is weak. Over 6 sessions, C has watched D and generally said, &quot;Yes, this is good evidence to support changing my mind... but I need a little more.&quot;<br /><br />Early on, the players expressed worry that resolving their bonds would dry up the reasons they have for adventuring together, or that making new bonds beyond the initial world-building session would be awkward. I assume neither of those facts are true, but we still haven&#39;t bumped into it.<br /><br />So I&#39;m looking for feedback on how others (both GMs and players) deal with bonds on a session-to-session basis, and maybe even some ways to help show my players how resolving their bonds more often can be a good thing.

        <p>Remind the heroes that they are dynamic characters and their relationships will evolve over time. At end of session, look for ways to fit bonds to session highlights - even if it&#39;s not exact, when the heroes remember that badass moment from earlier in the night, they&#39;ll be like, &quot;Yeah we deserve XP for that!&quot; Then be free with suggestions for new bonds that are incrementally different as opposed to paradigm-shifting. </p>

        <p>So would you recommend just telling the players when they&#39;ve resolved a bond? So far I&#39;ve been letting them tell me whether they think they&#39;ve resolved one or not.</p>

        <p>Don&#39;t worry about it. If your players don&#39;t really want to engage that part of the system it won&#39;t break anything. I personally like the tasty XP but everyone loves different stuff. </p>

        <p>I tend to agree with <span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink" href="https://plus.google.com/110330901807759406775" oid="110330901807759406775">Tim Franzke</a></span>. If your players aren&#39;t interested in resolving Bonds, it&#39;s no big deal. If your players want to keep their original Bonds because they feel they&#39;re what&#39;s holding the party together, that&#39;s fine.<br /><br />Just keep asking if anyone&#39;s Bonds have been resolved at the end of each session as part of the End of Session move. Make the players aware that they <i>can</i> resolve Bonds if they wish to, but don&#39;t make them feel as if they <i>have</i> to do so.</p>

        <p>I&#39;m one of those player who likes to keep the bonds as they are, for lot of sessions, if I don&#39;t really feel the relationship with the other character is really changed. Don&#39;t rash with them, don&#39;t chase the easy XP if you aren&#39;t fully sure.</p>

        <p>the bond really needs to change for me.   if  character A thinks character B is weak. i dont care if B does a few strong things, he needs to convince A that his character is strong always and not just by saying &quot;i killed the dragon i am strong&quot; .  character B needs to get up in Character A&#39;s face and say &quot;man what is your problem with me!?! lets settle this now and forever. armwrestle! the loser cuts off his thumb!!&quot;    after that of course A has to accept that B is strong. and you have a new bond &quot;i hate B for embarassing me and makeing me cut off my thumb&quot;</p>
