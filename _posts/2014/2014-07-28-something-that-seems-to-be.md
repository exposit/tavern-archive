Something that seems to be different in my copy of the book than what people say is damage from multiple monsters... my copy of the book says: &quot;If multiple creatures attack at once roll the highest damage among them and add +1 damage for each monster beyond the first.&quot; (p24)<br /><br />But I&#39;ve seen a few people saying that you roll them all and use the highest.<br /><br />Which is it?

        <p>I&#39;ve always used the +1 per additional monster rule. Maybe some people house-rule the &quot;roll all, take highest&quot;?</p>

        <p>My dead tree version says <i>If multiple creatures attack at once roll the highest damage among them and add +1 damage for each monster beyond the first.</i> Â (p22)</p>

        <p>It used to be that you&#39;d roll all and take the highest, but they changed it before the book came out.</p>

        <p>Where are we meant to go to get the newest version of the rules? For instance the character sheets on what I thought wqs the official website includes rules fire a barbarian but I haven&#39;t seen this anywhere else.</p>

        <p>The barbarian was released by Adam and Sage after the core book was released as a Kickstarter stretch goal.</p>
