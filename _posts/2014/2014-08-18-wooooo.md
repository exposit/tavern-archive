Wooooo! Starting up a campaign with a new group tonight, so it&#39;ll be a First Session this time around. Interested to see what classes they pick. I don&#39;t know much about what they&#39;re looking for (yet), but one of them wants to see elementals involved...<br /><br />I love how you can start running the game off the cuff like this. I&#39;m excited to create Fronts!

        <p>I&#39;m just planning on presenting them with the main classes from the core book. Hadn&#39;t really considered limiting them.</p>

        <p>First session report: we only had two players, but it was a comedy of errors as they were beset by a pack of crocodiles in a boggy river valley.<br /><br />Then they both fell asleep and woke up to a group of lizard-folk surrounding them. This is gonna be a hilarious group already.</p>
