Probably old news, but our group took the Inglorious warfare rules out for a spin this evening, and they were fantastic.

        <p>I&#39;ve been meaning to try the Warrior out.  Which rules did you use?</p>

        <p>We did not delve into the player roles from Chapter 1 (preview 2), only the general unit engagement stuff from Chapter 2 (preview 1). It took about an hour, with about 15 units split among 3 factions. Probably a lot less once we all know how to stat up units quickly.</p>

        <p>One oddity cropped up, resolved by the GM rolling some dice (which we know to be against the DW precepts): the PCs were in command of 4 units, but their Elven allies had 7, commanded by an NPC. Within two &quot;rounds&quot; it became clear that if the NPC units automatically succeeded in their attacks, then they would win the battle even if the PCs just twiddled their thumbs.<br /><br />My solution (supported by player consensus) was to make a command roll for the Elven general, which made the proceedings a bit more interesting.<br /><br />What would you guys do?</p>

        <p>Also, I&#39;m a little fuzzy on how often units deal and take damage. In combat we use &quot;loose rounds&quot;, where PCs just call out what they&#39;re doing in any order they like, and I make moves as needed. When everyone has acted, we go back to the top.<br /><br />I deemed that units would give and take damage once per &quot;round&quot;, whenever it made sense in the fiction. This resulted in foot units being highly expendable, and archers being tremendously effective.<br /><br />This all makes a certain amount of sense, but I&#39;m curious if others have done it differently.</p>
