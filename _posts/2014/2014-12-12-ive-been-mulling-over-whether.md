I&#39;ve been mulling over whether to test/implement this one.  What do you think?<br /><br />&quot;When someone deals damage and rolls the lowest possible amount of damage the GM will make a hard move against the target of the attack.&quot;

        <p>So, like Thief attacks Goblin, hits, rolls 1 damage... and then a hard move against the Goblin? I&#39;m not sure what a hard move against a monster would mean. </p>

        <p>&quot;Mitigating Strike (House Rule): When someone rolls their minimum damage, they may choose one:<br />* they knock their target back<br />* they disarm their target<br />* they knock their target down<br />* they force their target closer<br />* an ally of theirs takes +1 against the target (say how)&quot;</p>

        <p>The lowest possible roll you can roll is ONE, but the lowest possible damage you can deal is ZERO.<br /><br />What if the target has an armor of 3. You can roll a 1 and would get the affect of the bonus, but you could also roll a 2 or a 3 and still deal no damage and NOT get the bonus either. It would create a situation where getting the lowest possible damage would be preferable to dealing some damage.<br /><br />Are you sure you want to introduce that into your game?</p>

        <p>Also it&#39;s more likely to trigger for characters with smaller damage dice, meaning that such characters can potentially create more combat fiction than high damage characters whose shtick is combat fiction.</p>
