I&#39;m mulling over a martial artist move based on the cliche that a gang of bad guys only attacks the martial artist one at a time, but I can&#39;t quite get my head around the verbiage. Thoughts?

        <p>Need more detail. <br /><br />Is it:<br /><br /><b>You Want To Fight? Fight Me!</b><br /><b>When challenging a group of identical opponents to fight you one at a time,</b> roll +CHA. On a 10+, they come at you, one at a time, the next one making his move as soon as the prior one drops. On a 7-9, they&#39;ll come at you two at a time. On a miss, you get dogpiled. If anyone else attacks a member of the group at any time during this process, that member drops out of group and the &quot;queue&quot;. <br /><br />... or some other paradigm?</p>

        <p>I felt like the description in the OP was a little bit different from the &quot;many ninjas = all incompetent; one ninja = insane badass&quot; continuum.</p>

        <p>When you H&amp;S against a gang of faceless mooks, they coordinate their efforts poorly and come at you in only ones or twos. On a hit, deal your damage to everyone in the group. If the group deals damage to you, it doesn&#39;t get the +1 per opponent damage bonus for outnumbering you.</p>

        <p>&quot;By the will of the gods, your terrifying presence or some other, more obscure reason, whenever you are attacked, it is only ever by one foe at a time. If questioned after the fact, no one is ever sure why they didn&#39;t just gang up on you.&quot;</p>

        <p>When you find yourself facing more than one enemy, yell like a Ninja. Your enemies will notice you, but only one will be able to attack at a time.</p>

        <p>Great ideas! Thanks!<br /><br />I&#39;m fiddling around with The Black Belt, a 70s blaxploitation character class featuring moves such as <i>One at a Time</i>, <i>Tumblin&#39; Up Tumblin&#39; Down</i>, and <i>But I Know Ka-Razy!</i>.</p>

        <p><b>When you are hopelessly outnumbered in a fight and you invoke the Law of Inverse Ninja Power</b>, describe the battle in epic, cinematic style and roll+Str.<br /><br />☆On 10+, you kill every damn mook in sight and survive with exactly 1 HP<br />☆On 7-9 you kill every damn mook in sight but as you kill the last one you succumb to your wounds.<br />If a beloved hero cries over your broken body, take +1 when you roll your Last Breath. If you do pass through the Black Gates your heroic death will be remembered, and songs will be sung of you for ages to come.<br />☆On 6- you are overrun by the foul horde, your men are killed and your women and children lament as they are driven off into slavery.</p>
