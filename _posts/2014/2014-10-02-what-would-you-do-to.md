What would you do to take advantage of a game being run by two DMs (simultaneously) instead of one? <b>Dungeon World</b> especially seems well-suited, but I&#39;m curious to get the community&#39;s opinion.<br /><br />In this case, my buddy and I will be running a one-shot this Saturday for six players. We&#39;re planning to use the 4-hour con format by <span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink" href="https://plus.google.com/113677679278469240206" oid="113677679278469240206">John Aegard</a></span> . It&#39;s the group&#39;s first DW experience, and they have a big range of experience RPing in general.

For the second encounter we&#39;re planning to figure out a way to split them up using the location, potentially forcing them to work their way through it independently.<br /><br />What do you think makes for an especially engaging split?</p>

        <p>Conversational nature of DW lends itself well to dual GMs as long as the two don&#39;t contradict each other (too often). Each player will usually gravitate toward one GM or the other; you can intentionally break that to good effect as long as the two GMs are in harmony. Overall it should give each player more spotlight time. Even when all the players are the same place, each GM can zoom in on different characters. Then you can do fun things where you pull a player&#39;s attention from one GM to the other, while the other GM grabs one of your characters, etc. </p>

        <p>What if we made <b>everyone</b> a GM...</p>
