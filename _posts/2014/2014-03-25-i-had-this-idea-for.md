I had this idea for a move for intuitive mechanical savant type characters, and was wondering what people think:<br /><br /><b>When you take time to closely examine a magical or mechanical device</b>, Roll +INT.<br />On a 10+ You comprehend the function and use of the device perfectly (Similar to Spout Lore)<br />7-9 choose 2<br />6- choose 1, GM makes move<br /><br />-You know exactly what the device does<br />-You know how to operate the device<br />-You understand how to recreate the device<br />-Using the Device does not consume resources<br />-Using the device has no side effects

        <p>Cool!<br />I would save the &#39;use the device perfectly&#39; for an advanced move on a 13+<br />On a 10-12 the player can choose 4 maybe?</p>

        <p>I kinda wanted to keep to the 10,7-9,6- pattern. besides, the GM would still have their moves if things start to spiral too far out there.</p>

        <p>True true. I like that the player still gets one choice on a miss. Nice.</p>

        <p>So on a 10+ they know exactly what it does, how to operate it, how to recreate it, and don&#39;t spend resources or suffer side effects? I think it&#39;s a pretty generous move. I&#39;d consider either losing the partial success on a miss or making a 10+ a &quot;pick 3&quot;</p>

        <p>Good point Ryan Sullivan.<br />Alessandro, I have seen it, but I had a thought for a much smaller range of Moves (or just a single move) that could either be a racial move or an abbreviated CC for another class.<br /><br />Really, I&#39;m just brainstorming and wanted to see opinions.</p>

        <p>The artificer has a move called <b>let me see that</b> that lets them ask 2 of the following 4 questions whenever they study some arcane contraption:<br />- What does this do?<br />- Who made this?<br />- What&#39;s wrong with this and how can I fix it?<br />- What was done most recently with/to this?<br /><br />There&#39;s no roll; the player just gets to ask.  I really like the move.  Provides a good jumping off point for a lot of mysterious stuff the PCs encounter. </p>

        <p>Though I must say, I really like your &quot;on a miss choose 1; the GM makes a move&quot; approach.  You could alternately make the trigger include the choice.  For example:<br /><br />When you <b>closely examine a mechanicl or magical device</b>, pick one of the options below and roll +INT.  *On a 10+, the GM picks a second option for you.  On a miss, your examination has consequences; ask the GM what they are.<br /> (list as above)</p>

        <p>I like that a lot!<br />I purposely wanted my &quot;pick some&quot; list to be all things that a player would want, but could also be easily and obviously reversed. Transparent consequences and outcomes</p>
