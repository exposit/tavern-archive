Our Thursday group is outside a king&#39;s tomb and the boss of the dungeon is the king&#39;s ghost. One of my players is about to use Contact Spirits to summon the king&#39;s ghost. I think this will lead to initiating the boss fight somewhat early...﻿

        <p>The king will never come at the summons of a commoner. He&#39;ll send a minion ghost.</p>

        <p>Make everyone roll defy danger, randomly determine who the ghost possesses out of those that fail.</p>

        <p>Why randomly? Choose 1 specifically. Maybe the one that is afraid of ghosts or has a weak will or a prior connection to the king. Make a move.</p>

        <p>Yeah, it&#39;s reliant on who fails, if anyone at all. Randomly was just kind of sentence filler.</p>

        <p>Does the king ghost want the party to enter the tomb? If so he could act all innocent and friendly now...<br /><br />And then turn out to be the villain in the end. Dun dun duuuuun!</p>

        <p>You&#39;re an evil ghost king. You have a plan, an agenda, something <i>you&#39;re doing</i>. And then... You&#39;re summoned to the mouth of the tomb (because they used the spell with that in mind, and you don&#39;t roll to succeed at spells unless there are mitigating circumstances) where there are adventurers.<br /><br /><i>What do you do?</i><br /><br />You&#39;re a king, damnit, scheme and ply and betray and lie to get what you really want. Maybe it&#39;ll be an awesome fight -- in which case the tomb is still full of treasure and baddies yeah? Maybe the King totally convinces the party that he&#39;s more useful lingering than dispelled.</p>

        <p>Did you read the Chronicle of Thomas Covenant? The main character meets the Big Bad just as he enters the Land. That&#39;s not an easy meeting, for Thomas.<br />The villain speaks Doom for the PCs, how he is unimaginably more powerful, stronger, smarter and how they are poooor, miserable midgets. then, &quot;What do you do?&quot;<br />&quot;WE&#39;LL SEE, jerk!&quot;<br /><br />P.S. please, for the sake of friendship with your peers, do not cast Negate Move on the PCs.</p>

But me? As a king, even a dead one, I would never lower myself to be summoned by commoners. That&#39;s just role playing the kings role, not being not a fan of the characters! </p>

        <p>maybe the fact that he CAN be summoned is what makes the ghost so angry? Maybe they could Discern Realities to see this and then say they threw a grand feast in his name? Spend some rations, the bard can sing, the thief can juggle, some defy danger +CHA rolls and TA DA! He&#39;s on their side and helps guide his new loyal servants threw the tomb to safety?<br /><br />In DW you can &quot;defeat&quot; stuff in so man ways, reducing their HP to zero is often the LEAST interesting.</p>

        <p>You could have some object in the king&#39;s burial chamber that has his spirit tethered. The object must be destroyed in order to banish the king&#39;s spirit. He could appear throughout the dungeon delve taunting, insulting, or even advising the heroes. </p>

Love this community!</p>
