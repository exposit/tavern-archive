I have this Patreon project, where I make monsters with an artist friend of mine. After trying it out for a little while, we decided that, since Patreon is supposed to be about making free stuff, we should be giving away more free monsters. So hey: have a free monster!<br /><a href="http://www.patreon.com/creation?hid=676002" class="ot-anchor">http://www.patreon.com/creation?hid=676002</a>

<a href='http://www.patreon.com/creation?hid=676002'>June 2014: Dungeon World Monthly Monster</a>


Since Patreon is about making free things, this is the month we start making the Monthly Monster a public release. Our first offering is the Dungeon World version of a science fantasy villain: the Vertiginous Infiltrators.

They were created to infiltrate an alien race, to mimic their every move, and turn their secrets over to militaristic invaders. But now that race is extinct, and the vertiginous infiltrators have no one to mimic anymore.
