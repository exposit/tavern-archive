*Time and possibly date are flexible!* If you want to come but can't make it at the appointed hour, let me know and we'll see what we can do!

Come on down, and help defend a tiny kobold village* against an onslaught of XP-seeking humans, the ravages of cruel mother nature, and everything else that wants to kill and possibly eat you!

I'm looking for 3-5 players, and being familiar with the rules is not a necessity, as they are Apocalyptically simple. We'd be running for about four hours, ideally. I'm not specifically aiming for anything longer than a one-shot, but if it goes well, we might see about carrying on from there. Interested? Then hit that "Yes" button!

*A tiny village of kobolds, or a village of tiny kobolds, you ask? _Yes._

        <p>Yeah I can&#39;t make Tuesday at that time. I could make Monday or Wednesday. But if it conflicts with others, no biggie.</p>

        <p>I can move it to Wednesday, then, since it works for the two who&#39;ve responded thus far. Same time work for everyone?</p>

        <p>If you can come, Matt, that would make for the cap of five. Anyone after this: consider yourself an alternate in case someone can&#39;t show! Which can happen, so don&#39;t feel too spooked to sign up.<br /><br />I might, <i>might</i> consider a game of six at some point once I&#39;m comfortable with the system, but that&#39;s a very &quot;we&#39;ll see&quot; situation.</p>

        <p>Okie-dokes, all, game&#39;s on in about six hours!<br /><br />Possibly a bit late in asking, but is there anyone here who doesn&#39;t have a copy of the rules and wants to look them over before game?<br /><br />Also! I understand that Steve was hoping to get an update out by today, but I&#39;m not sure that&#39;s going to happen. We&#39;ll kind of play it by ear, but I&#39;d <i>lean</i> towards using the updated rules if they come out a reasonable amount of time before game. *World stuff is simple enough that adapting shouldn&#39;t be too much of a problem (and I&#39;m not allowed to prep things anyway, :P).</p>

        <p>I was thinking 3-4 hours. World-gen will take a decent chunk of time, I think, though char-gen is substantially quicker than a lot of other *World games, as it&#39;s more or less based on the assumption that half the party dying in a given session is not something to bat an eye at. Dying is actually how both you and the village advance, so... bear that in mind. You&#39;re genning a bloodline, not an individual.<br /><br />Anyway, yeah, 3-4 hours to try and give all the rules some spotlight time. I&#39;ll send everyone a link to the drive folder.</p>

        <p>Two questions; I&#39;ve got access to the NCFOK backer folder which I&#39;ve read through, but are there other rules I should read? (I&#39;m Fresh From The Spawning Pool, so maybe the higher tiers have them?) Other question- One of my Dungeon World players is hanging around with no plans tonight, do we still have room for another player? (Haven&#39;t asked them yet so they may not be interested, figured I&#39;d check with the GM first.)</p>

        <p>If there are any other rules, I&#39;m not aware of them. I&#39;m pretty sure what&#39;s in the folder is all there is for right now; still beta and all that jazz.<br /><br />And sure, we&#39;ve got room for one more if they&#39;re interested! Even if both they and Matt come, that puts us at five since someone dropped, so that&#39;s a good solid number.</p>

        <p>3-4 hours should be ok, I&#39;ve probably got closer to 3 hours so I will stay as long as I can. Hope that&#39;s alright?</p>

        <p>That&#39;s absolutely alright. We can stitch it up a little early in general if that&#39;s the case; it&#39;s more important for everyone to get to participate and provide feedback than to fill out the timeline I arbitrarily thought up. :P</p>
