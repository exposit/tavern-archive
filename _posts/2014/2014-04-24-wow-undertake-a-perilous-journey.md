Wow Undertake a Perilous Journey can really make your players have a whole different adventure if you let it. Tonight my players fought Gargoyles and found a Dragon underneath a pit that was a tourist attraction and they decided to go on a quest to create an artificial sun so it could wake up fully and they could get its treasure. This was totally not my plan!
