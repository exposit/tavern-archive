<b>The Smile</b><br /><br />First in a series of &quot;heist books&quot; -- compendium classes that I&#39;m going to be trotting out at Origins to run a little scenario called &quot;Temple of One: What&#39;s Yours Is Divine&quot;. It&#39;s about a bunch of monsters teaming up to rob the living daylights out of an interfaith temple of all the sunlover gods.<br /><br />Looking for comments, as it&#39;s a first draft. I&#39;ll be trying to post one a day.

        <p>I&#39;m not sure that I can competently evaluate a new class, but I love the idea of the scenario!</p>
