There was a really cool idea for a class shared over on the story-games forum a while back, The Gunslinger, meant to portray the rugged badasses of spaghetti westerns.<br /><br />Initially i wanted to take the forum post and put it into a legit playbook for personal use (Couldn&#39;t find one anywhere) but once i got started i ended up slowly changing this or that until it was more or less a different version of the class altogether. figured it share my version of the concept here.<br /><br />This is technically the first custom class I&#39;ve ever made (roughly a quarter of the moves are unchanged from the original) so any feedback on potential balance issues, move construction, or simply layout and spelling/grammar correction would be greatly appreciated.

        <p>Since we can&#39;t view it due to permission issues, how is this different from the Spellslinger (which is literally a spaghetti western protagonist with wands instead of guns)?</p>

        <p>ops! sorry &#39;bout that. should be good now. if you still can&quot;t get to it i&#39;ll just make it public.<br /><br />as for alex&#39;s question: I&#39;ve no idea, never heard there was a Spellslinger class- it sounds cool though. for one this class isn&#39;t based on magic in any way so maybe it&#39;ll be a good alternative for Spellslinger in a low magic setting? idk. i&#39;ll have to check out Spellslinger now.</p>
