Is it possible for me to purchase the classes for Pirate World right now? I checked the kickstarter and it said 4 of the 7 classes were completed, the remaining three were to be finished within days. Have all of the classes been completed now? I ask because I&#39;m considering running a game of Razor Coast by Frog God Games and I could use some Pirate themed classes ^_^

        <p>That looks like such a cool setting, but shelling out 40$ for a PDF is a lot.  I assume you are adapting stuff from Pathfinder?  Sadly I have somewhat of an addiction to setting collections.</p>

        <p>It actually comes in a Swords &amp; Wizardry version. This version has been retooled for OSR style of play vs Pathfinder/D&amp;D3.x, on top of stats for S&amp;W. It is very expensive, I agree. At the same time, I think I can do a ton with it. It is supposed to be part setting, part adventure path, and part sandbox.<br /><br />There are four supplements for it, three of which are translated to S&amp;W. The ship combat book apparently didn&#39;t translate well to S&amp;W and it was scrapped. The company said they didn&#39;t feel comfortable putting out the product given their reputation for having high standards for their products. It didn&#39;t make the cut, which is downright horrible. The system is supposed to model Master &amp; Commander style ship battles =(<br /><br />A lot of big names worked on it and the art is supposed to be top notch and plentiful. I even read that Frank Mentzer is even listed as one of the writers for Razor Coast. I can&#39;t imagine I wouldn&#39;t get $40 worth of entertainment out of a 544pg PDF.</p>

        <p>Hi! Sorry for the very slow reply! Classes aren&#39;t finished yet, I&#39;m reworking all of the later ones from scratch after the final draft wasn&#39;t as good as I&#39;d hoped. I&#39;ll be releasing them all as DTRPG books after the project is released to backers, and you can become a project backer too. Should have a late backer page up this weekend!</p>
