I&#39;m definitely setting my next Dungeon World game in the planar city of Dis, jewel of the great Sultana. If you were in my game, what would your character be? What strange culture would they come from?

        <p>I would be a Sol Guard (Paladin, mechanically) from the land of Sarren, a Port City on the Southern Coast with a vast desert full of sand dunes to the North.<br /><br />Sarren thrives as a trade city full of merchants coming and going through the many ships entering and leaving its large port.  While fishing is their only industry their geographic placement make it an ideal spot for ships to embark on their journeys or re-supply.  The region is also home to a unique species of shellfish that stores solar energy on its shell and glows at night; it is also delicious and a popular export.<br /><br />The city is behind enormous walls built in a large circle around the bay and desert.  Large gates are the only two entry points, The North Gate keeps away desert creatures and it&#39;s only opened when groups of people enter and exit the city in their pilgrimage.<br /><br />The South Gate is always open as ships are constantly entering and leaving the city.  They only close it at times of war of peril; its doors are made of stone and iron; a golden sun sits on top of the gate, two copper spears crossed in front of it representing the Sun God Van-Ra.<br /><br />Sol Guards worship Van-Ra in a temple the city is built around; they are fierce, devoted warriors who carry large round shields, two crossed spears placed on top of a mid-day sun adorns them. They normally favor spears in combat, but through the years they have incorporated large scimitars into their training.<br /><br />My character would be Sharad Al-Vander; he&#39;s a 5&#39;10&quot;, medium-build, dark-skinned man wearing a long, dark green hijab, gilded scale armor, a typical Sol-Guard shield and a large, also gilded scimitar to his side. <br /><br />He&#39;s very devoted to Van-Ra but unlike most Sol-Guards he is friendly and has a good sense of humor.  He&#39;s also very trusting and while well trained, inexperienced in combat since he has spent his whole life behind the Sol Temple&#39;s walls.<br /><br />His motivation is to prove himself to The Temple Elders as the final trial of his training.  Sol Guards do this by embarking on a quest with the objective of helping others without any self-gain other than the fulfillment of this task.</p>

        <p>I&#39;d be an Elf Paladin who lost is elvish heritage and forced into human form by the twin demons and my quest would be to regain my true form. It would give me a voice that transcends language.</p>

        <p>I don&#39;t know who I would be, because I was born without a name. I was not born into this world as many of you were. I was summoned. Summoned back from the purgatory where I awaited trial by the Gods for my life&#39;s events.<br /><br />Told that a deal had been brokered for my return, I was given a second life. No recollection of who I was. No memory of where I may have been or what I may have done. Though, these abilities... what I am able to do.. it frightens me.</p>

        <p>I would be Mornn, a Human Druid who was bartered to a mad sect of Druids when he was a child in exchange for the safety of his village. This sect of Druids, The Unburned, are native to the Plains of Red Iron in Hell. Mornn is Born of the Soil, but it&#39;s the black, infernal soil of Hades. He can take the form of the bizarre creatures and minor devils of the Plains. The Unburned do not tolerate deserters or defectors from their ranks. How did Mornn escape them in Hell to arrive at Dis?</p>

        <p>I&#39;d go with a character concept I thought up a while ago, a crossbreed with the body of a minotaur and the head of a sphinx. Quite cross with anyone who mistakes him for a human despite looking exactly like one. A thing for labyrinths and riddles. Native of Dis.</p>

        <p>Valeron Dartanon, a Vorgish Dashing Hero... the Vorg have the upper body of a praying mantis, including the head, but the lower body and arms of a man... though green and bronze hued. He speaks English perfectly despite the mandibles that can chop through scale mail. Recently new to Dis searching for his love that was sold into slavery a year ago. Chased by a clan of wizards that covet his mandibles for the magical powder that can be made from them.</p>

        <p>A wandering mercenary with more knowledge of magic than he should have and a priceless weapon artifact that can instantly change form to become the weapon he needs (eg &quot;a dagger that lengthens into a spear which morphs into a whip which becomes an axe, etc.&quot; Signature weapon with starting tags of Hand, Close, Reach) and probably multiclass Wizard.</p>
