Class Warfare question for <span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink" href="https://plus.google.com/113864117304127544117" oid="113864117304127544117">Johnstone Metzger</a></span> ...<br /><br />Warrior archetypes take a reduction to damage die size and hit points for picking a magician specialty. Some magician specialties also reduce hp or damage die. Is it intended for those to stack?

        <p>Yes! Usually a specialty gives you a damage reduction when it also gives you some similar advantage -- like animal companion gives you a bonus based on Ferocity, but we don&#39;t want the Ranger to outshine the Fighter. But if the Wizard has the same attack and damage scores as the Fighter, why play the Fighter? So it&#39;s possible to make a character that hits both of those areas.<br /><br />Of course, if it seems like too much of a reduction for the custom class you are making, tweak the scores, but I tried to make sure characters would end up more or less balanced.</p>

        <p>Perfect, thanks for clarifying. I asked a similar question before on another thread, but I think I wasn&#39;t as clear in my asking as I intended, so I wasn&#39;t totally sure of the answer. Seriously great book! Thanks for putting all the work into it. </p>
