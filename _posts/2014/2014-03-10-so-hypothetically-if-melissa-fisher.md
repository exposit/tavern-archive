        <p>Off the top of my head, just going with &quot;mummy&quot; cliches:<br />- Grab someone and choke the life from them.<br />- Shrug off blows<br />- Belch forth locusts/scarabs/scorpions<br />- Command the sands, maybe even turn into sands<br />- Relentlessly track down anyone who had violated their tomb, or anything that was stolen from the tomb<br />- Catch fire real easy-like</p>

        <p>Though I think a more interesting question is, what take on &quot;mummy&quot; are you going for?  Shambling bandage-dude? Tomb guardian? Royal person prepared for the afterlife? Royal douchebag cursed with eternal life?</p>

        <p>We got the gear and undead minions. I was considering mummy rot since that is a D&amp;D thing, but any specifics on curses?<br /><br />We got a kind of general one that causes scarabs to burst out of someone, gradually freeze them (if you were a frozen mummy), or make them drown (if you were a bog mummy).</p>

        <p>I would definitely want a move called &quot;Death comes on swift wings&quot; which basically offs whoever I am pissed at.</p>

The backgrounds determine if you were mummified deliberately, frozen, or drowned in a bog. The drives determine if it was an accident, for a purpose, or cursed.<br /><br />With as broad as it is, though, I am thinking that the advanced moves might be problematic (barfing forth scarabs). The basic curse does one thing and can be flavored as you like, so we are trying to think of curses or spells that can be applied to any mummy type.</p>

        <p>Remember to autocurse anyone who disturbs your sleep. Or tomb. Carry your organs in a jar with you. Including your brain. If the jar is not near you gain int and con debilities. You have a royal hareem and servants than were mummified and entombed with you.<br />Think of Moses&#39; plagues: Frogs. Boils. Locusts. Darkness. Disease. Raining fire.</p>

        <p>In that case, I&#39;d definitely go with an &quot;unerring sense towards my prey&quot; thing.  Maybe tie the &quot;prey&quot; into their drive or background?<br /><br />Also, perhaps an aura of despair (another D&amp;D classic).  Maybe they just get the <b>terrifying</b> tag as a move?<br /><br />&quot;Dessication&quot; seems like a good curse/whammy for them to inflict on others, regardless of the source of mummy-dom.<br /><br />&quot;Implacable&quot; is a word that keeps coming to mind. <br /><br />I like <span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink" href="https://plus.google.com/106046847325930212223" oid="106046847325930212223">Seth Bullock</a></span>&#39;s idea, too, but I can&#39;t see how it would work in an entertaining way.  Like, you could just jinx them and they die or suffer misfortune, but it&#39;s not <b>personal</b>.  Maybe if you&#39;ve cursed someone, or they&#39;ve violated your tomb (maybe that&#39;s how they get cursed?), then you can roll that move to appear to them, in person and unprepared? </p>

        <p>Everliving - if the character dies, eventually (not immediately) will come back from the dead.  Resurrection in tact not guaranteed!<br /><br />Communication with the underworld.<br /><br />Fear of cats<br /><br />Drain life</p>

        <p>Don&#39;t forget that if you curse someone to death then their dog/canary has to die at the exact same time that they do wherever it happens to be... (cf Howard Carter and Lord Carnarvon). Or maybe that could be a special separate move: Pet Cemetary.</p>

        <p>Royal mummies are considered to be divine, either descendents of gods or gods themselves. Maybe some inspiration could be drawn from the clerics/priests/Templars</p>
