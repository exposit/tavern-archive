I was musing on a custom move for brewing potions this morning, and I know people have treaded this water with specific classes (Witch, Alchemist, Cultist), and discussions like this one: <a href="https://plus.google.com/u/0/112484087750169360510/posts/aGs9QZCB97u" class="ot-anchor">https://plus.google.com/u/0/112484087750169360510/posts/aGs9QZCB97u</a>, but I wanted to come up with something you could give to an amateur potion-maker. Here&#39;s what I came up with:<br /><br />The quality and potential side-effects of the potion are unknown until it is consumed, and the brewer simply knows they aren&#39;t a master of their craft, and risks ensue. This eliminates the &quot;I brewed a poison by accident, I&#39;ll only dose my enemies&quot; workaround which sneaky players often do.<br /><br />I didn&#39;t want to use the standard range of Success/Partial/Miss wherein it goes ALL right, SEMI-right or ALL-wrong, or choices for the imbiber based on CON because I really wanted a random element for dubious quality brews, hence the percentages for the B and C-grade potions below. Does this method rub anyone the wrong way? How would you achieve this?<br /><br />===MY EXAMPLE:<br />When you add the third eye of the frost-troll to your potion, you create one dose of <b>Stone Skin</b>. When someone drinks the dose, the brewer rolls+INT. On a 10+, the potion was A-grade; +2 armour for an hour. On a 7-9, the B-grade potion could just as easily petrify you for the same duration. On a miss, the C-grade potion has a 50% chance of petrification as above, 25% chance of permanently turning you to stone, but a 25% chance that the +2 armour could last for a whole month! <br />===<br /><br />You could roll a d4 or d100 to determine the outcome, using the lowest numbers as the worst results.

        <p>I am not familiar with the classes, but if I wanted potions to have variable effects I would do what you did with the stoneskin one, with high- and low-quality having you take +1 or -1 forward to the roll respectively. <br /><br />You could also make separate moves for high- and low-quality potions, too, if you wanted a high quality potion to always be better.</p>

        <p>Not a fan of potentially good things happening on a 6- not without an equally horrific hard move happening also.</p>

        <p>I dunno. An insta-kill chance on a potion seems a bit overkill. I have a potions move in my playbook, but crafting high-level potions requires you to procure expensive ingredients first. And if you fail you don&#39;t get a potion at all. You get either a stinkbomb or a bowl of soup :P</p>

        <p>totally get that Matt, but it should come with something like a -1 ongoing to Dex for the month or -1 Cha ongoing for the month... Possibly both if you are giving a +2 to Armor.<br /><br />25% chance for something great happening on a failure is to good a chance to pass up.</p>

        <p>But it&#39;s different I suppose. The gambling seems like an excellent idea though. I&#39;d just keep hammering at a way to use the base roll stats and eliminate extra dice rolls.</p>

        <p>Is it the brewers innate potion ability being tested (INT)? or more the random nature of throwing all the ingredients together and seeing what happens?<br />I would give a +1forward if you follow a previously successful recipe.<br />Maybe if you throw doubles you get the bad effects?<br />snake eyes gets you turned to stone<br />2x2, 2x3 gets you petrified<br />2x4 gets you the armour for an hour but you are also petrified for the duration<br />2x5 gets you +2 Armour for 2 hours<br />Box Cars gets you +2 Armour for a month!</p>

Petrification of any kind also grants the armour bonus, albeit insult to injury.<br /><br />:)</p>

You are unsure about the duration, but the GM will tell you when it expires.<br />*The potion has an adverse side effect. The GM will tell you what it is when you drink it.<br />*The potion is only good for a limited time. When you drink it the GM will tell you if it is still good.<br /><br />Alternatively you could make it so that the 10+ result makes it so that the potion exceeds your expectations, but you will not know what that means until you drink it, 7-9 is normal, and miss has a single flaw (which you might also not know).<br /><br />Simple, and the character has no way of knowing how long the potion is good for, how long it lasts, and/or what side effects it might also impart until they actually <i>try</i> it. </p>
