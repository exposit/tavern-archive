It is complete!!! The class that I have been working on for the last few months is here.<br />I introduce to you the Shadow Hunter.<br />The Shadow Hunter is a dexterity/intelligence based class, that is built around a &quot;daisy chain&quot; style of fighting. It can blink/leap between enemies and deal incredible amounts of burst damage. This does not come without a cost thought. The Shadow Hunter has one of the lowest possible starting hit points that I know of, and has to rely on its evasive abilities in order to survive. Staying hidden is also a necessity to survive outside of combat. The perfect glass cannon. I have been told that this class is quite complicated and I suggest that everyone should first carefully read through the sheet before playing it.<br /><br /> I based this class off of Nightcrawler from the X-Men Marvel comics and also off of Slark the Murloc Nightcrawler from DotA and I must admit it is probably the cheesiest class so far xD. I have a feeling it still has some flaws and is perhaps still too over powered so I am totally open to some constructive criticism. I am planning on publishing it on RPGNow soon and I will post the link soon! If this goes well, this will be the first of many cheesy character sheets.<br />Thanks to everyone who helped me make my first class!

        <p>I would just offer the following bit of critic:<br />Look over one of the official classes and add the things you&#39;re missing.<br />- Add a base damage.<br />- Racial options, can just be human if you like.<br />- Add starting equipment choices.<br />- Add bond choices, stuff like &quot;I will show <i>___</i> not to fear the unknown&quot; etc.<br /><br />Keep up the good work!</p>

        <p>Thanks I really appreciate the help! I have made a rough outline of all those but they still need some work. I first want to see what people think of the abilities so far, and if they are not maybe too over powered.</p>

        <p>I think you are on the right track, but you are not there yet. You don&#39;t seem to have a grasp on the basics of the game. I found a lot of little mechanical problems and spelling mistakes, but I can&#39;t list them all here.<br /><br />You need to get a better understanding of what the moves should be able to do, and try not to be so mechanical. It&#39;s sometimes better that abilities are broad.<br /><br />Keep going and refine it. Lots of potential.</p>
