A few people might remember that I was working on a Fighter variant a while ago (the Peerless Fighter/Armsmaster Fighter). After stalling on it for a few months, I finally figured out what I wanted to do with it, so here it is.<br /><br />The point of the Peerless Fighter was to come up with a Fighter variant that was more about knowing how to use your gear than about being strong or having a special sword, and that had a few more things to do outside of combat. It&#39;s not a completely radical departure from the core Fighter, but there&#39;s more of a focus on the Fighter as a weapon/armour master (Armor Mastery is starting and BBLG and advance, for example, that way the Fighter gets the ability to spend armor points to negate damage as a unique shtick).<br /><br />Major changes compared to the previous version (if anyone remembers it) include ditching Signature Weapon for a weapon style mechanic (which makes a lot more sense re: the &quot;best use of your gear&quot; angle) and tweaking Armor Mastery/getting rid of the +armor moves to try to make him less tough (ran a playtest where the Fighter had 5 armor and was basically invulnerable).<br /><br />I&#39;d love some feedback on the weapon style options (since I feel they&#39;re a bit boring), and if anyone wants to use the class in their game and let me know how Armor Mastery works out for them without the extra +armor moves, that&#39;d be great, thanks!

        <p>I&#39;m playing one in a game right now, and I love it!<br />the changes you&#39;ve made, while not super drastic, have increased the playability of the class in my opinion.</p>

        <p>It also allowed me to put together a concept (in DW) I&#39;ve been wanting to play for about 6 months, so kudos for that as well.</p>

        <p>Regarding making the style &quot;less boring,&quot; you could have them pick 3 options but only use 2 at a time.  So your style might allow you to be <i>deadly</i>, <i>defensive</i>, and <i>overwhelming</i> but at any given time it can only two (for example, <i>deadly</i> and <i>overwhelming</i>). If you want to use <i>defensive</i>, you have to give up one of the other options. <br /><br />Other options:<br /> - <i>Specialized</i> - choose a type of foe (orcs, goblins, dragons, etc.). Against that foe you roll damage twice &amp; take the best roll.<br /> - <i>Fluid</i> - when you roll 12+ to H&amp;S, you may reposition yourself on the battlefield<br />- <i>Focussed</i> - when you H&amp;S, do +1d4 damage forward against that foe.<br />- <i>Mystic</i> - get +magic (<i>if you use my &quot;pick 2 of 3&quot; approach, maybe this counts as both?</i>)</p>

        <p>I like the feel of the signature style, and Death by Teacup is brilliant</p>

I hope the name on Death by Teacup is enough to clue people in as to the intent of the move (it&#39;s to let you do <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtT9BU64z28" class="ot-anchor">Vin Diesel&#39;s &quot;Death By Tea Cup&quot;</a> rather than to let you H&amp;S against dragons).<br /><br /><span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink" href="https://plus.google.com/102595580176380683252" oid="102595580176380683252">Jeremy Strandberg</a></span>: there&#39;s an advance that lets you have an extra enhancement, and the &quot;boring&quot; for me doesn&#39;t come from not having enough choices but from the choices being minor statistical upgrades with very little flavour. Short of making the enhancements mini-moves (that maybe trigger on 12+?) there isn&#39;t much I can do about that, though.</p>
