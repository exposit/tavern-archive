        <p><b><i>Ean Illiam&#39;s Cavern Stores</i></b> takes shape slowly but surely. What does it include thus far?<br /><br />* Portraits for major and minor NPCs.<br />* Interesting questions, such as <i>Why are you going to Ean Illiam&#39;s Cavern Stores?</i>, <i>Why is Mosoud staring so intently at you?</i>, and <i>What made those muddy footprints at the water&#39;s edge?</i><br />* Descriptions and statistics for major and minor characters?<br />* Magic items such as <i>Sohrab&#39;s Ring</i> and <i>Groitzarr&#39;s Vile Menagerie</i>.<br />* Tables to randomly generate NPC types, instincts, knacks, and names.</p>
