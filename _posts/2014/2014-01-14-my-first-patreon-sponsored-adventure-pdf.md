My first Patreon-sponsored adventure PDF, <i>Failspeake Gorge</i>, has just gone online! It&#39;s a free download, so give it a read through and let me know what you think. (And many thanks to my lovely sponsors for helping me make this happen.)

        <p>This is fantastic work <span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink" href="https://plus.google.com/103619294696451727396" oid="103619294696451727396">Joe Banner</a></span>. I will definitely be making use of this in my upcoming campaign. I really like the way you&#39;ve laid everything out. It is a different approach to the Dungeon Starters I&#39;ve been looking at and I like it very much. Thank you so much for sharing! =D</p>

        <p>Oooh, I love the idea of playing as a weak set of characters. It turns DW into a survival game. Or, at least that&#39;s how I plan on running it!</p>
