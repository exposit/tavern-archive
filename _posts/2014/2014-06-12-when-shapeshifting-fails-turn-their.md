Turn their move back on them

In a play by post game, the Druid, played by +Jay Haase had some unlucky rolls transforming from a bear to a falcon. It all went wrong, so I gave him 3 hold, but he couldn't shapeshift again until he spent it, and the moves he had to spend it on were:

-Stumble or move clumsily
-Disgust or dismay another with your hideous form
-Leave yourself open for a devastating attack</a>

        <p>I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever done something like that... give them the ability to still have maximum power of the move, but make the power difficult, entertaining, or even disabling. Definitely keeping this in my toolbox.</p>
