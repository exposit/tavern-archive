I have submitted the pdfs necessary to make <i>Something Stirs in the Blackscale Brakes</i> available in print, and am now moving on to work on updating/preparing <i>If These Stones Could Scream</i>.<br /><br />Same deal as before: if you bought the adventure and did not like something about it, let me know, either here or in a private post.<br /><br /> <a rel="nofollow" class="ot-hashtag" href="https://plus.google.com/s/%23dungeonworld/posts">#dungeonworld</a> Â
