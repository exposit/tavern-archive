Here&#39;s a tiny idea I had ready for last session, but didn&#39;t need to use (because no-one made the mad mage angry)<br />======<br />Gargoyle Compendium Class<br />(when poisoned with stone syrup)<br /><br />When you become a gargoyle, move your DEX and CHA modifiers to your STR and Armour as you see fit. Your DEX and CHA mods then become 0 and you take the SCARRED condition until cured of gargoylism.<br /><br />If you gain a level in gargoyle form, choose one of the following moves:<br /><br />A Stone&#39;s Throw, as the Crow Flies<br /><br />You sprout wings and your DEX returns to normal. Reduce either your strength or armour accordingly, and you fly as easily as you walk.<br /><br />Rock-candy Mountain<br /><br />When you have just bitten someone, roll+CON<br /><br />* On a 10+, they turn to stone.<br />* On a 7-9, your bite transfers gargoylism to the victim; their armour becomes 3 but you take +1 ongoing using DEX to evade them.<br />* On a miss, no effect beyond the damage you dealt.<br /><br />Still as a Statue<br /><br />When you impersonate a statue or rock formation, roll+CON. On a 10+, hold 3. On a 7-9, hold 2. Spend one hold each time an individual or group pass by you to remain convincing.

        <p>Reminds me of Cornelia Funke&#39;s Reckless.</p>

        <p>Would it make more sense to roll+Armor for Still as a Statue? I figure normally it would be CHA, but gargoyles don&#39;t have that.</p>

        <p>Not a bad idea, but I thought poor CON never gets any fun unless poison or breath/rope-holding are involved. I imagine it is like holding your breath to impersonate a statue.</p>

        <p>That could work. But aren&#39;t gargoyles made of stone - how do they have a CON score, anyway?</p>

        <p>These ones are meant to be people under a mild petrification, but still alive. They are a magical, living stone, if you will.</p>

        <p>Got it. That makes sense that they have CON in that case. Sort of like warforged.</p>

        <p>We put the CON in magical CONstruct.</p>
