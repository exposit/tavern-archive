<b>Huuz</b><br /><br /><b>Prosperity</b> Moderate; <b>Population</b> Shrinking; <b>Defenses</b> Guard; <b>Other</b> Blight (rebels), Guild (Imperial Cartographical Society), Need (supplies), Oath (Uhssi&#39;aphu), Trade (Uhssi&#39;aphu)<br /><br />Trouble with local rebels led to the construction of Huuz on the Queen&#39;s Road connecting Uhssi&#39;aphu in the interior through Sazr near the escarpment to  Nussazasuhr on the coast. Huuz is typical of Imperial keeps in frontier regions: sturdy, functional, and ugly. Form follows function, and Huuz stands as a brute reminder of the Empire&#39;s colonial policies. Captain Jirr Ribarkir serves as garrison commander. A veteran of numerous Imperial campaigns, Captain Ribarkir resembles the keep he calls home. He too is sturdy, functional, and ugly. He deserves his reputation for arbitrary cruelty and selfish cunning. Most of Huuz&#39;s guard are experienced soldiers for whom their current duty station is not a reward.<br /><br /><b>Impressions</b><br />* Stout walls of basalt<br />* A sturdy gatehouse facing the Queen&#39;s Road.<br />* Guards atop the walls<br />* Echoes of white water rising from the nearby cañon<br />* Traders coming and going<br />* Native serfs laboring under watchful eyes<br />* The clang of a blacksmith at work<br />* Thick jungle growing to reclaim cleared land
