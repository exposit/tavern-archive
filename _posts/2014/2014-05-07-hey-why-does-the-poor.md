Hey, why does the poor <b>Druid</b> lack choices for what their body looks like? They feature choices for Eyes, Head, and Clothing, but not body type like most others.

        <p>Well you can add what you want depending on the region/world if comfortable with coming up with a few other descriptions. I think those descriptions &amp; names are there for people to quickly make a character to jump in a game (or new to Rpgs &amp; needing a few hints). I always found it odd in the core book, apart from taking up too much word count, why the dwarf, elf, halfling are limited to certain classes.</p>

        <p>Druids are not bound to any form! They change their body so often...</p>

        <p>After our third reboot of DW and reviewing and playing through the standard race/class combos, the party ultimately settled on: halfling ranger (one of a kind, savage and cunning), an elf fighter (forthright and righteous, in a world discriminatory against the pointy-eared ones) and a dwarf thief (tinker/cat burglar with a white beard and a red leather suit of armor)<br /><br />None of the race/class mixes fit, so we made up or borrowed our racial moves, DW style.<br /><br />And as far as the Druid is concerned, I figure that their distinctive feature (present in all forms they take) counts as one of their three descriptors.</p>

        <p>The druid in our campaign usually looked like a bear!</p>

        <p>Actually, perhaps <span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink" href="https://plus.google.com/109359281743079012976" oid="109359281743079012976">John Lewis</a></span> is on to something --- perhaps druids should look like the animal they most commonly shapeshift into...</p>
