Play test is going quite well. Any thoughts on this class?<br /><br />During play test, we didn&#39;t get to see the great ape, though we saw an amazing Super Saiyan transformation. He was fighting a Dragon as he got engulfed in flames. Unfortunately his late was taken; however, he was able to succeed last breath, as a Nephilim ally saved him with Lay on Hands. Through, What Doesn&#39;t Kill You Makes You Stronger, he was able to level. Be added a point to Strength, he was at 17. And in a final charge up, he used Next Time On Dragonball... To increase it once more. Giving him +3. As he leveled, he obtained Super Saiyan at level 2 through Half-Saiyan. And had the modifier prerequisite to transform. He single handedly ended the dragon&#39;s life.<br /><br /><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B9Y6REZIRZw1V19vaGpQX0VFTDQ/edit?usp=sharing" class="ot-anchor">https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B9Y6REZIRZw1V19vaGpQX0VFTDQ/edit?usp=sharing</a>

        <p>It&#39;s a bit munchkin but it does capture the flavor of the series. I feel like it relies an awful lot on plus-one-sy-two-sy stuff which seems sort outside the spirit of DW. Maybe try and frame the abilities a bit more in terms of fictional positioning?</p>
