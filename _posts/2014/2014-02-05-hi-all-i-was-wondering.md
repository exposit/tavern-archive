Hi all, I was wondering under which ability jumping goes: strength, dexterity, both? I wasn&#39;t able to find any clue on the book or in the old forum.<br />Thanks<br />

        <p>It depends on the situation. Are they jumping out of the way of a volley of arrows? Probably dex. Are they jumping to get up something or through something? Probably str. Is there danger? If no, then just say yes and a hard move.</p>

        <p>Maybe it would help to explain the situation: a very big char is running on roof and has to jump to another building. Running on roof could go under &quot;defy danger&quot; with dex but what about jumping to the other building? Defy danger with... In real life jumping is a mix of both.</p>

        <p>The first question in my mind would be is it difficult for them? If its easy and they&#39;ve got a lot of strength, go strength. The second is do they want to land precisely or are they willing to get a face full of roof tiles? To jump from a building and land on your feet requires dexterity, otherwise you&#39;re launching yourself with strength.</p>

        <p>The question I think you need to ask is: what&#39;s the danger, and how are they dealing with it? For example, if the danger&#39;s that the roof is made up of loose tiles &amp; such, it&#39;s probably Dex. If the danger&#39;s the massive distance between the two roofs, it&#39;s most likely Str. Otherwise, don&#39;t have them roll. I know personally, I tend towards Dex to defy danger, simply because my players find it easier to describe how they dodge something.</p>

        <p>If the question is one of covering the distance, Defy Danger with STR.  If the question is making sure you don&#39;t spike yourself on a weathervane or something, use DEX.</p>

        <p>Or charisma if they just look really really good while doing it.</p>

        <p>Ok, clear; thanks everybody. The issue was &quot;i have to cover distance in order to avoid falling down&quot; Maybe a 7-9 could lead to a poor landing with the rrlative damage or other soft move.</p>

        <p>I&#39;ll see your danger of &quot;great distance&quot; and raise with a &quot;Defy danger  INT&quot; calculating the distance then creating a catapult out of various materials on the roof and from my adventuring gear.</p>

        <p>:) not sooo great distance Matt; for an artificer could also work that way!</p>

Most actions in the game that aren&#39;t already moves are codified by the fiction - swimming might be CON or STR. Running the same. Jumping DEX or STR. Or nothing. There may just be no move to be made, there.</p>

        <p>I&#39;m just saying: if the player comes up with a cool way to get over the gap using something completely unexpected, let them roll that.<br /><br />STR, DEX, CON, INT, WIS, CHA aren&#39;t &quot;real&quot; things. They are tools used to challenge the player just enough to be involved and creative. <br /><br />By the time the player comes up with some wacky way to get over the gap, the tools have already done their job. Let the player roll whatever they want.</p>
