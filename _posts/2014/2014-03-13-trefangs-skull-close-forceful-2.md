Trefang’s Skull<br />Close, Forceful, +2 damage, 1 piercing, 4 weight<br />Trefang’s Skull is an incredibly heavy one-handed mace that is made entirely of a dark matte metal that is always cold to the touch. The head of the mace is crafted to look like an human skull (to scale) riddled with spikes, and the shaft crafted to look like a metal impaling spike. The weapon appears to be crafted of a single piece of metal. It has no real handle or grip though, so it is often found with some leather hastily wrapped along the base of the impaling spike shaft. When drenched in the blood of enemies, the eyes of the skull begin to glow a deep necrotic red. And while Trefang’s Skull is in this state, primed with dark power, it can be used by the wielder to request a favor of Death. But once that favor is asked, if Death decides to bestow the favor, the wielder is bound by whatever price Death demands.
