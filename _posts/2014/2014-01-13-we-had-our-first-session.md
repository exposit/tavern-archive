We had our first session yesterday, and I decided to sport some undeads and witness the power of Turn Undead. Many lulz were had.<br /><br /><i>However</i>... Skeletons are labeled as &quot;horde&quot;, so I decided to drag in around 20 of them. After nearly killing two of my three players off, they got a brief respite when they killed a sentient skeleton that commanded them.<br /><br />But guess what, I <i>hate</i> bookkeeping. Skeletons have 7 HP and 1 armor, and it is a rare event that even the darn <i>fighter</i> kills them in one blow. As such, I had to track the HP of around 7 skellies at a time.<br /><br />How do my fellow GMs deal with this? I felt that it quickly got a little arbitrary, since I quickly forgot which skeleton the HP count belonged to.

        <p>I normally jot down 1 heart for every 3 health an enemy has- 2 hearts per skelly in your case (and maybe a cheeky extra heart at the end for the extra 1 HP) so I don&#39;t have as much to fill out. 3, 6 or 9 damage isn&#39;t unlikely for many classes to deal if an enemy has armour 1 and they&#39;re rolling standard damage dice. If in doubt, I mark off a heart - be a fan of the characters and all that. <br /><br />20 skellies would still mean a lot of hearts to jot down though! I&#39;d be inclined to just do it as one big statline. If you forget which skeleton has which, it&#39;s not the end of the world provided you have an overall measure of the horde&#39;s health. (You can describe it in the narrative as certain skeletons going down in one blow, others reforming before the character&#39;s eyes.)</p>

        <p>the one time i did a horde battle i had them have one big pool of HP and when so 10 skeletons would be a 70 hp mob every time it drops by 7, the mob gets smaller </p>

        <p>I use the same system of <span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink" href="https://plus.google.com/109015870893735836823" oid="109015870893735836823">Andrew Murphy</a></span>: One big pool of hp for big mobs.<br /><br />It speeds things up, and give it the sense of the heat of battle.<br />I had a group fighting with a tribe of sea elves pirates that use to perform human sacrifices as ritual. When the party tryed to stop them, they were swarming fiercely.<br /><br />The cool things (opposito to other rpg) us that of this battle I remember what happened, but I don&#39;t have much memories of &quot;numbers&quot;, and it was everything so fast and engaging, even with many differen things happening:<br />-swarming sea elves.<br />-ritual drowning of the victims. <br />-the tide rising (they were on a small rocky island).<br />-ships on fire.<br />the barbarian surrounded by enemies, the warrior making his way to the top hill were cultist were chanting and calling the high tide, and the druid shashifted into a huge amphibious creature...<br /><br />It didn&#39;t took a whole (or half) session or a plethora of dice rolls or notes! It was <i>really</i> happening!﻿<br /><br />EDIT: sorry I just noticed that I went too much off topic, it was enought to say &quot;I use the big hp pool thing&quot;...let&#39;s say I have provided and extensive example of why I use hp pools.</p>

        <p>I usually track them all. I tend to group them in my mind like &quot;the 3 with the fighter&quot; etc. <br />However, most times with horde monsters the individual HP doesn&#39;t matter as much and more if you can kill the one you have problems with right now. <br /><br />I don&#39;t like putting them into 1 big pile of HP because of that. <br />Also remember this H&amp;S move: <br /><br />&quot;If the action that triggers the move could reasonably hurt multiple targets roll once and apply damage to each target (they each get their armor).&quot;</p>

        <p>I split them into groups, and have one half-dead one in each group.  So it&#39;s only keeping track of like three numbers of monsters, and three healths.</p>

        <p>For a horde of 20 skellies I would make them 1 HP each and play them like a 16 hp dragon.</p>

        <p>Depends on the feel you&#39;re going for. I ran a battle against a horde of weak zombies and gave the heroes access to this move (for the duration of the encounter):<br /><br />When you attack the horde in melee, roll + CON. On a 10+ you slay three of the creatures. On a 7 - 9, you slay one creature and the horde attacks you.<br /><br />Nothing super unique but it work out well and the players always enjoy a custom Move. </p>

In John&#39;s case I might only introduce a custom move if the horde was something the group would be encountering regularly that session or in the current front. If this is a one time thing I would go with the big pool or the 16hp dragon approach, depending on what the fiction demanded at the time. Great question <span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink" href="https://plus.google.com/110937611143261107555" oid="110937611143261107555">Kasper Brohus Allerslev</a></span>!</p>

        <p>Custom moves should have the opportunity to be featured more than once!</p>
