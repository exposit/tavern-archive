When you <b>buy a drink from Dooley and pick his brain</b>, roll+CHA.<br /><br />On a 10+ &quot;Listen to me kid, I&#39;ll give you the straight dope about that...&quot;<br /><br />On a 7-9 &quot;I seem to recollect sumpin&#39; about what you&#39;re talking about..&quot;<br /><br />On a 6 or less &quot;Huh?! What?!? BAH! Drink or get out!&quot;

        <p>Huh, reminds me of Tony&#39;s original move from Apoc D&amp;D, which I still use ALL the time, its so genuis for focusing the players on a goal or adventure location or treasure, plus you get to flesh out a contact in town:<br /><br /><i>Adventure Hook</i> (Wis/Cha)<br />Roll this when you meet with someone (shady) who can either hire you to undertake an adventure or <b>provide intelligence of a dangerous locale / valuable treasure ripe for plucking</b>. <br />Roll 7-9 Player chooses 1<br />Roll 10+ Player chooses 2<br /><br />You get a useful map, a guide, or detailed instructions.<br />You know the basic shape of the biggest threat<br />There’s an additional reward or extra-large treasure in it for you.<br />You know the specifics of one threat, danger, or obstacle.</p>
