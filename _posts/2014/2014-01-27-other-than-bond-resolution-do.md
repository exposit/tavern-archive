Other than bond resolution, do your DW games include XP rewards at session end?

        <p>Yep, if the PCs also fulfilled their alignment and answered the End of Session questions.</p>

        <p>Sort of. If I&#39;m running a one-shot, we&#39;ll do XP so the players can see how much XP they earned. For an ongoing campaign, though, I often prefer to do a &quot;level up after the adventure or when story-appropriate&quot; style of advancement.</p>

        <p>I don&#39;t know how I missed those questions when I went looking for them; thanks, Misha. :)</p>

        <p>No problem! Also, don&#39;t forget PCs get to mark XP anytime they trigger a move and miss (6-). With that, I usually have players mark XP on the spot rather than waiting to the end.</p>

        <p>I don&#39;t use any XP except the manual&#39;s methods: End of Session questions (up to 3 per session), Alignment (up to 1 per session), Bond (up to 1 per session), and failed rolls (no limit).</p>

        <p>We do the three questions and I remind them about alignment and bond resolution.</p>

        <p>I&#39;m to the point now, with my Fighter, that i bank more XP at the end of session than i do during gameplay (+3 Dex, +3 Str makes it pretty easy to Hit my way through a session).  And those questions are pretty well designed.  It&#39;s hard for us to play a session where we don&#39;t at least learn something new/interesting about the world.</p>

        <p>I had my Players demand that I, The DM, marked XP once ^^ and I have twice given out one XP for some truly outstanding play. But it is not a thing I do one a regular basis nor is it something my players are counting on. <br />Because Once you start down that dark path, forever will it dominate your destiny in Dungeon World!</p>
