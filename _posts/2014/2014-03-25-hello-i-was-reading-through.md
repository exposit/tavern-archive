Hello, I was reading through the rules for the Hack and Slash example on p57 and I was wondering if anyone could help clarify something for me?<br /><br />Jarl rolls a 11 deal damage and avoids damage, in the paragraph gm deals 4 damage back to Jarl - so how does that happen with an 11 &quot;deal your damage and avoid their attack&quot;.<br /><br />Still on p57 - Jarl &quot;it says here I have a choice.&quot; - what is &quot;it&quot; in this case?<br /><br />Sorry if these are simplistic but I&#39;m not clear.<br /><br />Thanks for listening!

        <p>You can deal +1d6 damage and take damage from the monster on a 10+. That&#39;s the choice.</p>

        <p>Yeah, on a 10+ you can deal your damage and leave it at that, or deal your damage +1d6 but &quot;expose yourself to the enemy&#39;s attack&quot;.</p>
