Does anyone play DW games via live text chat? Combining the rapid response of Hangouts with the text-centric aspect of PbP? Maybe via Hangout chat or Roll20. <br />If this isn&#39;t already a thing, would anyone be interested in trying it out?

        <p>Way back in the day, I got my RPG fix over IRC. I still like it, but it seems to be falling out of favor to Skype/Hangouts.</p>

        <p>Sometimes with story-driven games I appreciate the few extra moments to think before answering :D</p>
