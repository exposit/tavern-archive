Weird question... has anyone tried modifying DW so that it&#39;s skills rather than ability scores?<br /><br />For example, use ability score arrangement for 5 skills, with the &#39;8&#39; being for &#39;everything else&#39; (that is, -1 on rolls involving a skill &#39;you don&#39;t have&#39;).<br /><br />So, you might have Archery and Survival skills that are rolled for a variety of attack, tracking, or discerning moves.

        <p>My first thought is &quot;Almost definitely.&quot; But to take a step back for a moment... what are you trying to accomplish by doing this?</p>

        <p>It might make more sense to call it a Moves as skills system than abilities as skills. Ranger class would have access to skills (moves) that others don&#39;t. All characters would have access to &quot;Everyman Skills&quot; (i.e.: Basic Moves). Maybe something like that?</p>

        <p>Yes, you could make the game more complicated as much as you wish, but... what&#39;s the real advantage in doing so? ?__?</p>

        <p>Would work. I&#39;d love to see a good a skill system written as moves.</p>

        <p>Marty: The goal is stylistic. I&#39;m actually thinking of tweaking DW into a scifi game, and, stylistically, SF embraces a more modernist notion that your character is what you&#39;ve learned, not something innate to you.<br />Having Engineering vs. Intelligence.<br /><br />I mean, I can certainly just keep ability scores and describe them as rolling up a lot of learning, too (it&#39;s not how strong you are but a combination of training and innate physique), but ... style.<br /><br />Mattia: It&#39;s no more complicated to say &#39;Roll Int to Discern Realities on this ancient scroll&#39; than &#39;Roll Occult Lore to Discern Realities on this ancient scroll.&#39;</p>

        <p>Well... my advice is more or less always the same: read Apocalypse World, it has chapters about how to hack it that could help you to make it in the easiest and most effective way possible.<br /><br />Hacking an hack (DW) is less effective than going &quot;to the source&quot; (AW).</p>

Some of the D&amp;Disms in DW should be chucked for a SciFi game, IMHO. (Of course, there&#39;s a lot of sci fi genres, too.<br /><br />In any case, I think that you could accomplish something skill-like by having class-specific attributes to reflect their core competencies. Then base your moves off of those. You would then also need to consider carefully what remaining &quot;core&quot; or universal attributes and moves you would need to reflect your specific genre.</p>

        <p>something simililar has been already done, like in World of Dungeons by john harper. There you stil have stats and also skills, like lore, survival etc.</p>

        <p>Now I just have to figure out, if I go this way with my STL SciFi game, how to work &#39;worlds&#39; into a title for a game where the entire setting is in the Oort Cloud. Um.</p>

        <p>Maybe go with the &quot;roles&quot; idea of Leverage (a Cortex+ game based on the TNT show). Every PC has 5 roles as a stat (Mastermind, Grifter, Hacker, Hitter and Thief). Whenever they are trying to do something fitting one of those roles, that&#39;s the role they roll. (<a href="http://doabarrelroll.co/" class="ot-anchor">http://doabarrelroll.co/</a> Sorry.)</p>

        <p>Looking over AW, it looks like changing the basic stats is, obviously, doable.<br />(Also, I&#39;m glad I encountered DW first, because WOW AW reads like a hipster 80s game. Sex moves, really?)<br /><br />But good comments about moves and skills.<br />I&#39;ll have to think long and hard about what I want to embrace as &#39;what characters are,&#39; what impression to leave players, and what kinds of compatibility I want to leave with different supplements.<br /><br />If I cleave to a more DW-like game, I give people freedom to pulp it up or otherwise tweak it as needed with DW supplements, so that&#39;s a good point.<br /><br />I also speak to a greater familiarity and design ... commonality with a lot of gamers -- people have some idea of what to expect and how to think of Str, Con, Wis, etc.</p>

        <p>I like the idea of roles, but I think it just makes things murky. For example if there is a Captain role, but really it just means leadership, let&#39;s call it leadership instead of making folks figure out whether making breakfast is a Captain action or an Engineer action. I think you could borrow from Fate Accelerated (I can&#39;t remember their terms) if you don&#39;t like the traditional 6 stats. It has modes like flashy, or sneaky, or powerful. That could be a good fit. The difference between opening a door with sneaky and powerful should be pretty clear without opening a book. The difference between opening it with Medic and Marine is not really so clear.</p>

        <p>Btw, it is not up to the GM but the shared created fiction at the table. The GM has very little actual say about what moves you trigger.</p>

        <p>Marshall: I&#39;m tinkering with a more hard SF game, no magic/psi/whatsis.<br /><br />(Though people can certainly ADD it, which is a vote in favor of sticking closer to DW)</p>

        <p>Alternately, you could go even further afield and make roll modifiers based on situation more than stat/skill.  Then make skills a resource you tap to improve rolls.  See the game in the link below for an idea of what I&#39;m talking about.  It uses stats for the tappable resource, but you could replace them with a skill list pretty easily. <br /><br /><a href="https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0B0lFq3ECDQDQdkVSYzYyeFY1OEU&amp;usp=sharing" class="ot-anchor">https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0B0lFq3ECDQDQdkVSYzYyeFY1OEU&amp;usp=sharing</a></p>
