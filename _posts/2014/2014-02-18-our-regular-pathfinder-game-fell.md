Our regular Pathfinder game fell through this past weekend so we decided to play some Dungeon World. Â It&#39;s been a couple months since I read the rulebook so I undoubtedly made some mistakes. We still managed to have a a lot of fun. In fact, we are now considering turning our one session into a campaign. Check it out!

        <p>How did you get that game setup? The split screen and the graphics?</p>

        <p>The overlays are done in Photoshop, the streaming is done with xsplit, and the rolling/mapping is with Roll20.</p>
