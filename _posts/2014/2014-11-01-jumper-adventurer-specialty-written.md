You may spend this hold to instantly teleport back to where you were. <br /><br />Jump of faith <br />You may teleport using bamf, even if you can&#39;t see your target destination, it still needs to be nearby though. Be warned that teleporting into solid objects is bad for your health. <br /><br />Level 6-10 <br /><br />The Gathering<br />Requires Ride Along<br />When you teleport to each of your allies, grab on to them and get you all to safety, roll+CON <br />On a 10+, you are all together and in relative safety. <br />On a 7-9 choose 1 <br />- the place you all arrive at isn&#39;t as safe as you hoped<br />- you take 10 stun damage<br /><br />Gateway<br />When you teleport someone you are touching, <br />If they are willing use bamf and apply the result to them. <br />If they are unwilling, roll+DEX <br />On a 10+ they arrive just where you want them to <br />On a 7-9 choose 1<br />- they arrive someplace different <br />- you need to hold on to them and teleport with<br /><br />The long jump<br />(Requires Leap of faith) <br />You may teleport teleport to a place you are intimately familiar with, like your home, no matter the distance.

        <p>Hmm. This is a neat idea, but you are right in thinking that the moves themselves need a bit of polish. Overall I think you need more 7-9 options for all the main teleporting moves, with perhaps some of them being unintentionally leaving things behind in addition to unintentionally taking things along. Options to take stun damage or -1 forward on a 7-9 also would be fitting, I think, to reflect how jarring/exhausting a teleport can be.<br /><br />I did up a few similar moves for psychic teleporters in a sci-fi hack of sorts than I was running and working on some time ago. The equivalent of your &quot;Bamf&quot; move looked like this:<br /><br />Teleportation<br />When you transport yourself bodily to a another location that you can see, roll +Intuition. On a 10+ you do it, but choose one. On a 7-9 you still do it, but choose two.<br />- The teleport is jarring and harmful - take 1d6 stun damage ignoring armour<br />- You teleport much more or much less matter than you intended.<br />- The teleport is slightly inaccurate, putting you in a spot or in harm&#39;s way<br /><br />(Intuition was the equivalent of Wisdom in the Sci-Fi game, with the reasoning for using it being that psychic powers were all about instinct and willpower)<br /><br />The move is a bit punishing in that it causes at least one unwanted effect even on a 10+, but that was a deliberate choice that I made to make it clear that teleporting in the world we were using was a very difficult and dangerous affair, not to be used lightly. As users of the move leveled up however they would be able to take advanced moves that made teleporting easier and less dangerous. You of course can handle such things in whatever way feels most appropriate for the tone of your game.<br /><br />Anyway, I hope some of that is helpful to you at least a little. I could say more, and even show you more moves but I think I&#39;ve rambled on enough for now. If you&#39;re interested I could show some more of my own teleporter stuff, but I won&#39;t force any more of it on you. xP</p>

        <p>&quot;You don&#39;t teleport something vital with you&quot; sounds like a neat idea but in practise it comes down toÂ <br /><br />&quot;oops, you don&#39;t have your sword&quot; orÂ <br />&quot;ooops, loose 2 of your adventuring gear&quot; or whatever.Â <br />Giving the choice to the player might make it better but still I feel like there are not enough meaningful or interesting choices there.Â <br /><br />Taking -1 forward is kind of a last resort if I don&#39;t come up with anything.Â <br /><br />Thank you for your input though.Â </p>

        <p>I&#39;ve got a player that wanted to play a nightcrawler type and your jumper looks like a good fit. Here&#39;s version of some moves based off stuff from the windwalker and shadow walker, that fits in well.<br /><br />Nothing but air (DEX)<br />When you Jump away from an opponentâ€™s attack, roll +DEX. On a 10+, choose two. On a 7-9, choose one:<br />* You avoid their attack<br />* You teleport away to somewhere they can&#39;t follow you<br />* You taunt them, drawing their full attention<br /><br />Jump Journey (CON)<br />You can teleport long distances that are out of sign. Name your destination and roll+CON. On a 10+, you emerge as close to your intended destination as possible. On a 7-9, the way is long and hard. Choose one:<br />* You bail out early, some distance from your intended destination.<br />* You bring something else out with you when you emerge.<br />* You stick it out and emerge with a debility, the GM will tell you which.<br /><br />World Jump - Advanced 6-10 requiresÂ Jump Journey<br />When you Jump to get anyplace you&#39;ve been to before, automatically. You never need to Undertake a Perilous Journey when traveling by yourself to somewhere you&#39;ve been before, and it takes you no time.</p>
