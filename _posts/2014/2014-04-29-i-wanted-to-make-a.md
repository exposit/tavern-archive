I wanted to make a kind of &#39;magic berserker&quot; class for a while now, and, while I don&#39;t have many advanced moves (yet... hopefully!), I have the starting moves to show and get some feedback.<br /><br />As a side note, I like gimmicks, and stat drain to power moves seemed do-able. Especially since the core rulebook actually has modifier equivalents to scores lower than 8, something that sees little to no play, from my (limited, mind you) experience.

        <p>Having a seventh stat that you can increase by losing INT seems a tad convoluted: can you explain what the class is supposed to do using just fiction and no mechanics?<br /><br />(Kind of related: I am not a fan of gimmicks for gimmick&#39;s sake. I have seen some oddly gimmicky playbooks and they tend to rub me the wrong way. I feel that a playbook &quot;feels&quot; better when the mechanics back up the fiction.)</p>

For instance, it can be magical armor, a blast of energy, or maybe, yes, an actual weapon.﻿ As long as it modifies his body, it should be fair game.</p>

        <p>Huh.  That&#39;s a pretty neat concept, but I agree with David... it&#39;s too much crunch and convolution.<br /><br />My chief concern is that Intelligence drain is just a numeric penalty while sacrificing it grants you a fictional benefit.  There&#39;s nothing that explicitly indicates you become a savage, slavering monster as you lose INT.  Effectively, you just get worse as Spouting Lore and Defying Danger by thinking quickly. <br /><br />I&#39;d probably do it something like this:<br />- You&#39;ve got a variable RAGE modifier (don&#39;t bother with a base stat). By default it&#39;s +0<br />- You can choose to increase your RAGE modifier when certain things happen (take damage, witness violence, maybe another trigger based on your drive or background)<br />- Each time you increase your RAGE, you pick one of the mutations (claws, armor, etc.)<br />- You&#39;ve got an instinct based on your background (drink fresh blood, assert your power over others, terrify others). When presented with an opportunity to indulge, you must roll -RAGE (yes, minus).  On a 10+ you stay in control, on a 7-9 some sort of hard choice, on a miss you indulge wantonly and recklessly.<br /><br />That doesn&#39;t quite get the &quot;convert intellect into a weapon&quot; idea, but it seems to fit more with the types of backgrounds you present.</p>

        <p>Ah, I see. The narrative piece slipped my mind. I&#39;ll take that into account when I can.<br /><br />Edit: As for the damage die, what do you think about having it as a d4 when calm and d10 when enraged?</p>

        <p>You could have a pool of points based on your INT, and have soft/hard move results mean that you get stunned or take -1 forward or ongoing to thinking, restraint, etc.<br /><br />You could also have a Rage stat that starts at 0, when you activate powers you gain Rage, which the GM can spend to penalize you when you take certain actions, or even to force you to take certain actions.<br /><br />If you go this route I would make it so that if using moves causes you to gain Rage that it is not predictable. On a 10+ you might gain 1, but on a 7-9 I would have it be 1d4.<br /><br />You could also have it so that if your Rage = your INT that your personality becomes feral, and you just start lashing out at everything around you for awhile.<br /><br />Fictionally this represents you gradually becoming more savage as you tap into your powers, but over time (when the GM spends Rage) you start to calm down.</p>

        <p>Another thing to try is look at the barbarian &amp; fighter class then change some of the moves with things that mimic mage spells (or steal moves from most video game Rpgs or torchlight2), or figure up some psychic moves for him that mimic other advanced moves.</p>
