<b>The Conjuror, focusing on creating items and creatures from nothing but your magic and imagination.</b><br />This is my very first DW class, so please help refine it.

        <p>Sub. Instinctively I say the creations are too powerful. Almost like a normal character, also with ALL the moves at +CHA (and obviously a Conjuror at the 3rd level will get +3 CHA...). Compare that with the evocated creatures of the Wizard.</p>

        <p>Very interesting idea, but there&#39;s a few problems.<br /><br />1.) Leader seems like the obviously best Specialization... I&#39;d recommend it give you control over 2 Conjurations, not 5. 5 is a HUGE difference.<br /><br />2.) EVERYTHING using +CHA is disgusting. Also, I&#39;m not sure what the flavor is that makes conjuring CHA, and spellcasting INT - aren&#39;t they two different applications of the same magical power? Perhaps Conjuring and Spellcasting require INT, but actually ordering your Conjuration around requires CHA.<br /><br />3.) When you&#39;re playing with magic, you&#39;re always going to want a &#39;safety valve&#39; - and the best valve is a GM move. &#39;Elemental Mastery&#39; is a great reference for magical moves (thanks, Tony Scinta, for pointing that out to me)! Notice that Elemental Mastery will always have a drawback of some sort... this is because you can literally ask of it ANYTHING. So the consequences will have to scale to that request, and if the GM cannot have a say in those consequences, then there&#39;s no possibility of scaling easily.<br /><br />The same problem applies to Conjuration. Notice, you can just try to summon a Godzilla made out of fire to take out your foes. Sure, it&#39;ll only have 10-15 HP or whatever, but it&#39;s still Godzilla sized and made of fire!! That&#39;s why you always need a &#39;safety valve&#39; - when someone makes an exorbitant Conjuration, the GM will have to balance that out.<br /><br />TL;DR: &quot;On a 10+, choose one. On a 7-9, choose two.&quot; <br /><br />4.) This one&#39;s just a suggestion, not an actual criticism, but I recommend you have the miss be dire, just like Elemental Mastery&#39;s is. One, it&#39;ll help balance the power level of conjurations, but two, it also makes for more fun stories. <br /><br />5.) Two of your downside options are REALLY mechanical, which just kinda takes the fun out of it. I recommend generalizing them to be more fictive - instead of specifying what &#39;imperfect&#39; means, leave that open! Instead of saying what &#39;drawing the magic from yourself&#39; is, allow the GM or player to interpret that. Much more fun, and opens up a lot more possibilities.<br /><br />6.) Conjurations should probably only have one skill. Being able to summon a hireling who doesn&#39;t grumble at any time is already strong, no need to buff it up further.<br /><br />7.) Keeping around a conjuration for 3 days seems like a lot - you&#39;re not gonna be rolling to make conjurations that often. I recommend they stick around for a day or so.<br /><br />8.) See, you got the &#39;safety valve&#39; right on Spell Casting! This one&#39;s a VERY minor nitpick - it&#39;s &quot;then choose one&quot;, not &quot;the choose one&quot;. (:<br /><br />9.) Your Enchanter is awesome! - but it&#39;s also really different from the normal enchanter, so I recommend  you change up the name a bit to indicate that. Also, I really wish you had a version of &#39;Enchanter&#39;s Soul&#39; here - where the conjuration gets an amplified effect the first time it uses that enchantment. That&#39;d be even awesomer!<br /><br />10.) &quot;Multiclass Act&quot; is hilarious. Gotta use that from now on.<br /><br />11.) &quot;Spellweaving&quot; and &quot;Perfectly Made&quot; both share the same problem - they remove even MORE &#39;safety valves&#39;. Characters succeeding with ease isn&#39;t actually very fun - it&#39;s only the complications and tribulations that characters overcome that make a game fun. &quot;It&#39;s more fun to slay the dragon than to be the dragon&quot;, you know?<br /><br />12.) &quot;Take Me Instead&quot; could have a simpler wording - just say &quot;When you are about to take lethal damage&quot;.<br /><br />13.) I was okay with &quot;Dual Specialization&quot;, because it opens you up a little bit. But &quot;Master Conjuror&quot; just completely undermines the point of the choice at the beginning. I think it&#39;s best if the class doesn&#39;t have access to the same things every single time, because that encourages more unique archetypes of Conjuror, and helps with &#39;replayability&#39;, you know? It also just feels weird that what seems like an important choice ends up irrelevant.<br /><br />14.) Eldritch Ward is very narrow, but in the correct situation, it&#39;s very strong. I think this is gonna be unfun, because it just vetos a GM move, which are so important to escalation of the scene and keeping the action going. Preventing the GM from acting basically causes a scene to stagnate.<br /><br />15.) &quot;Master of Conjuration&quot; and &quot;Master Conjuror&quot; are way too similar in name. :P<br /><br />15.) &quot;Restore&quot; seems a little OP.</p>

Thank you! The advanced moves were really hard for me. I never honestly wanted to put in that much attention to the scope of this class. That&#39;s why they are kinda... ad hoc.<br /><br />I like the idea of making it more open (the safety valves). Coming from D&amp;D I sometimes find it hard to leave things open. I kept trying to find a way to make spell casting even more painful to use, like forcing a stun or debility upon use.</p>

Even summoning the thing, though honestly INT could work also. I originally had INT there.</p>

        <p>As I&#39;m going for the goal of tiniest nitpick here: Bonds should be worded as if the character was saying it e.g. &quot;I&quot; not &quot;you&quot; :P</p>

        <p>I&#39;m having a DW night right now where one player is this.<br />He has taken the Elsaport move.<br />He has taken the body parts of dead bodies as per &quot;If you have a part of them.&quot; and is teleporting dead bodies on top of their friends.<br /><br />He then teleported with intent to ride the dead body down to the ground. Accidentally switching places with it.<br /><br />I just felt you should know the fuckery that comes with the class you invented.<br />Thanks.</p>

The power isn&#39;t meant to summon huge terrible monsters, and it&#39;s written down as such.<br /><br />Make his head exploded if he summons something he shouldn&#39;t. You&#39;re the DM</p>

        <p>It doesn&#39;t specify too much. And the way he&#39;s done it makes sense.<br />It&#39;s not a 100% serious game but still!</p>
