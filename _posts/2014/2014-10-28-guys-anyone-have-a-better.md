        <p>What about the Wizard&#39;s <b>Ritual</b> move?</p>

        <p>Too experimental. I&#39;m mainly looking for more illusion spells and enchantment spells, tested and proved. That dominate from 7th level is just so bad. And it&#39;s all you get on that way. No suggestion or something like that.</p>

        <p>I don&#39;t know of any &quot;premade&quot; alternate <i>Dungeon World</i> Wizard spells. You might have to break out the elbow grease and grab a <i>Pathfinder</i> or <i>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</i> book.</p>

        <p>I have plenty of those. But I really can&#39;t tell if whatever spells I end up doing become too powerfil for the DW proposal of magic, or on which level to put them...</p>

        <p>The Class Warfare supplement breaks down the core spell lists into 11 different spheres for divine casters and 11 different schools for arcane casters, in addition to adding a boatload of fantastic new spells.</p>

        <p>I&#39;m counting on it having something, but right now one dollar is worth 2,54 brazilian reais, and I&#39;m a college student, so I&#39;ll have to actually save up for it. And that may take at least a month.</p>

        <p>I wouldn&#39;t preclude making/finding/learning new spells during play. At least I certainly hope DMs don&#39;t just limit the spells a wizard gets to those that come from leveling up. A nice additional spell to learn sounds reasonable for potential treasure.</p>

        <p>Nicholas, I have a couple of spells here if you want to look. This is the character sheet for one of my players of my BtW/DW game<br /><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B-I48iZ4PaE5dk82bVNJTnFVM3c/view?usp=sharing" class="ot-anchor">https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B-I48iZ4PaE5dk82bVNJTnFVM3c/view?usp=sharing</a></p>

        <p>Not a big help, probably, but my <i>Fourth World</i> hack adds a few spells among those reorganized from the book. It contains an Illusionist, so I had a go at build some illusion stuff. (The key to illusions in DW is that, because only players roll, a monster &quot;disbelieving&quot; an illusion tends to be either because of fictional positioning or as a GM move triggered by a failed player roll.)</p>

        <p>I wrote up an Illusionist compendium class a while ago that might have some useful things for you. There&#39;s only one new spell per level, but you might be able to repurpose some of the moves.<br /><br /><a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=0Bw6SrgW-L3kDeW1mS1dWZVBmV3c&amp;authuser=0" class="ot-anchor">https://drive.google.com/open?id=0Bw6SrgW-L3kDeW1mS1dWZVBmV3c&amp;authuser=0</a></p>

        <p>I am about to release the first of my specialist wizard classes if that sort of thing interests you. The spells are more open ended moves than they are spells though.</p>
