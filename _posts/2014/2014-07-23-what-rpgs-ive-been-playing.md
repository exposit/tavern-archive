What rpg&#39;s I&#39;ve been playing this year:<br />Castles &amp; Crusades<br />D&amp;D 3.5<br />Dungeon World<br /><br />    With Castles and Crusades my gaming group is playing the Drow Wars Campaign. In this game I am an old Granny which is soo fun to play, such a hoot ( I do an old lady voice when roleplaying her).<br />    For D&amp;D 3.5 my brother is running his own home brew campaign. (This is one of my favorite games along side the one for C&amp;C.) In this game I play a get into trouble, lets fight Barbarian.<br />    And of Course Dungeon World, this is the game I have played the most. We run this game all the time at our Teen RPG Club. It&#39;s such a simple and fun game to play.
