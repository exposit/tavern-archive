        <p>So cool. Thanks for putting this together D! <br /><br />I gotta say, there&#39;s something special about gaming with yall. We gel together pretty darn well.<br /><br />My favorite things:<br />When Brian screams at the top of his lungs &quot;I LOVE THAT!!!&quot; after you share an idea. <br /><br />When Kaillin makes some understated comment, that just so happens to be the best idea ever.<br /><br />When Damian asks for a little time, just to make the brew bitter sweet.<br /><br />Good gaming all around guys! </p>
