Has anyone tried running the Planescape setting with Dungeon World? If so, I&#39;d love to hear stories or any interesting pointers. Apparently Dungeon World has something similar to it, along the lines of Dark Heart of The Dreamer?

        <p>Yes, if you&#39;ve not read it I strongly recommend Dark Heart of the Dreamer by <span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink" href="https://plus.google.com/111694100408744715863" oid="111694100408744715863">J. Walton</a></span> . He calls it a &quot;planar supplement&quot; for DW and cites Planescape as a main influence. (It&#39;s also a very cool read regardless.)<br /><br />There&#39;s a good AP of it online here: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24ihFS7pgVM" class="ot-anchor">Tales from the Planarch Codex</a></p>

        <p>I had a few hours to spare, anyway. Thanks for the time sink. </p>

        <p>I&#39;ve been running Planarch Codex games for a few months now, it&#39;s been a blast.<br /><br />If you have any specific questions, ask away.</p>

        <p>I am running VTT game of DW on Roll20 called Dangerous Doorways which is set in a city called Hub (Sigil) that is has Doors (portals) and factions all similar to Planescape factions but no Lady of Pain, but it also takes some ideas from Star Trek (the Prime Directive idea regarding contamination of worlds, enforced by powerful planar beings based in Hub and an uber-faction called the Wardens).</p>
