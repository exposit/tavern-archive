Hey guys, I&#39;m starting a campaign very soon with some friends and we&#39;re all very lost on ranger pets. Strictly speaking &quot;Ferocity&quot;, &quot;Cunning&quot; and &quot;Instinct&quot;. We&#39;ve been trying to figure out exactly where to look to know what they mean as well as all the strengths you get for &quot;Ferocity&quot; and such.<br />                                   Any help would be appreciated,<br />                                             Three very lost players and an embarrassed DM.

        <p>Everything you need is described under Animal Companion and Command in the Ranger entry. The different stats add to your rolls based on the command you give.</p>

        <p>So, as for the strengths, training, weaknesses, it&#39;s <i>mostly</i> in the fiction, and you&#39;re playing to find out. And the other part is covered in the Ranger &#39;Command&#39; move, where she can add her pets stats to certain rolls.<br /><br />An example of utilizing Cunning: a Ranger is fighting alongside their stalwart wolf, trained to defend her in times of need. The black iron axe of an Orc swings down at her head, and while she would originally take the gruesome 3-damage, her wolf partially intercepts the blow, adding its own armor, and saving her life!<br /><br />An example of utilizing the weakness: if said Ranger rolled 7-9, instead of choosing to deal damage as established,  turn their move back on them! The wolf is cut down its flank while defending her, and because it&#39;s flighty, bolts off into the shadowed woods, howling in pain.</p>

        <p>Those are descriptors that inform the narrative. What happens in the fiction is what triggers moves, so those help form the fiction around your pet. They may provoke or prevent moves from triggering. For instance, a flighty pet might make noise that alerts nearby guards on your failure or partial success; whereas a stealthy one is unlikely to have such fallout from a roll.</p>
