Giving players something they literally can not fight or engage with is not as much fun as it seems. <br /> <a rel="nofollow" class="ot-hashtag" href="https://plus.google.com/s/%23lessonslearned/posts">#lessonslearned</a>   <a rel="nofollow" class="ot-hashtag" href="https://plus.google.com/s/%23absentplayer/posts">#absentplayer</a>  <br /> <a rel="nofollow" class="ot-hashtag" href="https://plus.google.com/s/%23shadows/posts">#shadows</a>

        <p>For me it would depend on the circumstances and context.<br /><br />I ran a short adventure where the characters crawling in some catacombs. The cleric missed when casting a spell, so I had a ghost show up and start hounding them throughout the dungeon.<br /><br />They were unable to hurt it, but they could still run and hide from it (it could not see through the walls or anything). It added some tension and made them think twice before using divine magic since it seemed to be drawn towards it.</p>

        <p>Sorry to be quite so blunt, but as a fan of the characters, why didn&#39;t you suggest it?</p>

        <p>Because my players had a lot of ideas and things they wanted to try out. </p>
