Also, <b>The Cloak</b> is awaiting approval and will also have both forms available for download upon purchase as will all future playbooks. Enjoy!<br /><br />psst.. as a fun little added bonus, anyone who picks up <b>The Damned</b> before <b>The Cloak</b> is approved to list for sale will get <b>The Cloak</b> for free!
