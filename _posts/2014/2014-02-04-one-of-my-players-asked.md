One of my players asked me about changing playbooks from Thief (level 5) to Dashing Hero. I have absolutely no problem with this, but I&#39;m not exactly sure how to handle the transition in terms of moves.<br /><br />Any ideas?

        <p>They are pretty close to the same sans the poison. I&#39;d just let em use the new playbook with out any transitions. It shouldn&#39;t make a big difference in terms of fiction. Just say the hero decided to give up his underhanded tactics and now wants to be more in the spot light.</p>

        <p>There are a variety of ways you could handle it fictionally or you could not bring it up at all. Just swap out the Thief with the DH, both are level 5, and all that changes is the players play style a bit. He could even keep the same name and persona. That is how I would handle it unless the player wanted a brand new persona. In that case, it gets a bit sticky.</p>

        <p>There is likely a better way to do it, with a roll to make, but how about have the player renounce an old thief ally, which perhaps gives this dashing hero a new enemy in the process.<br /><br />...I&#39;d just let them swap playbooks.</p>

        <p>I am a novice in terms of game mechanics, but I would assume that you could either pick moves that correspond between the two playbooks or allow the player to pick new moves that indicate his or her reformed life. I think it creates some opportunities Â for new bonds or fiction as some may not be happy with the new life the character is adopting.</p>

        <p>surely it requires some in game DASHING HEROICS!</p>

        <p>We did this (druid to fighter) and just had him carry over one move from his old life and otherwise start fresh.</p>

        <p>A group I&#39;m a part of did this too, we just swapped him out (Fortune Teller for Charlatan). Then we as a group decided how it could have happened. We threw in some story bits and some flavor, but basically he was faking it the whole time!</p>

        <p>Maybe he gets hit a little too hard next time he roll 6 or under and has a near death experience leading him to see life with a new outlook (and play book)</p>

        <p>You could just swap out the playbooks, but why not swap moves on a case-by-case basis as he gradually transitions into Dashing Hero? As he tries more dashing maneuvers, you swap it out with another move (he foregoes and/or forgets the swapped move).<br /><br />You could restrict this to level ups, or during periods of downtime as he practices new moves, too. Maybe have him find an instructor?</p>
