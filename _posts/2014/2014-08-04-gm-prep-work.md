GM prep work.<br /><br />Given the amount of time this took me, I&#39;m pretty sure I could have made better use of my prep time, but I couldn&#39;t leave it half (or quarter) finished!  My first real attempt at something like this... I&#39;m reasonably pleased.  I learned a lot in the process... we&#39;ll see if I get a chance to put that learning into practice!
