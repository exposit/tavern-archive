The staff seems to have the ability to make brambles, or tree branches that can entangle or trip an opponent.<br /><br />(so the idea here is a staff that can cause things to just get in the way of enemies any suggestion?)<br /><br />A hammer crafted by the lost god of the Dwarfs The Crafter, this hammer was shaped from the first iron ever mined from the world, it has had many owners over the years since, all of them leaders among the dwarfs of the world. <br /><br />(I have no idea what it should do, something fun)

        <p>How about this as a quick idea:<br /><br />Root of the ancient protector (close, weight 2):<br /><br />When you make camp and the staff has direct access to fertile soil and sunlight, hold 3. Hold can be spend to:<br />-cause thin, thorn covered tendrils to sprout from the ground, dealing 1d6 damage to targets in an area (or 1d8 damage if you are in a forest area)<br />-cause thick vines and branches to entangle everyone in an area, making it harder for them to move or attack - reduced movement range and players defending against their attacks get a +1 ongoing (also cut damage done in half if inside a forest), this only works for a short amount of time, about 1 minutes maybe.<br />-grow healing herbs that have to be used immediately or they wither<br />-grow enough edible fruit to feed a single person that have to be used immediately or they wither<br /><br />You may also choose to cause a plant to grow that protects you from a fatal blow, this does not use your hold but will cause the staff to wither and die afterward.<br /><br /><br />Scepter of the first king (close, awkward, weight 2):<br /><br />There is an inscription on the scepters head in an ancient language only the oldest beings are still able to decipher. It reads:“Men shall tremble at the sound of your voice, either in anticipation or fear”<br /><br />When you lead the charge into battle and let out your battlecry, those following you are inspired by your courage and gain +1 on their first roll. Those that oppose you will tremble in fear, making their attacks less effective. In addition, if one of those that followed you into battle were to take his last breath, you may call upon his undying loyalty. This allows him to rejoin the fight with half of his max hp. This only postpones his death though, he will still have to take their last breath once the fight is over or he reaches 0hp a second time. You may only do this once per fight.</p>

        <p>Looks like <span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink" href="https://plus.google.com/101904317061532926939" oid="101904317061532926939">Sebastian W</a></span> beat me to the punch!<br /><br />Even so, here are my thoughts:<br /><br />In the magic item doc I shared with you I have a bow that you should be able to easily reskin as a staff, especially if you use the Bloom-charge tweak. The only thing I would add is that you can spend Bloom in order to create an area of entangling vines.<br /><br />If you want to make it a single-use item, here are some options:<br /><br /><b>Root of the World Tree</b> close, two-handed, 2 weight<br />This gnarled staff is one of the smaller roots taken from the World Tree, which still carries potent life-giving energy. When you plant it in the ground, entangling vines and brambles erupt all around you. Creatures caught in the area take 2d8 damage and are trapped until they manage to somehow escape. Once the staff has been used it whithers and blackens, its energy expended.<br /><br />If you want the staff to be rechargable, you can go with that and do the whole &quot;sun energizes it&quot; bit. You can also add multiple charges, but I would reduce the damage. Actually, you could make the damage something like 1d8, or 2d8 if you are a druid (even limiting it further to just druids that have forest terrain).<br /><br />If you want to just make it a root from the World Tree, or even as a separate item, you can use this:<br /><br /><b>Root of the World Tree</b> 1 use, 0 weight<br />Plant this root in the ground, and dense foliage and trees will instantly sprout up around it. <br /><br />Kind of like an entangling potion.<br /><br /><b>Moradin&#39;s Hammer, the First-Forged</b><br />For the hammer, a quick and dirty fix is to take the Axe of the Conquerer King and call it a hammer: it gives any hirelings in your employ +1 Loyalty.<br /><br />Of course, it does not have to be a weapon, but merely a symbol of authority (so, no damage). If you want to make it a weapon, I would add the Forceful tag. <br /><br />Now, ironically enough, I <i>also</i> put in a magic dwarf hammer in the magic item doc: Mend and Sunder. It is basically a magic hammer that lets you either easily break or quickly fix metal objects.<br /><br />Due to feedback (from <span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink" href="https://plus.google.com/101904317061532926939" oid="101904317061532926939">Sebastian W</a></span>, actually) I removed its capacity as a weapon, but otherwise it seems very much like the kind of hammer the God of Crafting would pack. Again, you can tack on a Loyalty bonus, as well as make it a weapon if you really want that.</p>
