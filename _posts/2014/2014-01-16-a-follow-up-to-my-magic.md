A follow-up to my Magic Card conversion. I created a template, and some basic directions for use. Your milage may vary. Let me know how I can improve it. <br /><br />Right now, if you fill in the table, and nothing bleeds onto a another page, then each cell will be JUST smaller than a magic card when printed out. Perfect for placing in slips or covers.

        <p>Four piles: magic items, monsters, events, and lands. Do these categories account for all possible MTG card types (<a href="http://bit.ly/KkD6iP" class="ot-anchor">http://bit.ly/KkD6iP</a>)?</p>

        <p>I think it&#39;s safe to assume that you&#39;d put things like Artifacts into the ITEMS pile, Enchantments into EVENTS (if applicable) and maybe just drop some of them because they don&#39;t make sense.</p>

        <p>yeah, I&#39;ve actually thought about using enchantments as one-use items. Yeah, my four categories are pretty general. Obviously there are some cards that just won&#39;t translate to a table-top game at all.</p>

        <p>Name a single card <span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink" href="https://plus.google.com/116124411286229550721" oid="116124411286229550721">David Schirduan</a></span> that won&#39;t translate to the table-top very well (dashing hero stance of confidence). Anything can work ^_^. Have you considered trying to make these cards a little more like Magic Cards, worthy of being put in their own slip cases? Something like Magic Set Editor (<a href="http://bit.ly/19xAcmN" class="ot-anchor">http://bit.ly/19xAcmN</a>) can achieve a great deal.</p>

        <p>I love that site and recommend it. I find <a href="http://magiccards.info" class="ot-anchor">magiccards.info</a> has the best card scans online, short of grabbing actual scans from shady sources.</p>

        <p>Your link is broken?<br />Anyhow, I just meant the random feature.<br />Pull out a random card (out of all of them!) and make something cool. :D</p>

        <p>I was just talking about the quality of the site you linked to. I didn&#39;t mean for it to link at all. For those using <span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink" href="https://plus.google.com/116124411286229550721" oid="116124411286229550721">David Schirduan</a></span> Magic Card conversion for cards they do not own, having a reliable place to read and view card art is a necessity. Just showing my love for <a href="http://magiccards.info" class="ot-anchor">http://magiccards.info</a> =P. Link fixed ^_-</p>

        <p>Interesting! Thanks <span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink" href="https://plus.google.com/114124925422808188628" oid="114124925422808188628">Marques Jordan</a></span> for that creator link. I really wanted to create something to go along with your magic cards, not replace them. I contact Wizards of the Coast to see if I could release these cards for sale. I&#39;m thinking about starting a Patreon where I realease 10-20 cards a week. Thoughts?</p>

        <p>And that card creator requires custom art, and the art is the whole reason I started using MTG cards in the first place :)</p>

        <p>Indeed the creator doesn&#39;t interface with magic cards well. It is best used to create a custom card template, supply your own art, text, and then print. I used it to create a few card games and card aides for games I was playing. It is very good at what it does, but very poor when used to duplicate magic cards =P.<br /><br />If you get a reply from Wizards I am sure they will say go ahead, if you leave behind all patented design aspects of magic cards and make no mention of MTG. No relation or reference to MTG terminology, its products, to MTG fans, etc... is unlikely to be allowed. <br /><br />Several years back I tried creating a game that wasn&#39;t magic, not even all that close to magic, but Wizards was a huge opponent due to card design. Ultimately the game was created but only after substantial design changes to the cards themselves. In my experience WOTC guards even the faintest hint of MTG-ness with absolute authority.<br /><br />You could create your own cards. I&#39;d love to see a community supported project that used a standard card template for DW with codified abbreviations for relevant game stats. People could submit their own cards, using art from the public domain or other sources for those that have subscriptions to clip-art websites. Using Magic Set Creator would allow others to change the art easily if they preferred different art for Card X. It could be a cool little project.<br /><br />That template editor is very powerful for creating a card design. The real question is, if you did decide to start making cards, how would you do it? Is it the same premise as your MTG conversion? <br /><br />No matter what I would love to see new cards, MTG inspired or not. The examples you created were awesome and all you did was use the art to inspire a new monster. You could create these cards via such inspiration and nobody would know MTG was involved.  If you can find a way to make some extra cash using the MTG cards approach, while not incurring WOTC&#39;s wrath at the same time, even better =D.<br /><br />Frankly the DW codex doesn&#39;t work for me. There just isn&#39;t enough power available to sift through all of those entries. So any other project that gets me new monsters in a different format, I&#39;m all over it and very excited =D.</p>
