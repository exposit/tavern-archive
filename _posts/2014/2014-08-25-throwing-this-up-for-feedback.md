Throwing this up for feedback. One of my PCs has been complaining about the thief class&#39;s versatility, so I redid it a bit. Tell me what you guys think and if you have any comments or additions that would be appreciated as well. Thanks!<br /><br />Updated with a ton of changes. I still think it needs some work though, and perhaps a rewrite for Trap Expert entirely.

        <p>Dislike the name : Why not rogue?<br />I think the remove traps should be a primary skill.</p>

        <p>Yeah, Rogue is probably a better name you&#39;re right. I just kinda wrote that in there.<br />Remove Traps is important, but I wanted to show some more utility than that and I think moving it to a secondary skill still gives that as an option for those who want it while still giving a bit more customization. That being said, I am going to rewrite Thug and Sneak a bit tomorrow as it&#39;s still a bit bad. The Thug is basically just a stand-in fighter, and the Sneak primary needs to be altered so it&#39;s not stepping on the toes of anything like Defy Danger.</p>

        <p>very perceptive, but I still think the essence of the character is back stab, traps, sneaking...maybe make alchemist a secondary</p>

        <p>hmm maybe. it would work with most of the subclasses actually as an advanced move as well. Something to look at tomorrow morning. Thanks for the feedbck!</p>

        <p>Ah, sorry. I&#39;ve been busy the last couple of days, and I&#39;ve learned quite a bit more about how classes work in the meantime. An update will be going up sometime over the weekend (read Sunday).</p>

        <p>Sorry, a bit late with the update but I think the changes are sound for the most part. I&#39;m having a bit of trouble justifying Trap Expert with a Thug, and the second trickster ability might be a bit overpowered as well.</p>

        <p>I would make thug an advanced move and use disguise as the starter(move down art of). If you really want another combat starter instead why not Underdog? Or a ranged weapon (arrow,sling) bonus? instead of trickster why not:<br /><br />Sly Words<br /><br />When you mislead or confuse others with technically true words, roll + Charisma:<br /><br />On a 10+, they make the assumption you were implying.<br /><br />On a 7-9, they make an assumption, but not exactly the one you were hoping for.<br /><br />6 or less your efforts fail.</p>

        <p>Art of disguise would make sneak&#39;s move a bit pointless/redundant I would think (if you can look like anything, what point is there in sneaking?). That&#39;s also why I threw it in the 6-10 slot for its full form. Also, dropping it in as a starter and then as an advanced move means only one type of character could choose that specific move. Underdog wouldn&#39;t be taken if it was given as the sole option for Thug sadly as it just becomes a really underpowered fighter then (or are you saying in addition to the Thug stuff? I don&#39;t know that might be too much, and again that means taking that option away from the other two). Also, yeah the ranged idea came to mind but it&#39;s pretty much already covered in Ranger for the most part. Maybe if I make it something like Sniper: can use backstab with ranged weapon...<br /><br />Sly Words seems like it would fit better with a Bard though (the idea for the Trickster is kind of a deception master; he is a sleight of hand master but is also very persuasive (think a fool in really old movies)).</p>

        <p>Fair enough, i just don&#39;t like Thug. Sly words was an attempt for a weaker trickster. Maybe a power from the Dishonored or Thief video games? Cat&#39;s grace? Blink? Smoke bomb? Mirror Image? Blur (up armor buff)? Or Thieves&#39; Cant to learn valuable intel?</p>

        <p>Yeah, there is definitely still some cleanup which could be done. The only downside though is the player I was working on it for switched away from a rogue, so it will probably on hold for a bit if not dropped (I&#39;m in the middle of major classwork, hence the slow replies).<br />Anyways, thank you for your help again, and kinda sad this probably isn&#39;t going to be used at least anytime soon, but oh well; onto other projects.</p>
