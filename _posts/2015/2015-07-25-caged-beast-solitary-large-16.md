<br />Caged Beast<br />Solitary, Large, <br />16 hp, 1 armor<br />Claws, (1d8, reach, group)<br />Fangs, (1d10, hand, messy)<br />Tail, (1d6, near, forceful)<br />A saber tooth tiger with tough skin, long fur, and a wicked looking tail. Oh, and it’s also the size of a truck.  <br /><br />Instinct: To free itself, to hunt food, to vent rage<br />•	Rend manacles and destroy the area.<br />•	Terrify or overwhelm a hero. <br />•	Take advantage of size and weapon tags.<br />•	Roar and make a racket: attract attention.
