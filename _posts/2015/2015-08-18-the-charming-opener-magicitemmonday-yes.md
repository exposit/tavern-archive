<b>The Charming Opener</b><br /> <a rel="nofollow" class="ot-hashtag" href="https://plus.google.com/s/%23MagicItemMonday/posts">#MagicItemMonday</a> <br /><br />Yes I know it&#39;s not Monday but enjoy a bit of useful/silly.<br /><br />This is an open palmed right hand made out of brass. From the wrist extends a small protrusion similar to a key. <b>When the hand is inserted into a lock and shook as though greeting an old friend...</b> Roll+CHA. On a 10+ The lock greets you back and opens up for it&#39;s friend. On a 7-9 the lock will ask a question aloud from the Charming and Open Bard move, to which the character must answer honestly. On a 6 or less the lock begins to scream for help.

        <p>Hahaha, so what&#39;s the fictional backstory for this item? What the heck kind of crazy mage came up with a lockpick that&#39;s as likely to get you caught as it is to open the lock you use it in?</p>

        <p>A super charismatic gadgeteer-bard who wanted a lockpick that others couldn&#39;t use. Niche protection.</p>

        <p>I used it to get some characters to admit things aloud to the party they&#39;d rather not...If you want to make it extra evil, on a 6 or less the hand will hold the characters hand in a vice like grip as it screams.</p>
