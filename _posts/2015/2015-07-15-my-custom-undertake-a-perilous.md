My custom Undertake a Perilous Journey move what do you think and what would you change ?<br /><br />Undertake a Perilous Journey<br />When your party undertake a perilous journey, the GM asks one of more of these questions to the group (then a player chosen by the fiction Defy danger):<br />* How  do you evede notice from [adversary]?<br />* How do you pass the [obsticle] without incident?<br />* How do you prevent the risk of [danger]?<br /><br />Adversary is any unwanted encounter with locals like “whatever hides in forest“, “The Jade shadow clan” or “the dreaded black knight”.<br />Obstacles is any hard to bypass barriers in the way like a “mountain range”, “raging river” or “great wall”.<br />Danger is something as mundane and common threat as “Starvation”, “Becoming lost”, “Disease” and “Hypothermia” to uncommon and setting specific threats like “Mutation“ or “Insanity”.
