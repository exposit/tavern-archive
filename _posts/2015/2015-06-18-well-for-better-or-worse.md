Well, for better or worse here it is . . .<br />My first DungeonScapes bundle. This is one is a freebee and I&#39;m putting it out there in hopes of getting some feedback to see what sort of improvements can be made.<br /><br /><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B438R2MBFQ1mdDFkaUNsSF94Qmc/view?usp=sharing" class="ot-anchor">https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B438R2MBFQ1mdDFkaUNsSF94Qmc/view?usp=sharing</a><br /><br />Check it out. See what you think. Tell me how many pennies you think something like this could fetch.<br /><br />Cheers.

        <p>Very tidy looking! You&#39;re going to offer them for sale as PDFs, or do a Patreon or something?</p>

        <p>It looks great! I would gladly pay $4 to 5, up to around $15. (f you keep the cost low you will move more units, I think. I am no expert. Love it!</p>

        <p>Lovely set, man. Really like that goblin. Cave slime and scree moves look good, though I&#39;d probably remove the damage prescriptions from the first option on each of them. Simply saying  &quot;It dissolves your flesh&quot; is more interesting and leaves the fiction more open, I think.</p>

        <p>Also glad you didn&#39;t do too much digital cleanup on them, the images seem well-captured.</p>

        <p>Awesome, AJ :D I love all of it. And just to be that guy, I like the damage being there. I don&#39;t think it does any harm to the fiction to do harm to the character.</p>

        <p>One thing I forgot to do (aside from a thorough proof read - oops) was include a list of questions. You know the kind you typically find in a dungeon-starter. it could probably use a few more monsters.<br />I may go back and add some more material to this bundle based on everyone&#39;s feedback before I make it available via the blog.<br /><br />Embarrassing confession - I dont know how patreon works or how to get started offering PDFs for sale. Any advice?<br /><br />I was thinking 3-5$ might be a good place to start.</p>

        <p>It&#39;s cool. First thing you would need to do is check the DW licence. Do they allow third party products? If so what requirements etc? Once you&#39;ve got all that out of the way the easiest thing to do would be to put it up on rpgnow/druvethru. I haven&#39;t published with them I&#39;m sure they take a cut but all of this info must be on their site. Patreon is more like a subscription agreement with an &quot;artist&quot; to pay some amount in order to get ongoing rewards. It&#39;s committing to continually release work to &quot;backers&quot;. In this case you&#39;ll need to work out a how much $ per post scenario - a lot more involved.</p>

        <p>AJ, your drawings are one of the things I enjoy most about this particular community, and this PDF is no exception. Beautiful work and very clean presentation! I would pay ~$5 for this in PDF, $10 if it was already printed.</p>

        <p>If this was on Patreon I&#39;d drop $3 for each without even thinking twice. For $5, I&#39;d think twice but probably go ahead and opt in. Great stuff!</p>

        <p>The artwork is great and I&#39;d certainly pay $5 for a PDF. If they were in a well-printed book or, better yet, in a collection on hard card-stock, easily $10-15.</p>

        <p>I like the inclusion of location centered moves, good for an on the fly 7-9 roll or just to complicate adventurers lives.<br /><br />Have you tried printing off and laminating some for use at the table? Playing card sized Dungeon Move cards would be great.</p>

        <p>The originals are 5x7 card stock. any smaller and I would think text size becomes an issue. Also, we use little paper tokens to help us keep track of where everyone is on the map-like doodles. It&#39;s like having a battle map without the constraints of a grid.</p>

        <p>After some serious soul searching, I&#39;m still not sure I feel comfortable selling these . . . I mean, I not an artist by profession or anything and these doodles are something I like to do when I have a small window of time. <br />So I am inclined to keep producing DungeonScapes, make them available for free, but figure out a way to ask for donations . . . That way people can decide for themselves whether or not they are worth supporting . . .<br />thoughts?<br />Btw - the next bundle is well underway - lairs, labyrinths &amp; dungeons</p>

But I think you should absolutely sell them. They have value.</p>

        <p>I think pay what you want through Drive Thru RPG would be a way to go. A Patreon account might make you feel obligated to dedicate your free time to it,like a second job which could make it un-fun and pay what you want lets people support you for things you produce at your pace, not for some possible future output.<br /><br />Personally I&#39;m inclined to support whatever option you choose.</p>
