I originally posted this on Reddit and have revised it a fair bit based on feedback but I figure more feedback is better so...<br /><br />So, perhaps foolishly, after running exactly 2 sessions of Dungeon World I have decided to try and create a new class - this is my first attempt.<br /><br />The Ectomancer (with a name blatantly stolen from Jim Butcher) is essentially a Necromancer but without necessarily having all the negative connotations (although depending on the moves you pick you could easily go all-out evil Necromancer).<br /><br />I would love for people to tear it apart since I&#39;ve done no balancing or play testing on it thus far. That goes for the character sheet as well, it&#39;s a little simpler than the normal one but should be basically the same layout - let me know if I&#39;ve messed it up anywhere.

        <p>Kinda sounds like a necroscope</p>

        <p>I&#39;ve not actually read the Necroscope books but based on a brief description the concepts are certainly similar.</p>
