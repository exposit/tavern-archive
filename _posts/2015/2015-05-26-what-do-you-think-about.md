What do you think about moves that <i>combine</i> options that give positive effects with options that avoid negative effects?<br />E.g. When you fight with nun-chukkas, roll +Dex. On a 10+ choose two; on a 7-9 chose one:<br />- Inflict your damage<br />- They lose one weapon<br />- Immobilize one of their limbs<br />- You deflect their attack harmlessly<br /><br />The problem I find with moves like these is that important parts of the move (e.g. exposed to their attack) are buried in options the player may not pick.  That&#39;s not really a problem with basic moves that get used all the time - we all know these moves and what they do.  But what about playbook moves?  IMHO, it&#39;s too easy in the heat of the game to forget there are important details about the way the move works written into unused options.<br /><br /><i>e.g. What should be:</i><br />Player: I roll an 11.  I knock their sword out of their hands and hit them on the follow through for [rolls die] 7 damage - yeah!  But because I didn&#39;t take the &#39;avoid their attack&#39; option I still suffer their attack<br />GM: Ok.  You knock the soldier&#39;s sword flying and batter them to the ground, but not before they get a stab through your guard, take d8 damage. <br />Player: [rolls d8 damage and gets an 8] Ouch!<br />GM: Crystal-Belle, that soldier is down but there&#39;s another one running in and Kaji is wounded. What do you do?<br /><br /><i>can too easily become:</i><br />Player: I roll an 11.  I knock their sword out of their hands and hit them on the follow through for [rolls die] 7 damage - yeah!<br />GM: Ok. You knock the soldier&#39;s sword flying and batter them to the ground.  Crystal-Belle, that soldier is down but there&#39;s another one running in. What do you do?

        <p>Yeah, it&#39;s a thing.  It&#39;s not just because of the combination of good + avoid bad, though.  It&#39;s because the intent isn&#39;t clear before you roll.<br /><br />Also, because the &quot;avoid bad&quot; choice is buried at the end and a little obfuscated in it&#39;s language.<br /><br />Like, change the move above to this and I think it works just fine:<br /><br />When you <b>engage a foe with your whirling nun-chukkas</b>, choose one tactic from the list below and roll +Dex. On a 7+ your tactic is successful.  On a 10+, pick an extra tactic; you get that, too.<br />- Avoid or deflect your foe&#39;s attacks<br />- Inflict your damage<br />- Knock a weapon from their grip<br />- Immobilize one of their limbs</p>

        <p>...and based on that, I just revised a move from my Fox playbook.<br /><br />Was:<br /><i>When you </i><b><i>dodge or parry an attack while unarmed or wielding a precise weapon</i></b><i>, roll +DEX. On a 7-9, choose 1. On a 10+, choose 2.</i><br /> - <i>Dodge or deflect the attack</i><br /> - <i>Change up the distance, closing or disengaging</i><br /> - <i>Deal your damage (if in range)</i><br /><br />Is now:<br /><i>When you </i><b><i>dodge or parry an attack while unarmed or wielding a precise weapon</i></b><i>, roll +DEX. On a 7+, you dodge or deflect the attack. On a 10+, also choose 1.</i><br /> - _Change up the distance, closing or disengaging_<br /> - _Deal your damage (if in range)_</p>

On a 12+ choose two; on a 10+ choose one; on a 7-9 choose one, but you are exposed to their attack:<br />- Inflict your damage<br />- Knock a weapon from their grip<br />- Immobilize one of their limbs</p>

        <p>Hmm, I think that&#39;s an interesting an functional reframing, <span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink" href="https://plus.google.com/102595580176380683252" oid="102595580176380683252">Jeremy Strandberg</a></span> .<br /><br /><span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink" href="https://plus.google.com/106207499701502364297" oid="106207499701502364297">Michael D</a></span> , your revision is also a good solution.<br /><br />I don&#39;t buy that the issue can be generalized to mixing positive and double-negative options, though.<br /><br />What would would lead me into misuse of this move is that the inverse of &quot;you deflect their attack harmlessly&quot; isn&#39;t clear enough at first reading.<br /><br />For avoiding-a-negative options, I think it&#39;s safer to phrase things in terms of &quot;x doesn&#39;t happen.&quot; Like, &quot;you don&#39;t suffer their attack,&quot; in this case would more immediately communicate the consequences of not choosing that option.</p>

        <p>Okay, yeah... I see where you&#39;re coming from.  And I agree that it makes sense as a rule of thumb.<br /><br />I will, however, point out that the outcomes are more limited in your revised version of the nunchuk moves (and my revised Fox move). On a 10+, you no longer have the opportunity to both deal damage <i>and</i> disarm your foe in exchange for taking a hit yourself.  You&#39;re trading flexibility for clarity.<br /><br />I&#39;m fine with that in either of these cases; especially in my Fox move (which is called &quot;Parry &amp; Riposte&quot;).  It&#39;s not in the Fox&#39;s nature to take a hit in order to change distance <i>and</i> do damage, nor does it keep with the moves&#39; name.<br /><br />But now consider this one, from the Blessed (a nature-priest-protector-of-the-wild type):<br /><br /><b>Grasp of Danu</b><br />When you call on the world itself to bind a nearby spirit or a creature of darkness, roll +WIS. *On a 7-9+, choose 1. *On a 10+, choose 2.<br /> - You avoid or prevent their counterattack.<br /> - Roots, vines, and earth restrain them, even if they are insubstantial.<br /> - They take 2d4 damage (ignores armor). If this brings them to 0 hit points, they are pulled into the earth and bound in rune-etched stone. <br /><br />For this move, I&#39;m totally okay with mixing and matching &quot;do good&quot; vs. &quot;avoid bad.&quot;  Making &quot;avoid or prevent counterattack&quot; and automatic on the 10+ removes the opportunity to suffer the foe&#39;s wrath in order to bring them down.  And that idea of sacrifice is pretty important to the class.</p>

        <p><span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink" href="https://plus.google.com/102595580176380683252" oid="102595580176380683252">Jeremy Strandberg</a></span> Following the rule of thumb, I&#39;d revise <b>Grasp of Danu</b> to:<br />When you <b>call on the world itself to bind a nearby spirit or a creature of darkness,</b> roll +WIS. *On a 10+, choose 2.  *On a 7-9+, choose 1 and you draw their attention or attack. <br /> - Roots, vines, and earth hold them in place, even if they are insubstantial.<br /> - Roots, vines, and earth interfere with their powers.<br /> - They take 2d4 damage (ignores armor). If this brings them to 0 hit points, they are pulled into the earth and bound in rune-etched stone. <br /><br />Now the parameters are clear and the GM need apply only the effects of the chosen options.  It&#39;s a small change, but it makes for smoother play (I was going to say &#39;cleaner&#39; play, but that&#39;s probably not the case with this move ;-) )<br /><br />(Interestingly, applying the rule of thumb to the Grasp of Danu move showed up some ambiguity in the original wording. Does &#39;Roots, vines, and earth restrain them&#39; mean hold them in place? Restrain their powers? Or both?  That ambiguity was resolved by the presence of the &#39;Avoid or prevent their counterattack&#39;.  However, having each option be complete in itself is, imho, even better.)</p>

On a 10+ you arrive safely and choose one:<br />- Deal your damage<br />- Your strike knocks one weapon from their hands <br /><b>Fighting Fox</b><br />When you <b>befuddle your opponent with your whirling strikes and blocks</b>, roll +Dex.  On a 7-9, choose 1 but you suffer their attack. On a 10+, you avoid their attack and choose 1. On a 12+, you avoid their attack and both apply. <br /> - Disarm your foe<br /> - Deal your damage<br /><br />Keeping this as a single move:<br /><b>Fox</b><br />When you <b>dodge or parry an attack and strike back while unarmed or wielding a precise weapon,</b> roll +DEX. On a 10+, you may avoid the attack and choose 1, <i>or</i> suffer their attack and choose two.  On a 7-9, you may avoid their attack <i>or</i> suffer their attack and choose one:<br />- Deal your damage<br />- Disarm your opponent<br />- Close to melee or escape out of reach</p>
