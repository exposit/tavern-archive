So ran my second session of DW yesterday, and some folks made it to second level.  Am I reading the rules correctly that the only way to increase HP is via increasing CON?

        <p>You are correct. DW front-loads HP. The HP you have at start is pretty much what you are going to have throughout the game.</p>

        <p>Yup. Stuff that&#39;s dangerous at first level is still dangerous at higher levels. Characters are just better able to handle it. :)</p>

        <p>Better that way, really.  The biggest thing I hate about D&amp;D &amp; its many variations is hit point inflation, and its rather undesirable effect in lengthening combat.</p>

        <p>I am fine with it.  Just didn&#39;t want to be missing something.</p>

        <p>Not CON (modifier) but Constitution (stat)</p>
