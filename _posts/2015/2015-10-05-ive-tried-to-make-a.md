I’ve tried to make a playbook for my <a rel="nofollow" class="ot-hashtag" href="https://plus.google.com/s/%23DungeonWorld/posts">#DungeonWorld</a> <a rel="nofollow" class="ot-hashtag" href="https://plus.google.com/s/%23Mystara/posts">#Mystara</a> campaign. It takes place in <a rel="nofollow" class="ot-hashtag" href="https://plus.google.com/s/%23Karameikos/posts">#Karameikos</a>, and all the characters are Traladareans. They are a people who resemble our worlds Slavs. Traladareans are the native people of the land, but the ruling class are mostly Thyatians who came as traders/colonists ca 100 years ago, or came with Grand Duke Stephan Karameikos’ invasion ca 30 year ago.<br />Halav, Petra and Zirchev are the patron Immortals (gods) of the Traladareans.<br /><br />I would very much like and appreciate your comments.<br /><br /><br />Bogatyr<br />Traladara is no longer a nation, but it is still a people, an idea, a battlecry. The day will come when Traladara again will be proud and free of Thyatian oppression.<br />You are a Traladarean, one of a proud but downtrodden people, and a champion for your clan. If this land had still been Traladara you would have been a noble. But since it is now The Grand Duchy of Karameikos, and there are by and large only Thyatians in possitions of power, you are in a delicate situation. You are a respected knight among Traladareans, but Thyatians see you at best as a poor knight errant, or perhaps more often, as a dangerous rebel, or anything in between.<br />Since the Marilenev upprising there are even one or two Traladarean clans who have turned coat and sided with the Thyatians.<br /><br />What will you choose when you are put to the test?<br /><br />Names<br />Bogumir, Radomirez, Vladimir, Peresvet, Nikita, Svyatoslav<br />Iljana, Nadja, Radmila, Svetlana<br /><br />Look<br />Blue-eyed, Sceptical gaze, Thousand yard stare, Angry eyes<br />Braided hair, Red hair, Pointed helmet, Bristling beard, Shoulderlong hair.<br />Traditional clothes, Travelworn clothes, Once fine clothes<br />Athletic build, Broad shoulders, Well fed, Tall and straight.<br /><br />Stats<br />Maximum HP is 10+Constitution<br />Base damage is d10<br /><br />Starting Moves<br /><br />You are Traladarean, so you start with this move:<br /><br />My fathers uncle’s cousin twice removed<br />Wherever you travel in Karameikos there are someone you are related to who will take you inn and give you shelter and food. Even if there is a warrant out on you. If you stay more than two-three days, or if you bring friends with you, you will be expected to provide a service or gift in return.<br /><br />You start with theese moves<br /><br />My Clan, my Honor<br />You are born into a Traladarean clan. Before Grand Duke Stephan Karameikos came, the largest clans were the proud nobility of Traladara. Now they are reduced to landowning farmers, traders or rebels. Name your clan!<br />It can be one of the large clans (Radu, Torenscu, Marilenev, Sulescu, Nikelnevich, Vandevich, Moubotka, Artho), or one of the many small.<br /><br />Choose two ambitions for your clan:<br />Freedom, Political Power, Wealth, Honor, Land, Safety and stability, Survival, Traladarean independence, Military strenght.<br /><br />Choose one strategy your clan employ to achieve its ambitions:<br />Rebellion, Intrigue, Organized crime, Support the poor and weak, Trade, The Traladarean church, Alliance with the Thyatians, Dark magick.<br /><br />When you go to, or send notice to your clan and ask for help that is in line with your clans ambitions and strategy you will recieve help, one way or another. Roll+Cha. 10+, choose 3, 7-9 choose 2. 6- The gm pick one.<br /><br />-          Bolster, take 3 preparation.

        <p>Ok, maybe I should get the discussion going by telling a little bit about the idea behind and the prosess for this playbook. <br />We have a Dungeon World campaign set in the old basic D&amp;D setting Mystara, and more precisely in the Grand Duchy of Karameikos. The native population in Karameikos are Traladarians. They are based on RW eastern european/slavic peoples. <br />And since the premise for our campaign were that all the characters should be Traladarians, (in some extent or other), I wanted to provide a playbook that tapped into that backgrund material, a playbook that felt more genuinely Traladarean than the other playbooks that are based on the classic rpg tropes. Ideally I would have at least three playbooks that leaned on the RW sources, but you got to start somewhere, so...<br /><br />I have played other rpgs set in medieval eastern europe - ukraine, and I find the time periode and setting interesting. So I knew that in old ukranian, romatic, storytelling tradition there existed this hero figure, a wandering knight - the Bogatyr. And I thought that could be a good model for a playbook.<br /><br />When we come to the mechanical part of making the playbook I had some ideas about giving it moves to draw the setting into the narrative. The move &quot;My Clan, my Honor&quot; is an example of that. <br />One of my worries is that the playbook is a bit of a bastard, in that it takes inspiration from many other playbooks. It is obviously a capable fighter, especially mounted. And it has several advanced moves that simulate the Bogatyrs role as a leader and inspirational figure in combat. The moves &quot;You have a Horse&quot;, and &quot;Warhorse&quot; are obviously inspired by the Ranger animal companion. The &quot;My Clan, my Honor&quot; move is modelled on the Cleric moves &quot;Deity&quot; and &quot;Divine Guidance&quot;, but hopefully different enough to be its own thing. It has a couple of moves taken from the Paladin playbook.<br />So my concern is that it might be too much of a mashup of fighter, paladin, ranger, cleric and bard. It certanly has elements of all those. <br /><br />We haven&#39;t playtested it properly yet, but are in the process of doing so. The other characters, beside from the Bogatyr, are a Ranger and a Bard. So I guess we might see if the Bogatyr steps on the toes of those playbooks.</p>

        <p>Ok, give me one item of criticism on the playbook!<br />What&#39;s the problem with it?</p>
