        <p>Thankfully, in Dungeon World, nothing is &quot;unbalanced&quot; as long as the GM takes care to keep the spotlight moving from player to player. Everyone will have something they are good at, and something they suck at. Everyone will have things they want to do, and putting a hand up at anyone who tries to take spotlight away during someone&#39;s scene is pretty much the main role of the GM.</p>

        <p>I just updated this, actually. The new version was folded into the Lore and Lords pack. It&#39;s on DriveThruRPG for free.</p>
