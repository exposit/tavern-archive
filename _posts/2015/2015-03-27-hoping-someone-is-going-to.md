Hoping someone is going to be starting a Play-by-Post game soon. Having withdrawals but only can do pbp games unfortunately.

        <p>I don&#39;t know if you&#39;ve seen the play-by-Twitter that&#39;s currently running? It&#39;s an interesting format to say the least! <br /><br />Search @tweetsfromDW - you should be able to pick it up from that.</p>

        <p>I&#39;ve been following it now from the beginning, and I must say it seems to work really quite well. You get some of the benefits of the PbP format but it still feels &#39;alive&#39; because it doesn&#39;t slow down a huge amount, and there aren&#39;t great walls of text to wade through.</p>

        <p>Have never tried play by post but am VERY interested because that is all I am able to commit to at the moment. Play by Twitter sounds interesting too!</p>

        <p>If anyone does decide to run a play-by-Twitter, I&#39;d be interested in participating.</p>

        <p>Our Twitter based Dungeon World campaign has 2 openings. The Ranger &amp; Wizard have been taken, but all other DW rulebook classes are available. We just ended our 1st session &amp; it was a huge success! Get in touch w/@TweetsfromDW.</p>

        <p>I would love to, but I&#39;m UK based so timezones will be an issue as they were with your previous UK player. <br /><br />Good luck and happy hunting though!</p>
