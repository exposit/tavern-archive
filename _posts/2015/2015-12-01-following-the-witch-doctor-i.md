Following the witch doctor, I am now working on a Hunter class for Dungeon World. The class somewhat overlaps with the ranger in some aspects but it mainly focuses on hunting a creature in particular, tracking, setting traps and ambushes, and good with bow/crossbow. The base class is finished and ready to receive feedback. Gear and compendium classes will come later on and so far iâ€™ve got ideas for a beast hunter, bounty hunter, vampire hunter, and witch hunter.<br /><br />If you wish to provide feedback, let us know!

        <p>Not a bad idea. It replaces the pet for traps.</p>

        <p>I&#39;ll give it a look after I am done with mine. That way I can compare the two of them and see how some concepts (like traps) differ from one another.</p>
