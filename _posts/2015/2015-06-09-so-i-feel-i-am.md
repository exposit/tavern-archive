So I feel I am misunderstanding the Barbarian class? I can&#39;t see a reason I&#39;d want to play one aside from flavour. <br /><br />In my mind a barbarian is a damage dealer and a causer of chaos. <br /><br />Am I looking at the class from the wrong angle. I hope I am because I really like the flavour and especially the fact they can be whatever race they want ( I like orcs. Sue me)<br />

        <p>Isn&#39;t the flavor why you&#39;d want to play any DW class? The whole &quot;mechanics&quot; part of the game is a direct support of the flavor of the type of game it wants to be and the specific flavors of each class.</p>

        <p>I think they both matter. The thief has some cool moves that are really useful narratively speaking. Like disguise or dirty fighting. I don&#39;t see a whole lot in the barbarian that screams &quot;oh sweet&quot; to me</p>

        <p>The DW Barbarian is quite different from the D&amp;D barbarian, I feel. Damage dealer? Certainly it can be. Causer of Chaos? why not! But it&#39;s less about being a berserker, and more about being Conan.</p>

        <p>The barbarian has plenty of narrative useful moves. It gets a bonus on the dice for persuing its own drives , but doing so also has a reasonable chance of making things more complicated. Some choices in the class make you a well traveled wanderer, some make you an unstoppable force, some make you an immovable brick, some make you a wily cheater. I think it covers the literary barbarian range pretty well. Half of the barbarian advances are about directing the narrative first and all of the other mechanics second. </p>

        <p>Barbarian is a pretty potent class, and they wreak all sort of chaos.<br /><br />The &quot;roll d8+d6 when pursuing your hunger&quot; move means they are <i>often</i> getting the equivalent of +1 ongoing.  And &quot;if the d6 is higher than the d8 there&#39;s fallout&quot; bit generates all sorts of chaos.<br /><br />Plus, every attack they make is <i>forceful</i> and <i>messy</i>.  (Okay, fine, every attack with a weapon, but improvised weapons are still weapons.)<br /><br />Also, a subtle thing, but a thing I&#39;ve definitely seen: when you play the barbarian, there&#39;s a subtle impetus to <i>go big</i> in your actions and behaviors and descriptions. And there&#39;s a general license from the other players to accept that, yeah, sure you wield a goblin as a flail and sweep aside two or three of his cohorts at a go.  Because BARBARIAN.</p>

        <p>You play a Barbarian because...<br /><br />WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR!<br /><br />And when you...<br />- ignore the destruction of your pants<br />- sleep in a coffin; or<br />- use a stone demon phallus, a table leg or a shadow snake as a weapon<br />...you earn XP.<br /><br />And Forceful AND Messy!<br /><br />And every session you learn more about the strange race and culture you came from.<br /><br />And because you can laugh in the face of death (and take +1).<br /><br />But mostly because...<br /><br />WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR!</p>

        <p>What Are You Waiting For is surprisingly excellent. It&#39;s like, I had initially overlooked it a bit, then ended up using it EVERY MOMENT.  </p>

        <p>Herculean Appetites is my favorite move in all of DW. It&#39;s like a mini-adventure generator.</p>
