Robert E. Howard Hero<br /><br />If you travel to Hyboera (or California) and return safely; converse with a tribe of Amazons (or Kennedys) unenslaved but befriended or perform an act of courage even the callous deity Crom(or Arnuld Schwarzenegger) would approve of you may take the following move when you next level up:<br /><br />Lethal Weapon<br />You are never unarmed—your body, and each of your limbs, is a weapon (hand, 0 weight), just as good as any other.<br /><br />Once you&#39;ve taken &quot;Lethal Weapon,&quot; the following moves count as class moves for you. In addition to your normal list of moves you may choose from this list when you level up:<br /><br />Drinking Buddies with the Cast of the Expendables<br />When you share a drink with someone, you may parley with them using CON instead of CHA.<br /><br />Shoot First, Han Solo<br />You’re never caught by surprise. When an enemy would get the drop on you, you get to act first instead.<br /><br />Hellhound on Your Trail, Mr. Oswald<br />Once you have shed someone’s blood, or they have shed yours, you can track them anywhere. No matter where they go you can always find them.<br /><br />Pirates and Thieves are Friends (GOP Fundraiser)<br />When you recruit from a bustling port or a den of thieves, any hirelings you find will take loot, plunder, and pillage as payment, no matter what else they desire.
