I&#39;m addicted to making generators at Abulafia, and have been filling out the Dungeon World category.  Have some random Hirelings, Steadings, Treasures. <br /><br />Also Discoveries, Dangers and (often exceedingly strange) Creatures from Perilous Wilds&#39; tables!

        <p>Very cool. Aside from cosmetic changes, I find it pretty cool</p>

        <p>That&#39;s awesome! There&#39;s another amazing tool called Location Crafter, and in it there are two random word generator charts. One for &quot;descriptions&quot;, and one for &quot;actions&quot;.<br /><br />Each one generates two words, and when you put them together in the context of what&#39;s going on in your adventure, I&#39;ve found, they can inspire really awesome, unexpected ideas!<br /><br />Out of context the words seem pretty random, but if you roll some up and think of &quot;the description of a castle&quot; or &quot;the action an NPC takes&quot; it&#39;s actually really powerful.<br /><br />Anyway, long story short, I&#39;d love an automated generator for those charts! I made them up in Roll20, but they&#39;re stuck in that campaign. If you could add them to Abulafia that would be awesome (I can&#39;t figure out how to add my own... do I have to join or something... it doesn&#39;t seem to be possible)<br /><br /><a href="http://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/141633/The-Location-Crafter" class="ot-anchor">http://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/141633/The-Location-Crafter</a></p>

        <p>Interesting.  It appears to have a normal copyright, so one would need to get permission from the creator to put any of it on Abulafia.<br /><br />FYI there are instructions to get an account to use Abulafia at the bottom of the main page <a href="http://www.random-generator.com/index.php?title=Main_Page" class="ot-anchor">http://www.random-generator.com/index.php?title=Main_Page</a></p>

        <p>Cool, permission shouldn&#39;t be too hard. She maintains a community on Yahoo.<br /><br />I&#39;ll check out the instructions! Thanks =)</p>
