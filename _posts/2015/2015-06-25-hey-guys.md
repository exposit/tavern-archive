Hey guys. I&#39;ve got a player whose character passed away last session coming back as an intelligent gorilla druid. I figure that, as part of his wildshape, he can turn into a human (since they were around where he originates).<br /><br />Anyway, I&#39;m looking to create a good racial ability/move for him. Based on player request/demand, it more or less has to be called &quot;Go Bananas&quot;, and I&#39;m thinking of taking something from the Barbarian, but I&#39;m not sure what the right way to go is. Any ideas?

        <p>I would suggest brachiation, but that&#39;s not really a gorilla thing</p>

        <p>The Samson or A Good Day To Die would seem to be good fits.<br /><br />As an aside, this is a great idea, and sounds like a lot of fun. You should totally have a move named Kreegah Bundolo!</p>

        <p>Me, I&#39;d want a leadership move called Silverback.</p>

        <p>Go Bananas!<br />When a prized item or  tasty snack is taken from you, you go bananas and nothing will stand in your way. Take +1 ongoing against your thief until you have retrieved your item.<br />(not sure how comedic you&#39;re going for)<br /><br />OR:<br /><br />Go Bananas!<br />When someone angers you beyond self-control, roll+(CHA, DEX?). On a 10+, take 3 hold. On a 7-9, take 1. When you encounter a setback that would require you to defy danger before enacting your frenzied monkey wrath, you may spend a hold to defy it as if you had rolled a 10+. On a miss, take -1 ongoing to all defy danger rolls while enacting your fremzied monkey wrath.<br /><br />I&#39;m no move master, but here&#39;s some ideas, I thought it as a fun idea I could look at.</p>

        <p>I realise this is a month old, but in these cases it seems best to ask the player. The player probably had something in mind when creating the character. <br />Alternatively, wikipedia gorilla.</p>
