Thank you, everyone. I GM&#39;d for the first time last night (any game, ever). It went really well. The players loved developing the characters and world through questions. They got really into it. <br /><br />If not for this community, I probably would&#39;ve ran them through some published adventure with a predefined world, or something like that. The first session wouldn&#39;t have received the high praise its received so far.<br /><br />Now let&#39;s hope I can turn what they gave me into a vibrant, living world so that they can live a good story.<br /><br />Thanks!

        <p>I ran SCUP for the first time last night and found the same thing. I&#39;ve seen it in Dungeon World and Apocalypse World but it&#39;s always so exhilarating to see my players active and engaged with the world we all built together. I&#39;m pleased others have that experience, too.</p>
