Here is an idea I came up with when I mixed DW and 13th Age. This was written for my 13th Age Game but I could see it making its way into a DW game easily enough.

Even though I have ran 13th Age a few times my group still struggles with Icons. For those of you who haven't played 13th Age, Icons are the biggest NPC's in the game. They aren't gods, but they ar...

        <p>I would write more specific triggers for each icon instead of a generic &quot;When your character runs into something&quot;, and replace the dice bonus and reroll boons with more &quot;fiction first&quot; choices that let the players have control beyond the immediate situation. I think there is a lot of untapped potential there.</p>
