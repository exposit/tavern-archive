I&#39;ve been working on something for awhile now that I call Dust &amp; Ashes, which is a Dark Tower/Deadlands inspired setting.  Used Class Warfare to create all of the classes except the Gunslinger. That one is based off of the playbook of the same name by Peter Johansen.  All of the playbooks have been tweaked in some way: custom moves, modified moves, renamed moves, etc.<br /><br />I&#39;m looking for comments, suggestions, etc concerning the playbooks at this point.<br /><br />Lemme know what ya&#39;all think!!

        <p>Seems more a Dead lands hack right now than anything else...(Not that there is anything wrong with that!)</p>

        <p>I think the difference is more flavor than anything.  That and the ruins and machines of the previous age...</p>

        <p>The gunslinger one is pretty nice. I tried to do a Roland Playbook once but never got anything I liked; I do like your take. Are you doing a playbook for an ageless wizard too?</p>

        <p>Perhaps as a compendium class or an antagonist.  So far though, the Hexslinger is the only wizardy type.</p>

        <p>Quick glance at it and it looks interesting. I will take a longer look when I can, but am currently sorting through a billion classes to see which ones to let in a DW game this week.<br /><br />However: Gunslinger starting move of Called Shot: I&#39;d suggest putting &quot;Do your damage&quot; as one of the options in 7-9. Can&#39;t hurt to give players the option and let them decide what&#39;s more important. </p>

        <p>I think you missed the last line.  On a 10+, also deal your damage.  Easy to miss especially with as busy as you seem to be ;-}</p>

        <p>Didn&#39;t miss it. I was meaning to add it to the 7-9 options so that when the character hits in that range they have the option of damage or location effect, and in the 10+ they do both as it is now.</p>

        <p>I think it undermines the function of the move.  The player is choosing to give up damage for the possibility of doing something cool.  If you roll high enough, you get the damage back as well.</p>

        <p>I can definitely see that point <span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink" href="https://plus.google.com/105404348444529725299" oid="105404348444529725299">Eld Nathr</a></span>, though personally I don&#39;t think you undermine the move by allowing the player to decide what they think is cooler. They&#39;ll probably choose the hit location option, but you never know. <br /><br />Anyhow, having had a chance to skim through the rest, it definitely looks solid. My wife is excited to try it out.</p>
