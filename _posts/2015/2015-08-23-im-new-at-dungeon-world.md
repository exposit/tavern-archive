Im new at Dungeon World and need some help...<br /><br />Its mostly clarification of the following:<br /><br />1. …Say “take +1 forward.” That means to take +1 to your next move roll (not damage). The bonus can be greater than +1, or even a penalty, like -1. There also might be a condition, such as “take +1 forward to hack and slash,” in which case the bonus applies only to the next time you roll hack and slash, not any other move.<br /><b>unless specified otherwise &quot;take +1 forward&quot; will apply to </b><b><i>any</i></b><b> next move?</b><br /><br />2. …Say “take +1 ongoing.” That means to take +1 to all move rolls (not damage). The bonus can be larger than +1, or it can be a penalty, like -1. There also might be a condition, such as “take +1 ongoing to volley.” An ongoing bonus also says what causes it to end, like “until you dismiss the spell” or “until you atone to your deity.”<br /><b>unless specified otherwise &quot;take +1 forward&quot; will apply to </b><b><i>any</i></b><b> next move?</b><br /><b>if not otherwise specified when does ongoing end</b>?<br /><br />3. <b>STR bonus does NOT affect Damage</b>?<br /><br />4. If multiple creatures attack at once roll the highest damage among them and add +1 damage for each monster beyond the first.<br /><b>does this mean that when multiple monsters attack the one target they always hit and you use the above damage calculation?</b><br /><br />Thats it for now!

        <p>monsters don&#39;t really attack; they do damage as part of H&amp;S. Other than that, sounds about right.</p>

        <p>Unless otherwise specified, +1 forward would apply to any move. But practically, every instance I can think of has a condition. <br /><br />STR doesn&#39;t add to damage by default.</p>

        <p>Welcome to the Tavern!<br />1. Unless otherwise specified, yes.<br />2. Nearly all ongoing bonuses will say what situation it applies to or what causes it to end. If that isn&#39;t stated, use your judgement.<br />3. Nope.<br />4. As <span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink" href="https://plus.google.com/116087077877793003074" oid="116087077877793003074">William Nichols</a></span> says, monsters don&#39;t make attack rolls as in other games; they simply do damage as a result of other things happening (like a 7-9 on a Hack and Slash roll, or because og a GM move). But otherwise, yes. When a group of monsters deals damage, you roll the highest die and add +1 for each creature beyond the first.</p>

        <p>1. Yes. A blanket &quot;take +1 forward&quot; would apply to the next 2d6 roll you make for a move.<br /><br />2. Technically, it doesn&#39;t end. But I can&#39;t think of a single example that doesn&#39;t have some limitation on it.  You could theoretically imagine an advanced move for a class that was something like: *Formidable: Take +1 ongoing to Hack &amp; Slash.&quot; But I&#39;ve never actually seen such a move.<br /><br />3. Correct.  STR is <i>not</i> added to damage.<br /><br />4.  Don&#39;t think of there being attack rolls that &quot;hit&quot; or &quot;miss.&quot;  Think of it as: the GM makes a soft move (&quot;the six goblins rush you as a group, squealing bloody murder, what do you do?&quot;).  <br /><br />If the player does nothing, GM makes a hard move and it&#39;s either deal damage or something else that involves dealing damage (&quot;um, okay, they like plow into you, all stabby stabby. Take d6+5 damage. They&#39;re all over you, you can&#39;t even keep track of them all, stab stab, what do you do?&quot;)<br /><br />If the player tries to dodge, evade, get the hell out of there, etc., they&#39;re probably Defying Danger. 10+ they&#39;re probably free and clear. 6-, hard move (as above).  7-9, maybe you say &quot;you can get clear but one of them gets a stab in, take 1d6 damage&quot; (no damage bonus because I just established it was only one of them dealing it).<br /><br />If the player digs in a Defends against that onrushing horde, they&#39;re gonna take 1d6+5 damage no matter what they roll. But on a hit, they can spend hold to cut the damage in half.<br /><br />If the player howls in glee and wades in swinging, that&#39;s hack &amp; slash. On a 7-9 (or a 10+ if they go for the extra +1d6 damage), I might have them roll their damage and maybe take a goblin out (maybe even 2 or 3 if they roll really high damage). But for the counterattack, yeah, the goblins are doing d6+X damage. Maybe X is all 5 extra goblins. Maybe it&#39;s however many are left standing after the PC&#39;s damage is dealt. Depends a lot on how they narrate their counter attack.  On a miss, though? Yeah, the whole d6+5 and I put them in one helluva spot.</p>

        <p>Monsters automatically deal damage as part of the 7-9 results of a character&#39;s <b>Hack &amp; Slash</b> move. The other time they deal damage is as a result of a GM Move.<br /><br />Players don&#39;t normally get to make the <b>Defend</b> move against damage that comes from a 7-9 result of <b>H&amp;S</b>. Then move covers a short exchange of blows, which is why the player might not take damage on a 10+ result. Players also don&#39;t get to make a <b>Defend</b> move when you deal damage from making a GM Move. It&#39;s too late at that point.<br /><br />Players <i>do</i> get to make the <b>Defend</b> move when they have time to react to the danger. When the GM says &quot;something bad will happen unless you act now&quot;, that&#39;s when <b>Defend</b> is possible. You can defend yourself though.<br /><br />If multiple monsters are fighting against one character, then they get the damage bonus. If multiple monsters are fighting against multiple characters, they don&#39;t get the bonus unless they start ganging up.</p>

        <p>You can definitely <b>Defend</b> yourself. You&#39;re a person, ain&#39;t you?  <br /><br />It&#39;s generally up to the players to track their hold. Some write it down, some use tokens. Often it gets spent quickly enough to not matter.  If I (as GM) give out hold as part of a custom move, I usually hand them some tokens and have them hand them back to me as they get used.<br /><br />The forwards don&#39;t usually need to be tracked. I generally think it&#39;s up to the player to track them, but I remember details like that pretty easily so I&#39;ll often remind my players about them.<br /><br />Ongoing mods... depends on how long they&#39;re likely to go for and what the source/trigger is. Like, when a cleric casts <i>bless</i>, I&#39;d just expect them to remind the beneficiaries to add the bonus.  If I give out a -1 ongoing for some reason, I&#39;ll keep remind the player about (and maybe write it on a notecard).<br /><br />As for fights with multiple foes, you&#39;ve got to really interrogate the fiction and flesh it out, be clear about what&#39;s actually happening. That will usually answer your questions about when to apply the &quot;gang up&quot; damage bonus or not.  3 PCs vs. 3 orcs could be anything from three separate 1-on-1 fights to a single fighter tanking 3 orcs (and the orcs getting +2 damage against him) while the other PCs buff or volley or try desperately to finish the ritual before they&#39;re all overrun.<br /><br />As for how to describe the increased damage roll in the fiction... that&#39;s pretty situational and I bet different GMs do it differently.  Personally, I roll damage for NPCs/monsters and use the result to inform my narration. 1d8+2 damage could be a bunch of glancing blows from different directions or it could be that you&#39;re so distracted by orcs A and B that you leave yourself wide open and C just whallups you.</p>

        <p>Follow the conversation and if they trigger a move, resolve that move. Then make a GM move (soft or hard, as appropriate) that flows from the situation and ask them what they do. Repeat.<br /><br />So, if a half-dozen gobbos are charging and the paladin&#39;s all &quot;I heft my shield and plant my feet, bracing for impact&quot; they just triggered <b>Defend</b>.  Roll it. They get a 7-9, or 1 hold.  They didn&#39;t do anything to stop the charging goblins, so that&#39;s a hard move: deal damage and describe them stabbing and swarming. They spend their 1 hold to halve the damage. They&#39;ve got goblins all around. &quot;What do you do?&quot;  <br /><br />If they keep turtling and triggering <b>Defend</b> in that case, you&#39;ve got every right to deal more damage or make even harder moves (capture them, for example).  But probably, the paladin&#39;s gonna start swinging. <i>That</i> trigger&#39;s <b>Hack and Slash</b>.  Now resolve <i>that</i> and describe the outcome and make a move and ask what happens.    </p>

        <p>Deal damage is a GM move all on its own. When there&#39;s an appropriate threat nearby, and it makes sense to, you can either threaten damage as a soft move and offer the player an opportunity to avoid or mitigate the threat, or you can make a hard move, and hit them with the damage. <br /><br />The rules for hack and slash says the enemy makes an <b>attack</b> this can and often does involve damage, but can also include other complications like tripping or grappling the character. If you deal damage as a result of hack and slash, resolve that first, and then ask the player &quot;what do you do?&quot;<br /><br />While monsters don&#39;t roll, they do act without waiting for players to fail a roll. Look to their moves, think about what they want, and have them behave proactively accordingly. Say what the monsters are doing and ask the players &quot;what do you do?&quot; If the players ignore the monster, their action comes to bear, with all the consequences that follow.</p>
