Hi everyone, my name is Kevin. And I am looking to join a group playing Dungeon World online. I have experience playing/DMing it already, and would love to get involved again. I live in the US in the Central time zone. I would prefer an experienced DM, and a group with a small amount of players (Max 4). However an inexperienced DM is fine as long as gameplay doesn&#39;t take forever. I have no problem adapting to a current group, but would prefer a new adventure. <br /><br />If there are any questions about me feel free to ask.

        <p>I would definitely be interested in playing if we could find a time that suits everyone. I&#39;m currently running a game, though, so I&#39;m not looking to run anything. :(</p>
