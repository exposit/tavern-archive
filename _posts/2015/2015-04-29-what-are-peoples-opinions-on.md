What are peoples opinions on the Battlemaster from Grimworld.Â <br /><br />I think he looks pretty awesome. Does anyone have any cool experiances from playing one they could share?

        <p>I run an intermittent Grim World campaign.  One of my groups plays a Battlemaster.  He has a lot of fun with it, and it&#39;s always entertaining to see him bend terrible situations into advantageous ones.<br /><br />Some nice spends of Gambit from him have been:<br /><br />-leading one group of enemies into another group of enemies, saving the party&#39;s collective hide and giving them the opportunity to make off with the loot.<br />-waiting till just the right moment for a blizzard to strike to lead the group away from a small army to relative safety<br />-using Gambit to pass his Final Breath roll because luring the demon sow in close was all part of the plan.<br /><br />These moments were a lot more exciting in play ;)<br /><br />I really like the Battlemaster, and would definitely recommend reading advice provided in Grim World or offer it to the GM to read to get the most out of this class.<br /><br /><br /><br /></p>

        <p>I would like to test the class because I fear some of the gambits might break the fiction a bit. Also half your class features are turned off if people don&#39;t fail moves. <br />You want failed moves in your game but encouraging them like this seems like weird class design to me.</p>
