So, i have made a few custom classes, mostly with the Class Warfare playbook, i would like to know what you guys think. I&#39;ve been told that most of them are overpowered, but i can&#39;t see it. Could you guys please explain why they&#39;re overpowered/ how i could fix it?

        <p>They&#39;re probably tagging it to remind themselves to view it later... like I&#39;m doing right now.</p>

        <p>Haven&#39;t had a chance to read them all, but only way they could be overpowered if a class can hog the spotlight and over shadow all the other characters. Otherwise don&#39;t worry about it</p>
