The recent update for SW shows the Kobold race. Along with this I have been working on a Kobold steading. Here is a partial preview:<br /><br /><b>Insel-yan Hausern</b> (Roaming City)<br />A large dead tree floating in the astral, home to a powerful dryad. The tree is surrounded by kobold homes, rocks, ships, shrines, and abodes. Inside lies the heartwood.<br /><br /><b>Steading Tags</b><br />Prosperity: Moderate<br />Population: Shrinking<br />Denizens: Spirits (mostly Kobolds)<br /><br /><b>Impressions</b><br />-Road sized branches<br />-Random types of ships, islands, and rocks all around<br />-Lush greenery with patches of pale wood<br /><br />Cast<br /><b>Enrica</b> is a dryad who inhabits the dead tree. Early kobolds found her drifting through the astral sea on the brink of death. With their support, brought life back to her and the surface of her tree.<br /><br />Places<br /><b>The Snarl</b> is Enrica’s home. It’s entrance is a large knot along the top of the tree. <br /><b>Pithy Square</b> runs up and down the heartwood inside the tree. It is a trading square and the higher one goes the more expensive the goods get.<br /><b>Tevoda Shrine</b> lies on the large branch near the center of the tree. Spirits and other creatures can go there to pay tribute to Enrica.<br /><br /><br />I also want to create an adventure front featuring an island owned by a powerful person who collects astral beasts and rare creatures found in SW. :D
