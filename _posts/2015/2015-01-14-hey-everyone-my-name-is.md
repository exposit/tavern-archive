Hey everyone my name is Perry And I am looking to join in on the Dungeon World fun. I have never played before. I would like if someone could show me the ropes and help me out. other than that I would be very happy to maybe play weekly with some people and eventually (after a few sessions hopefully) become good enough to not need help. Thank you!

        <p>I would encourage you to read this:<br /><a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/3269630/dwdotcom/eon-guide/Dungeon%20World%20Guide%20pdf%20version%201.2.pdf" class="ot-anchor">https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/3269630/dwdotcom/eon-guide/Dungeon%20World%20Guide%20pdf%20version%201.2.pdf</a><br />It was the first thing I read after the core book and it helped a ton.</p>

        <p>Perry, check out Roll20 - there&#39;s a DW group on there that&#39;s just pick up games. If it will work with your schedule and you are OK with online gaming, it&#39;s a good way to get to try out the game</p>
