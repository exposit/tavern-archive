Out of curiosity, does anyone have any experiences with Funnel World they&#39;d care to share? <br />Having finally got around to reading The Hunger Games, I&#39;m playing around in my head with making a similarly-styled Funnel adventure, but just want to take the Tavern&#39;s advice on whether this could work.

        <p>Haven&#39;t updated it in a while, but this is my experience with a funnel world. <a href="https://notthatkindofdungeon.wordpress.com/tales-of-hornden/" class="ot-anchor">https://notthatkindofdungeon.wordpress.com/tales-of-hornden/</a><br /><br />It was a blast! <span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink" href="https://plus.google.com/109840962456887986459" oid="109840962456887986459">Andrew Fish</a></span>​ was an awesome GM and it was a really compelling adventure.</p>

        <p>Thanks <span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink" href="https://plus.google.com/102592242114005044951" oid="102592242114005044951">Michael Kennedy</a></span> !<br /><br />Funnel World was a blast to run.  I have started two funnels.  The first was based on one of the samples in the book (something about the dog men), and <span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink" href="https://plus.google.com/102592242114005044951" oid="102592242114005044951">Michael Kennedy</a></span> and another friend each played four villagers.<br /><br />We followed the published rules for character creation and ended up with a motley cast of eight villagers with some interesting qualities and bonds already developed.<br /><br />We then developed the village using the published rules, and the system lent to a quick development of just enough points to build from without going into much detail. <br /><br />Both villager creation and village creation were well designed, and fun.<br /><br />Then we got into the game.  The quirks and bonds came to light almost immediately, and we had a blast watching them scramble out of harms way.  After a few deaths, we got a a point where we paused to roll up a couple more villagers who the main party rescued, and we kept rolling.  By the end of the session, we had a compelling story moving along, and it was fun.<br /><br />We stopped that story after the first session, however, because we added two new players, including Michael&#39;s 12 year old son, who had never played an RPG.  We wanted to create a new cast and village, and went through the process again.  <br /><br />The published systems worked well again, and Michael&#39;s son was able to quickly get into it along with us old folks.  We gave each player three characters, and a cast of twelve proved a little tough to keep track of.  As they died off, we reduced the threshold to two characters per player, and at some point where a couple players were running low, we found some folks to rescue.<br /><br />This time i had written my own starter.  Within five minutes, we were way off course from what i anticipated (always a great thing in DW!), and had a helluva good time running around like an episode of Scooby Doo. Again, we got some compelling story out of the session, and we returned for a second session to finish the funnel.<br /><br />At the end of the funnel, the village was saved and each player converted a villager to a DW Playbook, and we had some good times exploring those characters and their village.<br /><br />I think the one thing i&#39;d look to adjust in Funnel World is a way that you could level a villager, without hitting a full Level 1 Playbook.  Just something to let them burn a little XP and get a little distinction while in the Funnel still.  There have been some interesting proposals online, though i haven&#39;t ready them recently.<br /><br />The two things i loved the most about the Funnel World rules were the villager and village generation.  I have used the villager generator to make NPCs on the spot a few times in DW, with great fun.  And the village generator has helped me rethink how towns spontaneously pop up around a resource, helping me ask better questions in DW as we get to a new place and need to find out what&#39;s there.<br /><br />Happy Funnel-ing!</p>

        <p>+1 for Funnel World. I&#39;ve run a few games and each time it&#39;s been a hell of a lot of fun. Brilliant for getting players to celebrate the bad luck as well as the good.<br /><br />My advice would be get some index cards with each players characters names written on and then do a quick relationship map with the group at the beginning so you can have it accessible during play. (Names can get confusing pretty quick - until the deaths start rolling in of course).<br /><br />Hunger Games sounds interesting, would it be more PvP focused?</p>

        <p>Player(s) would roll up X number of their own controllable characters, and be forced to compete against a larger pool of GM generated NPCs using the same tables as the PCs. <br /><br />In my head I&#39;m tinkering with whether PCs must choose one of their characters to play as unto death, at which point they can assume the role of the next of their characters. Possibly I&#39;d look at tying the luck Luck resource as a means of changing to one of their other characters prematurely, but we&#39;ll see. I need to get it all down on paper first :P</p>
