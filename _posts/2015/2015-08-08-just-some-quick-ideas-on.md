Let me lay this straight, in Dungeons and Dragons, high level means even more power to do harm and take what you want. More or less. I'm not writing an essay here.

At the end, when you hit that power level I think the campaign would be become more of a resource management thing of directing civilization and grooming future heroes.Â </p>

        <p>Yeah I&#39;ll scan over it later and turn them into more robust Moves, but the general idea is rather than gaining new abilities the heroes can ride on what they already are and the things they have accomplished. I basically fancy the players becoming Obi-Wans and Fisher Kings.</p>
