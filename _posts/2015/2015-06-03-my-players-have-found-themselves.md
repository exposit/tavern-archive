My players have found themselves embroiled in a courtly trial which will decide whether or not the crown prince is guilty of faking the murder of his sister and hiding her away for a decade to keep her knowledge of his war-crimes secret. if he is, his nephew (aged 8) will take the crown instead. the players are going to be investigating witnesses and information from a decade old crime.   <br /><br />Very fortunately, they are torn about the outcome they want. Finding discern realities/spout lore a bit broad for my specific purposes, I drafted the following - any feedback would help:<br /><br /><b>When you question someone to uncover the truth before the court</b>, describe your method of questioning and Roll + the appropriate STAT. On a 10+ your questioning reveals a piece of factual information or uncovers some lie – additionally, the DM will indicate how the information applies to the greater puzzle or illuminates its implications. One a 7-9 you uncover a fact or root out a lie, but it is up to you to uncover its significance. On a miss, your questioning uncovers two things: two truths, two lies, or some combination of both. One of these is accurate, the other is not.

        <p>I feel like it&#39;s too removed from the fiction &amp; dialog that will actually take place.  <br /><br />I&#39;d recommend a few different moves that reflect the approach their taking.  Like...<br /><br />When you <b>carefully study someone under questioning</b>, roll +WIS. On a 10+ hold 3, on a 7-9, hold 2. While they are being questioned, spend hold 1 for 1 to ask one of the following and get an honest answer:<br /> - Are they telling the truth?<br /> - Are they hiding something?<br /> - What are they really feeling?<br /> - What would it take to get them to __?<br /> - What are they hoping for?<br />On a miss, ask one question now and get an honest answer, but their player can ask you a question, too. Answer honestly.  Regardless of your roll, you can&#39;t use this again on the same person in the same situation.<br /><br />When you <b>make accusation, directly and in public, but without concrete proof</b>, roll +CHA. On a 10+, they pick 1. <br />  - Respond honestly and forthrightly<br />  - Resort to hostility (name calling, counter-accusations, demands for duels, etc.)<br />On a 7-9, they can pick one of the above or 1 of these instead:<br />  - Return your accusations with stony silence<br />  - Dissemble, split hairs, make excuses, give alibis, or otherwise weasel about<br />Regardless of their response, making the same accusation again without proof has no effect other than to make you look like a bully or a fool.<br /><br />When you <b>think you&#39;ve made a connection</b>, tell the GM what you&#39;re thinking and roll +INT. *On a 7+, the GM will either confirm your suspicions or point out the flow in your logic. *On a 10+, they&#39;ll also point out an additional, useful piece of information.  *On a miss, the GM is under no obligation to reply.</p>

        <p>&quot;additionally, the DM will indicate how the information applies to the greater puzzle or illuminates its implications.&quot;<br /><br />I wouldn&#39;t do this. Let the players figure it out themselves. There is no &quot;mystery&quot; for them to solve if you do most of the heavy lifting for them. They will enjoy it more if they put the pieces together themselves.<br /><br />Also the 7-9 result should have an aspect of uncertainty to it maybe cast doubt or create suspicion about the result in some way.<br /><br />Also do you as GM know the &quot;facts&quot; of the case or are they sort of being improved on the fly by how the questions are asked or answered?<br /><br />-But yes I agree a custom move is the way to go in this situation! Thanks for sharing!</p>

        <p>Thank you for the response, <span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink" href="https://plus.google.com/102595580176380683252" oid="102595580176380683252">Jeremy Strandberg</a></span>! Your suggested moves are a definite improvement to my original idea, which was admittedly shot from the hip. I particularly like your move with respect to questioning and am 100% going to adapt it. I do think defy danger can do a lot of the legwork that the second one covers. I&#39;m a big fan of the third, as well. On this particular end, a version that hews closer to discern realities might work well, also. Still, these take me very far in the drafting process :) my thanks.<br /><br />+Eric L <span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink" href="https://plus.google.com/104811112088336879051" oid="104811112088336879051">Eric Lochstampfor</a></span> ks for your note, also! I have set out the bulk of the facts, but left room for fill ins and player additions. No fact set I could come up with would be as good as the ones my players put together ;)<br /><br />And thanks to all for they&#39;re responses/comments! I really do appreciate it!</p>
