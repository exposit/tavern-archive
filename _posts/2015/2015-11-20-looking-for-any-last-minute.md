        <p>Come check out Greybark Adventurers&#39; League! (Adventures for 18+ only!)<br /><br />There aren&#39;t any sessions scheduled for this weekend just yet, but i suspect one may pop up.<br /><br />We&#39;re exploring a living campaign of Dungeon World with a rotating cast of players and GMs. Game sessions are self-contained episodes so anyone can jump right in, and the GMs use these sessions to develop the world through player feedback. Come play to find out what happens at: <a href="https://plus.google.com/u/0/communities/106322006169543437072" class="ot-anchor">https://plus.google.com/u/0/communities/106322006169543437072</a></p>

        <p>Don&#39;t Miss out; Its now or never. Open your mind to a world unimaginable. Defined and designed. Unleashed and unmatched. Open world and Stream lined. Lots of Home Brew; But almost the entire standard as well.Â <a href="https://app.roll20.net/lfg/listing/25962/the-obsidian-guard-the-titan-lords" class="ot-anchor">https://app.roll20.net/lfg/listing/25962/the-obsidian-guard-the-titan-lords</a></p>
