a couple of quick sketches here . . .<br /><br />A soaring tower that was supposed to house an Order of Paladins but ended up looking more arcane than divine. Not sure when and where I will use it.<br /><br />Some stones and bones. I don&#39;t know why, but I enjoy drawing rocks and boulders. And Calvin &amp; Hobbes-styled trees.<br /><br />Lastly, a regional map for a new area my players are moving into. There is Starkenhold, a nearby ruin, some woods and hills and of course, a whole bunch of blank, empty space to fill in later.<br /><br />

        <p>Disney castle would hold both wizards and paladins, I&#39;d imagine.ï»¿<br /><br />PS: Great work!</p>

        <p>Gonna be honest, I&#39;d buy a PDF on OBS of your drawings.  Just a book of inspirations for DW and other fantasy games.</p>

        <p>These are wonderful. I absolutely love that tower! Do you do commissions?</p>

        <p>For now, Im open to taking requests. I&#39;m hoping to establish a decent portfolio before I start getting into the $ side of things, and even then, since this is just a hobby, I&#39;d probably be thinking more along the lines of gratuity/donations rather than a flat out fee. <br />Cheers.</p>

        <p>You could be professional. I assure you. In fact, I&#39;m working on an adventure for Dungeon World and the moment I saw that castle, I thought of how that would look good in the background of an opening page or in line with text. You have a skill. I look forward to seeing more!</p>
