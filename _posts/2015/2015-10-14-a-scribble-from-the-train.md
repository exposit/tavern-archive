        <p>Amazing. I&#39;m always impressed with work like this. Especially rushed like you say, a simple train ride spawned this awesome piece of work.</p>

        <p>I love the scarf. It makes me think its fleshless bones are chilly. Â Also love the way that you managed to make one eye look like it was bulging crazily, even though it has no eyes.</p>

        <p>Thanks guys! And yeah, I gave him a scarf. I felt bad for him.<br /><br />Somehow I always imagine liches as kind of tragic figures. All this power, but in the end they are just a lonely corpse.</p>
