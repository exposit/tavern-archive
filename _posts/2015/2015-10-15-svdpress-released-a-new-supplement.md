<b>SVDPress</b> released a new supplement and it is seriously cool<br /><br /><a href="https://t.co/I3AzF7s0Fz" class="ot-anchor">https://t.co/I3AzF7s0Fz</a><br /><br />The Fortune Tellers Guide to Deathtrap Dungeon Design is incredibly useful for getting the creative juices going; i both plan ahead or use it for quick improvisation on the fly.Â  Dont worry, you do not actually need to use this just to kill players, it is more to help create some atmospheric, complete rooms/puzzles with great synergy.<br /><br />Full disclosure: I illustrated the Deck of Many Things in the ebook, so if you are interested in a free printable set, just shoot me a hangouts message.
