I am going to run DW at the teen center of my local public library. Since it&#39;s summer, the group will be of manageable size (4-6). When school starts, however, that number might double.<br /><br />Any ideas for strategies of dealing with such a large group? I was considering having new players be hirelings and only create new characters once a month. This will allow players who only want to sit in for a session to participate, but not disrupt the overall campaign.

        <p>Co-GM duties. Use the time spent with a manageable group size to teach volunteers to run the game. Then, when school starts, have those kids familiar with the game either be co-GMs or break off to run their own groups.</p>

        <p>I&#39;m working on a group for Steampunk World that are all on an airship and the group that is available will be the guys that go on the &#39;away&#39; mission.  the others that aren&#39;t there that week will stay on the ship as crew.</p>

        <p>Here is an idea I used with a large group in college a long time ago.....6 players, each &quot;managing&quot; the new players as hirelings! For Example....You could assign Jack(playing a fighter) 2 hirelings (shield carrier and monk). Now the player is responsible for the actions of the hirelings. The hirelings can do their own rolling and declare their actions thru the player that &quot;hired&quot; them. Jack would communicate to the DM what he and his hirelings are doing. Still alot to manage but some of the &quot;work&quot; is handled by the players. This is easier to do in DW since you don&#39;t roll for the monster. There are other XP uses and new teamwork tactics that we created into moves and benefits for everyone to use.....We even had some hirelings get promoted to heroes when the player who &quot;hired&quot; them got removed/retired/KIA or just never came back to play. Everyone loved the change of pace and group dynamics that ensued.</p>

        <p>Thanks for the feedback! We can&#39;t break off into smaller groups, because there is only one play area. Bringing on new PCs as hirelings employed by a full PC is a great idea. I&#39;ll try it and see what happens. Play to discover.</p>

        <p>I teach DW to 5th graders. I just started teaching them to DM, and they were running the game by themselves in no time.</p>
