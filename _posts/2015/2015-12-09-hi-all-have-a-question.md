        <p>Not as written, but talk to your GM. if they think it would provide too much utility over the standard zombie, maybe they will permit it if you devote one of the traits (based on your success rolling animate dead) to a &#39;swarm&#39; ability.</p>

        <p>Or maybe your DM Will let you do it like a wizards ritual sort of thing.<br />Bonus question: Can you take the same trait more than once, for Your zombie?</p>

        <p>I read the first two options as totally stackable.</p>

        <p>Oh word, that sounds more like ritual magic, a compendium class, or even a potential campaign front to me then.</p>

        <p>Certainly creating higher undead isn&#39;t part of the move as written, but I don&#39;t see anything that would prevent you from creating several zombies at a time. You will be limited by the stacking -1 to cast a spell, which will mean you&#39;ll end up getting some failures pretty quickly. And I imagine hard moves can get pretty ugly when you surround yourself with zombies.</p>

        <p>And another wonderful question: Can i reanimate blacksmith that he create me weapons,  or alchemist to make potions and poisons? if we count that there were found hungry spirit of Blacksmith or Alchemist. Or spirit bound to dead body of blacksmith or alchemist? </p>
