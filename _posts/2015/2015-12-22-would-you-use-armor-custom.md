Would you use armor, custom moves, or something else to emulate fancy dodging ability?<br /><br />I have an NPC with kung fu wire fighting style capabilities, but do not know how to emulate this in the crunchy bits. I wish to evoke a bit of the &quot;you whiff&quot; type combat (which I expect in the next session or two).<br /><br />I noticed that the codex has a joke &quot;Captain Murka&quot; with &quot;*Special Qualities:* Any action that specifically targets him cannot be a full success&quot; that could be useful here, but I&#39;m wondering what other people would do.

        <p>Try something like:<br />When defying danger against non-magical damage, +armor.</p>

        <p>Actually, if this is dodging and kung fu style, probably you don&#39;t want to roll with + armor.<br />Maybe the opposite, or maybe roll with DEX minus armor (so you encourage light or no armor for this type of combat).<br />Perhaps a tuned Defy Danger could work, or even the possibility to trigger Defy Danger in lots of situations when other characters would just suffer harm?</p>

        <p>I&#39;d just go with Fiction; the PCs need to maneuver in some way before they can even attempt to inflict damage.  (note: the presence of a  Wizard can really take the wind out of the sails of an opponent like this, so plan accordingly for the fact that he may just get Magic Missle-d into an early grave.)</p>

But you&#39;re right, hack and slash seems to cover this case with the fiction:<br /><br /><i>Note that an “attack” is some action that a player undertakes that has a chance of causing physical harm to someone else. Attacking a dragon with inch-thick metal scales full of magical energy using a typical sword is like swinging a meat cleaver at a tank: it just isn’t going to cause any harm, so hack and slash doesn’t apply.</i><br /><br />Volley doesn&#39;t seem to have a similar restriction, but I could apply the rule with a Special Quality like above - perhaps &quot;As long as she is free to move, she can not be hit by any physical action with a chance of failure&quot; or some such.</p>

        <p>If this evasiveness is core to the Playbook, it should be supported in the moves, rather then left to Defy Danger.<br /><br />When you evade an enemy&#39;s melee attack, roll + DEX.  On a hit, you avoid their blow.   On a 10+ choose one:<br />Deal class damage against them;<br />Take their weapon; or<br />Take their position or balance.<br /><br />When you evade an enemy&#39;s missile, roll + DEX.  On a hit,  you dodge out of the way.   On a 10+, choose one:<br />Redirect the missile into a target of your choosing;<br />Catch/break/block the missile dramatically and dismay  or impress the enemy;<br />Force the enemy to use extra ammo in their effort to hit you; or<br />Lure the enemy into an exposed position to grant you or an ally +1 forward against them.<br /></p>

        <p>For a monster/NPC, I use a combo of armor &amp; moves or qualities.  <br /><br />The armor comes naturally, based on the monster creation guidelines.  They clearly are &quot;skilled in defense&quot; so they get +1 armor.  It might get another +1 armor if it &quot;actively defends itself, with a shield or similar.&quot;<br /><br />Then, if slipperiness/defense/skill at arms is really important to the monster&#39;s concept, I&#39;ll also write a move or quality about it.  For example, one of my big bads (an undead elven warlord) has a move &quot;Counter all but the most inspired attacks.&quot;  <br /><br />That move or quality becomes a &quot;block,&quot; one that prevents characters from triggering H&amp;S or Volley unless they do something to overcome it in the fiction.  And it also becomes a potential hard move.<br /><br />For example, if a character attacks boldly and directly (&quot;Elf-wight, huh?  I run up and chop at her, like ha! Hack and slash?&quot;) then I might take that as a golden opportunity and make a hard move in response (&quot;It&#39;s like attacking the wind. She&#39;s just not there, and you barely register a flash of silver as her blade bites into your sword arm. Take [b]2d12+1 damage, 4 piercing, messy.&quot;)  (This is a big bad, remember.)<br /><br />If a player is more cautious about it, or if they&#39;ve seen her in action before, I&#39;ll <b>tell them the consequences and ask</b>.  &quot;If you just go in there swinging, you just know she&#39;ll see it coming and counter it.  What do you do?&quot;  <br /><br />If they discern realities (and hit), they might get some useful info about how to overcome her guard (&quot;What here is useful to you? Maybe you could drop that war-banner hanging over her crypt. It might give you a moment&#39;s distraction, but only if you do it without giving her an opening.&quot;)<br /><br />If the fighter, master fencer that he is, wants to engage her and try to figure out her guard, I&#39;d <b>tell him the requirements</b>.  &quot;If you engage her, even cautiously, you&#39;ll be defying all sorts of danger. But if you do it, it&#39;ll give you a chance to discern realities about her fighting style. You game?&quot;</p>

        <p>Aaron, I guess it depends how much prep you want to do for the encounter.<br />If you just describe the NPC as you did here, and explain to them (immediately, or when they ask, or when they try to engage...) that Hack &amp; Slash simply does not trigger, you pass the ball to them.<br />They will try to come up with some solution (i.e. someone Defying Danger to tackle and block the opponent) and you should be ready to make a GM call, on the spot, of which move it would trigger (likely Defy Danger) and what would be the cost/retribution for failure.<br />(Make sure you know what to respond if they start to ask questions Discern Realities)<br /><br />If you make some custom moves, then you sort of &#39;lock&#39; them into a given approach. So if you write that they must Defy Danger + DEX only to unlock Hack &amp; Slash, that&#39;s what they will do.<br />(I am sure you will have a better and more colorful idea than Defy Danger + DEX - this is just a stupid example)<br />In other words, if you start to write mechanical custom moves, these are the moves they will do.<br />I am not saying it&#39;s bad: it is mechanically clear and they might be fine with it, but the custom move should be flexible enough to allow a multitude of different approaches, probably, to grant your players some creativity margin.</p>

        <p>Oh, and if you want something crunchier or more reliable, you could write a custom move that requires accumulating hold or progress.<br /><br />Here&#39;s an example off the top of my head:<br /><br />When you engage Tai Lung in battle, roll+STR (or+DEX if you wield a <i>precise</i> weapon). On a 10+, you gain 1 momentum.  On a 7-9, choose 1:<br /> - Tai Lung counters your moves; lose 1 momentum.<br /> - You gain 1 momentum, but have to suffer a blow from Tai Lung to do so. Take [b]2d10 damage.<br />On a miss, you lose all your momentum in addition to whatever the GM says.  If you break off the fight or let up the pressure, you lose all your momentum.<br /><br />When you have 3 momentum, you can trade it all to pick one of the following:<br />- Hack and slash against Tai Lung normally<br />- Give an ally a chance to hack and slash against Tai Lung normally<br />- Maneuver Tai Lung into a position of your choice.</p>

        <p>One thing I like to keep in mind when introducing an NPC or other element like this is to remember that PCs can&#39;t make moves if they don&#39;t meet the requirement.<br /><br />If an NPC like this one, has the ability to knock arrows out of the air with his kung-fu technique, then they PCs can&#39;t actually make volley rolls with their bows against him. You would just dictate the fiction.<br /><br />&quot;OK, you let fly with one arrow after another but he knocks them aside effortlessly and is still advancing, what do you do?&quot;<br /><br />It might take all the PCs working together to gang up on him so he get&#39;s tired/distracted enough that a PC has the chance to make a move, that&#39;s up to you, but I wouldn&#39;t have the PCs making rolls if they honestly can&#39;t succeed at them, liek arrows or fighting one on one.</p>

        <p>Cool!  If you use the momentum move (or something like it), I&#39;d love to hear how it goes.  <br />In my head, it seems pretty sound. But I&#39;m wondering if it will 1) disengage players from the fiction, 2) work well with the other stuff the player&#39;s might try (like Backstab or use an animated rope or whatever), and 3) end up being just bloody lethal for the PCs. </p>

        <p>The &quot;give an ally a chance&quot; part of your move made me consider doing momentum at a group level. Maybe, for instance, you need 5 momentum to get in one solid hit, but all players build a single pool (maybe renamed to evoke the idea that it is HER lack of focus that is building).<br /><br />This FEELS a bit like stacking Advantages in Fate, and I like that. I&#39;m also milling about extending it to &quot;When you engage or distract Shuulan ...&quot; allowing the move to encompass more fictional acts than just attacking - throwing a bucket of water, ripping down a clothes line, torturing her manservant in the corner, etc. It&#39;s entirely possible this could just be covered with <i>Aid</i>, though.<br /><br />As for point 1, I think as long as I/we keep to describing momentum gains and losses fictionally instead of just plus/minus points, it&#39;d be fine.</p>

        <p>Hmm.  Possibly a more elegant solution:  give Shuulan 5 &quot;poise,&quot; and the following custom moves:<br /><br />When Shuulan would take damage or otherwise suffer the effects of an attack, she can spend 1 poise to avoid harm. If she does, describe how she twists, dodges, parries, or otherwise counters the attack.<br /><br />When Shuulan has the opportunity to make an attack, she can choose to deal no damage and instead befuddle, stun, or trip up a foe within her reach. If she does, she regains 1 poise.<br /><br />When Shuulan has more than a few moments to catch her breath and assume a new stance, she regains all her lost poise, up to 4 poise. Each time she uses this move, she regains 1 less poise.<br /><br />(Adjust the amount of poise she starts with and resets to to taste.)</p>
