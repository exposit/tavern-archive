Hey all.<br /><br />This is a custom move I developed to provide for retroactive planning in a Sixth World game. Retroactive planning is very useful to prevent dithering during the planning stages of an operation and also makes the PCs look like badasses.<br /><br />Please take a look and tell me what you think!<br /><br />RUN THE GAME<br />...when making plans retroactively, roll +Craft.<br />On a 10+, your plans are placed as you envision them, and you must invest a sum of Nuyen roughly equal to the cost of the items required for your plans to work. If the items are recoverable, you can regain their worth on your next downtime.<br /><br />On a 7-9, pick one from the below list. On a 6 or less, pick two.<br /><br />- Your setup is somehow flawed. Something will happen, but it won&#39;t go like you thought it would.<br />- Gain a point of Outmatched. You cannot have more points of Outmatched than your Craft+1.<br />- Expend a Mission Point.<br />- Nuyen costs are doubled and the investment is irrecoverable.<br /><br /> <a rel="nofollow" class="ot-hashtag" href="https://plus.google.com/s/%23preparedness/posts">#preparedness</a>     <a rel="nofollow" class="ot-hashtag" href="https://plus.google.com/s/%23nightsblackagents/posts">#nightsblackagents</a>   <br /> <a rel="nofollow" class="ot-hashtag" href="https://plus.google.com/s/%23sixthworld/posts">#sixthworld</a>

        <p>I was thinking something similar, and for the same reason of people sitting around stuck in a planning rut. I was thinking of making them spend Edge, and the roll would just to be to determine how well the trick went off. Mission Points might be an improvement, as it allows the players to still do the planning portion without doing it to death.<br /><br />What is Outmatched? Is that from another move, or something else you have?</p>

        <p>This kind of thing worked really well in Night&#39;s Black Agents, from which I am &quot;adapting&quot; it. We stopped most of our planning altogether at a certain point, relying on our retroactive stat to see us through.<br /><br />I didn&#39;t want to use Edge for a few reasons: 1) I didn&#39;t want to mess with the Edge economy, 2) like being good at fight or good at talky, I wanted being good at planning to be a tied to a specific skill, and 3) I liked the idea of Legwork/Mission Points not just generating details and boosted rolls, but actually/retroactively generating a strategy to cope with the inevitable complications of those details.<br /><br />My early thoughts involved spending Edge along with Mission Points for overly outlandish schemes, but the &quot;Outmatched&quot; pool occurred to me literally as I was typing the Move, and I like it a lot better.<br /><br />I called that pool &quot;Outmatched&quot; because I thought a pool of &quot;reverse points&quot; would be interesting to characterize as a facet of the current dilemma facing the characters. They are essentially wound points for your ability to outmaneuver the situation. At some point, the situation will spiral out of control and your schemes will fail you. Also, I wanted to generate a Move for &quot;retroactive packing&quot;, which would be used when a character needs a piece of equipment that&#39;s not currently on the character&#39;s equipment list. By giving the pool a specific name, I could tie the &quot;retroactive packing&quot; Move to that pool and essentially create a &quot;planning&quot; resource pool for any kind of retroactive action without having to kludge it into the system.<br /><br />One of my favorite things about *W are the Move options. Well done Move options make the fiction come alive, but also mandate interesting repercussions. How do you feel about the ones I&#39;ve presented here?</p>

        <p>Also, I was thinking certain classes could get better access to the Run the Game move, like allowing Mercenaries to use +Combat instead of +Craft, or somehow enhancing the scope of the move.</p>

        <p>No comments on the move? I guess it is perfect in every way :D</p>
