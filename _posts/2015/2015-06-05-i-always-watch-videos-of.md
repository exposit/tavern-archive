I always watch videos of people playing DW&#39;s first session and that&#39;s so cool, but you don&#39;t play a first session every time you play. I wish there were more videos about continuous play, campaign building, character development and bond-solving, that would be something!

        <p>IME, the later sessions are the better ones - the world building is fun, but actually playing with the toys after you&#39;ve created them, coming up with clever ways to hook them together is the most fun for me.</p>
