The Best Friend Forever Non-Player Character System.<br />AKA the BFF NPCs<br />AKA Surviving in a one-on-one RPG<br /><br />I posted this a while ago and said I wanted to make it into a proper rules supplement. I&#39;ve made it now, and although I&#39;m not sure about &quot;proper&quot; I&#39;d like to get everyone&#39;s feedback on it.<br /><br />Let me know if you think it works, if you like what I&#39;m saying, and if there&#39;s anything you think I should change =)<br /><br />Thanks!<br /><a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/4vb0xdecx7vnp8g/BFF%20NPC%20Rules_Edited%20Layout%20V1.pdf?dl=0" class="ot-anchor">https://www.dropbox.com/s/4vb0xdecx7vnp8g/BFF%20NPC%20Rules_Edited%20Layout%20V1.pdf?dl=0</a>

        <p>Yeah, the theory applies to a lot of systems where the GM doesn&#39;t roll dice. In a standard D&amp;D type game you can help your player with NPCs that have whole stat blocks. But it doesn&#39;t really work like that with DW.</p>

        <p>As a thought I think at least from a narrative standpoint it would be interesting in the GM gave each BFF a secret flaw that would reveal itself in time to the player. Say I was making A Rogueish, Thiefish BFF. I may have his flaw as being &#39;On the Run&#39; which would only become clear to the player at the most inconvenient moments :)<br />Â </p>

        <p>ooooh! I like that. I&#39;m totally going to use that. I think the whole system needs an entry about describing the NPC anyway, so that&#39;s a great element to add.</p>
