Version 0.2 of the Spy. Still one move short though. I moved Sleight of Hand to the advanced moves list. Like a Ghost is just <b>the</b> stealth move and I love it.

        <p>I&#39;m not really a fan of &quot;pick as many as Ability Mod&quot; moves, as it makes it impossible to play a member of the class with a poor score in that stat - which I feel is a shame, as it means playing an entertainingly incompetent character is non-viable. <br /><br />You could maybe make it a &quot;pick 2&quot; move instead, and then have an advanced move to allow an additional pick. </p>

        <p>The +1 forward for Network seems a little awkward to determine, some of the questions could have some overlap; does using one invalidate any bonus from the others? <br /><br />&quot;What&#39;s my best way in?&quot;<br />&quot;They don&#39;t seem to be checking the peasant carts&quot;<br />&quot;Ok, what&#39;s the best way to blend in?&quot;<br />&quot;You see an old man trying to pull his cart but having trouble. He&#39;s a stubborn looking old codger, but he definitely needs the help.&quot;<br /><br />Do you get +1 to convince the stubborn old man? To defy the guards gaze? To keep the old man from starting an argument with another peasant?<br /><br />Given the fiction behind the move, what if you just gave 3 prep, ala the Bolster move? Player spends when they feel it&#39;s appropriate.</p>

        <p>Can you further explain &quot;Like a Ghost?&quot; I am not sure what this means. When I want to perform another move, why don&#39;t I just perform that move? What do you mean by a clandestine manner?</p>

        <p>I like like a ghost.<br />It&#39;s worded oddly but it&#39;s supposed to supplement another move.<br />Like if you roll to H and S, the spy can misdirect and do it silently alongside the standard H and S move options.<br /><br />My crit is that like a ghost is pretty powerful, and along with network it makes cloak and dagger superfluous.<br /><br />If it were me, I would just have the two starting moves.</p>

        <p>Yes, it&#39;s a way of declaring that you&#39;re doing something a certain way. To me, it&#39;s a quick way to give a sort of &quot;universal stealth ability&quot;. It lets you take pretty much any action quietly, unseen, or leave no trace.<br /><br />How does it make Cloak and Dagger superfluous though?</p>

        <p>Because it goes against the tone set up by the others.<br /><br />Why snipe when you can get a same or better result when you &quot;volley like a ghost?&quot;<br /><br />Misdirection is also covered by LAG.<br /><br />I think close quarter combat is a little overkill, even the base thief&#39;s backstab is only +n damage. <br /><br />Non lethal is ok, but its better off as a simple s-harm style tag (defined alongside your gear) that applies to a few weapons the spy has access to.<br /><br />Prod (hand, s-harm)<br /><br /><br />But if you absolutely need 3 starting moves, I&#39;d replace Cloak and Dagger with:<br /><b>Close Quarters Combat</b><br />When <b>you attack without weapons</b>, your hands count as a weapon with the hand and s-harm tags.<br /><br /><br />S-harm comes from apocalypse world originally, but can easily be renamed stun or knockout.<br /><br />If a pc is hit with s-harm they must defy danger to attempt anything.<br /><br /></p>

        <p>In fact, I suggest keeping it at 2 moves and have a third come from your background.<br /><br />Keep sleight for the mastermind<br />Make cqc the state agent move<br />And keep the discern bonus for PIs</p>

        <p>For me, it was a good way to get around DW&#39;s lack of stealth rules, other than just fictional positioning/DD. Do you think this sort of thing is necessary?<br /><br />With regards to Close Quarters being powerful, the Thief also has a higher starting base damage, and the Spy has no moves which allow them to deal more.</p>

        <p>I tried swapping out some moves, abandoning Like a Ghost and making Cloak and Dagger more like a traditional Backstab. For this move, I went with ignoring armor instead of bonus damage. I&#39;d like to give this ability somewhere, since IMO it reflects the Spy knowing where to strike. <br /><br />So, the result is something that looks a bit simpler to run, but may feel too much like the Thief now. I&#39;d like to avoid that if at all possible.<br /><br /><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BwbHes6iNuGrVDBteGxiZlNDcWM/view?usp=sharing" class="ot-anchor">https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BwbHes6iNuGrVDBteGxiZlNDcWM/view?usp=sharing</a></p>
