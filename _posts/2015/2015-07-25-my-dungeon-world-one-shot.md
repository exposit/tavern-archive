My dungeon world one shot is happening tomorrow. All are welcome, especially newbies. 11 AM to 2 PM Pacific standard time. Comment if you&#39;re interested and I will invite you. There are limitations on group size, but so far we don&#39;t have a full group! <br /><br />The campaign involves a town where the townsfolk are disappearing. The group will have to investigate why these disappearances are happening.<br /><br />Anyone joining may be added to future campaigns that  may stretch a longer breadth, if they are interested.<br /><br />This is on <a href="http://roll20.net" class="ot-anchor">roll20.net</a> with google hangouts for voice and audio.

        <p>What playbooks are already taken? I assume one-shot means we&#39;re not doing chargen online</p>

        <p>Thus far, no classes have been chosen. I&#39;m not familiar with chargen online.</p>

        <p>What I meant is that usually in *W games it is good to do character generation with the group during first session etc, but it usually takes whole first session. Since this is oneshot, it&#39;d be logical to do it mostly &#39;offline&#39; before start</p>

        <p>If you have a class preference, first to speak owns that class. I&#39;m not opposed to having multiple PCs playing the same class, but if I see a trend of 6 wizards I&#39;ll speak up. ;)</p>

        <p>Righto. I&#39;ve generated 6+ characters already, each one made in such a way that I would prefer if I were playing that PC... That being said, if you want to work offline and create a character, or modify an existing character, that&#39;s A-okay with me. I have one player who asked for access to the campaign so they could put their character in <a href="http://roll20.net" class="ot-anchor">roll20.net</a> right now. What would you like to do?<br /><br /><br />Aside, I&#39;m all for a session 0, where characters and goals are discussed, but I&#39;m just trying to get a one shot off the ground. :)</p>

        <p>It&#39;s not a perfect situation, but that&#39;s why I&#39;m hiding behind the One Shot tag. <br /><br />I vastly prefer log running games, but I have lost a lot of players due to schedule change and am essentially drafting here for my next campaign.</p>

        <p>I know how this happens, man. That said, I&#39;d look at cleric sheet. <br />Just to mention, my only communication tool right now is Ipad, I hope it will be enough.</p>

        <p>I&#39;ve looked into this as I&#39;ve done a few games via bus. The roll20 app for iPad is great for rolls. Google Chrome for the maps, (though there may be none at all) and the Google Hangouts app for video/audio.</p>

        <p>does switch between apps (e.g. from hangouts to roll20) break your video/audio connection?<br /></p>

        <p>I prefer to use Hangouts, as it&#39;s better at that function than the built in video chat, and I occasionally make it a live hangout or record it.</p>

        <p>Nope. If you&#39;re running something newer than an iPad 2 or so, it&#39;ll continue the audio connection.</p>

        <p>I think I&#39;d be game to attend. I&#39;m happy to play thief, fighter, or ranger.<br /><br />Also, I have a cool Google Doc I used last week which has all the basic level one classes already, and makes it easy to have all the characters together. The only thing it&#39;s missing are the bonds. If you like, I&#39;d be happy to share it with you.</p>

        <p>Me and a friend of mine are looking for a new DW hangout group, and that time works for us if there&#39;s still room.  We&#39;re down for whatever, just looking to meet fun people.</p>
