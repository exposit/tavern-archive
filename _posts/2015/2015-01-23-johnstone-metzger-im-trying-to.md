        <p>I need to look if i have the class - could pull it it apart into different specialties if you want. </p>

        <p>I&#39;d say Acrobat and Duelist... and then, maybe something social? Hm.</p>

        <p>I have sort-of similar moves in Acrobat and Duellist, as well as Bard and Wayfarer. If I were gonna take the Dashing Hero&#39;s moves and make specialties... lemme see... maybe this:<br /><br /><b>Famous Hero,</b> who starts with A Lover in Every Port and has advanced moves like Famous, Old Enemies, A Knight in Shining Armour Appears, and Loyal Fans.<br /><br /><b>Duelling Hero,</b> who starts with Parry and True Love and High Adventure, and has advanced moves like Draw Your Blade, In the Nick of Time, Now I Have the Upper Hand, Master Swordsman, and Thrill of Danger.<br /><br /><b>Swashbuckling Hero,</b> Who starts with Daring Devil and Plan of Action. Except my swashbuckling move happens automatically and you don&#39;t need to roll for it. But the Dashing Hero gets True Love and High Adventure, so it makes sense to roll for it, so you can get more out of the starting moves.<br /><br />Anyway, this playbook&#39;s a lot more cohesive than most and resists being broken down into specialties. What sort of tweaks did you have in mind?</p>

Which, as you know well and I have told you before, is what CW does best. :)</p>

        <p>Cool. It&#39;s a pretty good playbook.</p>
