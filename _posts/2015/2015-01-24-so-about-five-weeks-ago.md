So about five weeks ago, I found a group of guys on /r/lfg to run Dungeon World for.<br /><br />I&#39;m in Australia, and they&#39;re in the US, so for me, when we play, it&#39;s Saturday around midday, and for them, it&#39;s Friday evening. Its worked out really well so far, playing for about four hours each session.<br /><br />In three sessions, they&#39;ve finished off the intro &quot;adventure&quot; I cooked up. I plonked them down with some combats, right near a refuge to the god Bo-Voormith, the king of dreams.<br /><br />Just a half hour ago, we finished up with that, and next session they&#39;ll be on the road to the nearest town, where they were heading before they got sort of swept up into the fray.<br /><br />It&#39;s been a really great learning experience, and I just wanted to share with you guys how much I love Dungeon World. Thanks for existing, and thank you all for sharing stories.
