10 hours left in the Kickstarter! Everybody who backs at $10 or more is getting three full books in PDF form, and all three are also available as softcovers. If you get them all, you get a reduced rate. AND we&#39;ll be making a custom character sheet for each Chaos World. Thank you to all our backers!

        <p>Will there be a Backerkit like there was for Urban Shadows? So you can up your pledge after the KS if your budget opens up, for example?</p>
