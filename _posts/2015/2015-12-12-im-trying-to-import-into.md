I&#39;m trying to import Into the Odd&#39;s idea of harmful and strange Arcana into my world. I was thinking something like:<br /><br />When you <b>use an arcana</b>, roll-Power. On a 7-9 choose one; on 6- both.<br />    - The result is strange and warped, GM decides how<br />    - You take d6 damage<br /><br />Where an Arcana has a power level between 1-5 that emulates a single spell from other RPGs.<br /><br />Ideas? Thoughts?
