In one of my campaigns, I have a player who is playing the Artificer class. One of her gadgets that she has used since the beginning was a Electrical Amplification Glove. She has recently met and become the follower of an Aspect of Power and Artifacts in the local pantheon. This Aspect has upgraded her gadget to artifact status. Since she is leveling up soon, I was wanting to find some good moves that would fit into an &quot;Artifact Bearer&quot; compendium class. Moves that focus either on lighting / weather or gauntlet / armor style moves.

        <p>As a basic move you could make something like: &quot;The Artifact you have with you is indestructible and you always know in which direction you can find it.&quot;<br /><br />others could include something similar to the signature Weapon of the fighter, that it gets additional effects or that you could commune with the Weapon to get answeres.<br />Or you could simply increase his damage dice when he uses this Glove to attack. There are a lot of possibilitys. <br /></p>

        <p>Thanks for the advice. I wonder if there is a compendium class that is already close enough that I could steal some moves from.</p>
