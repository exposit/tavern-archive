Had an AWESOME first session this past weekend. Really love this system. I had a VERY creative Druid, for whom I already need to create a couple custom moves. I&#39;d love some feedback if you have the time!<br /><br />The party ran foul of Bakunawa (monster on pg. 245), and through some clever planning managed to get Bakunawa to ingest Goldenroot poison. Long story short: Druid was able to study Bakunawa and gained the ability to shapeshift into her. I allowed him to use Bakunawa&#39;s ability to &quot;lure with lies and illusions&quot; and it was in severe danger of being OP. In hindsight, I could have said the ability was magic and thus he was unable to mimic it, but I said it was pheremones and thus it makes sense in the game fiction. So I made THIS move:<br /><br />BAKUNAWA’S PHEREMONES<br /><br />When you have shapeshifted into the form of Bakunawa and spend one hold to emit your pheromones, roll + CHA.<br />* On a 10+, targets clustered together see visions of their greatest desire. * On a 7-9 you do not control the vision your targets see.<br /><br />The other move has to do with mushrooms the druid harvested from his homeland. After I questioned him as to their effects, he said that they grant a bonus to healing magic (he has a bond with the party&#39;s cleric). I told him I would create a custom move to ensure that it&#39;s not too OP. Let me know what you think!<br /><br />ARCANE MUSHROOMS (three uses)<br /><br />When you ingest the mushrooms Puck gathered from the far reaches of the desert, roll + WIS and brace yourself.<br />* On a 10+ choose two. * On a 7-9 choose one. <br />•	You channel the energy of the Ancients when casting magic that mends, but doesn’t destroy. Roll the power of your spell twice and take the higher roll.<br />•	You don’t fall down a rabbit hole of psychosis-induced paranoia.<br />•	The Ancients grant you a moment of transcendent clarity, ask the GM any question.

        <p>Excellent moves!  I am inspired.<br /><br />Only concerns on the mushroom move -<br /><br />1) Is it necessary that Puck gathered them, or could they find another source to these mushrooms?  Perhaps later down the road they meet Marco Polo, and he has a supply?  If so, the move might better name the mushroom, instead of require Puck gathered them.<br /><br />2) the system already refers to the mechanic of choosing best of two rolls.  May want to rephrase the action portion of the first option: &quot;Your spell has the best effect of two rolls.&quot;<br /><br />I love the option for psychosis and/or transcendence - this move specifically pushes the narrative.  I&#39;m intrigued by the 7-9 person who chooses option 3 - do they have a transcendent psychotic break, with no healing benefit?  This could be fantastic to watch, particularly in the middle of a stressful scene where healing was likely important.</p>

        <p>Pheromones move <br /><br />On a 10+ do they see THEIR greatest desire or one of your choosing? If it is the former then the 7-9 makes no sense.</p>

That is super confusing and actually makes the 7-9 equal to the 10+. </p>

        <p><span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink" href="https://plus.google.com/110330901807759406775" oid="110330901807759406775">Tim Franzke</a></span>  The move doesn&#39;t specify that on a 10 + you <b>don&#39;t</b> control the visions - it leaves it ambiguous.  The GM may well turn it around on the player &quot;What is this target&#39;s greatest desire?&quot; and work with that answer; but the GM isn&#39;t required to do so - they just need to make it effective.<br /><br />If you change the move to state that on a 10+ the Druid explicitly controls the visions, then that runs the risk of giving a player too much control over giving that particular target motivations that conflict with some other relevant fiction, or giving a bad GM the leeway of saying &quot;So that&#39;s what they see? It&#39;s not interested in what you&#39;re showing them.&quot;<br /><br />The move may benefit from refinement, but i don&#39;t agree that it is wrong as written.  I really, really like it as currently written.  Its current phrasing provokes lots of ideas about how this could be turned around to make the Druids&#39; move mostly successful on a 7-9, but still have interesting drawbacks. It leaves itself open to interpretation in the spur of the moment, as a good move should.</p>

This is very helpful as it&#39;s my first time creating any custom moves.<br /><br />Regarding the Pheromones:<br />I think you both make excellent points. Most of the confusion does lie in my poor wording of the 7-9 result, which I had intended to leave semi-ambiguous. When I wrote &quot;you do not control the vision,&quot; I wanted to give a sense that the pheromones work, but the illusions are not necessarily what the target DESIRES. Maybe the target sees what they fear most, and it sends them into a shrieking run, alerting others nearby. I wanted to give a little leeway for the interpretation for some danger/hurdles to be thrown the PC&#39;s way.<br /><br />I think I do need to rephrase it, as I do not want the PCs to have control over the 10+ result. The vision itself is in the heads of the targets, as it taps into their personal desires, so having a PC decide what a target&#39;s desire is doesn&#39;t make a whole lot of sense.</p>

Good catch. Whoever gathers them could definitely use them in the same way.<br /><br />2) THANK YOU. I was trying so hard to word this properly and you just saved me a massive headache. To clarify with an example: It is clear then that if the Cleric ingests the mushrooms and chooses the healing option, he will roll + WIS to cast the spell...and THEN he will roll 2d8 and choose the best of those two rolls for the amount of damage healed (meaning if he rolled a 3 and a 7, he would pick the 7).</p>

        <p>My two cents: very good moves. My tweaks and thoughts are below. Good luck! Making stuff for dungoen world is trickier than it first appears.<br /><br />BAKUNAWA’S PHEREMONES<br /><br />When you have shapeshifted into the form of Bakunawa and spend one hold to emit your pheromones, roll + CHA.<br />* On a 10+, everyone in the general area sees a vision with a theme of your choice.<br />* On a 7-9 everyone in the general area sees a vision with a theme of the GM&#39;s choice.<br />Themes: Fear, Love, Greed, Delight, Confusion, Danger, Safety, Elves, Dwarves, Trolls, etc<br /><br />ARCANE MUSHROOMS (three uses)<br />(Tweaks: what they said ;) haha)<br /><br /><br />And a  badly made bonus move for if you decide you do want to make it a Puck-specific(I love the name and the reference :P) ability.<br /><br />When Puck goes to gather and prepare arcane mushrooms from the far reaches of the desert, or any other place they would be available in abundance, roll+WIS.<br />On a 10+, the mushrooms are of a superior variety. Take +1 to rolling when used. On a 7-9,  the mushrooms are of a inferior variety. Take -1 to rolling when used.<br />On a miss here, Puck is interrupted in his task, the mushrooms poison the party, the mushrooms come alive and eat him, he finds no mushrooms and takes 1d4 damage.<br /><br />Also: I would think it would be &#39;far reaches of the forest&#39;. Unless they&#39;re super duper special shrooms that grow in the desert. Good luck man.<br /><br /><span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink" href="https://plus.google.com/114448452930521105065" oid="114448452930521105065">Joe Bryant</a></span>  </p>

I guess I just have to decide whether I want the players to have leeway with deciding the nature of the illusions. As I look back at the first draft, the 7-9 result may have been worded in a way that sounds too negative, when a 7-9 should still be a success in some way.<br /><br />Mushroom gathering: Really like this! If they find themselves in a situation to get more, totally using this.</p>
