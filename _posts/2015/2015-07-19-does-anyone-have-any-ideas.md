Does anyone have any ideas for using moves that support teamwork? Here is an example I read somewhere....The next time you use a move that includes the support of any of your party, you may Hold 1. Or maybe Hold 1 for every party member working together.<br /><br />I would add this as a basic move, but I am sure there are other ways to use them. Like, adding +3 instead of the normal +2 bonus for teamwork actions.<br /><br />I am working on a Sixth World Campaign and I thought this would help build teamwork moves for the group to use.<br /><br />Anyone have any other ideas for teamwork moves in Sixth World or Dungeon World?

        <p>The moves already do this. Remember that they are imbedded in the fiction. To do it do it, yeah? So if someone says they want to <b>Defend</b> they need to <i>stand in defence of someone</i> in the fiction, which implies teamwork already. <br />Likewise when you <b>Assist</b> someone, you risk putting yourself in danger to give them a bonus (multiple characters can perform this so long as it works in the fiction).<br /><br />You can always make a custom move as you suggest, something along the lines of all in to achieve an effect greater than a sole effort but then risking detriment to the whole party.</p>

        <p>Use the GM moves:<br />1. Soft moves are great for setting up co-op play.  <br />e.g. You notice a Goblin about to backstab the Wizard. What do you do?<br /><br />2. Fails can be applied against characters other than the one who made the roll, forcing the party to act in response to each other&#39;s actions.<br />e.g. The Gryphon leaps over your swing, snatches the Bard up in its claws and takes off over the lake.<br /><br />3. Moving the spotlight between the characters generates opportunities for co-op play.<br />e.g. The Goblins charge towards the Fighter. Thief, what do you do?</p>

        <p>The basic Aid move already gives a +1 for success, and is kind of lame and in my experience rarely used.  Presumably you want to encourage something fancier than that.  If you want to add something, I&#39;d strongly recommend something other than more +1s, both because it&#39;s way better to have something story-focused, and because extra +1s risk breaking the system.  (You never <b>ever</b> want anyone to be rolling at +5, because then they literally cannot fail.)<br /><br />Granting hold of some kind (&#39;teamwork&#39; might be as good a name for it as any) after characters do the kind of move you want to encourage seems like a good way to go.  To make it work, you need to describe the teamwork move, so that it can trigger, and then you need to define what you can spend teamwork on.</p>
