So my players are going to be travelling towards a city or town with a wizard&#39;s tower in the middle.<br /><br />I&#39;m wanting some sort of magical experiment to go wrong. So far I&#39;m thinking a golem with magnetic abilities ( its meant to be a tax collector... But it didnt quite work).<br /><br />Does anyone have any other cool ideas or ways to make that idea awesome?<br /><br />

        <p>Hey, the last session of my game started with the players traveling to a town with a wizard&#39;s tower :D The town/tower were captured by a band of orcs.<br /><br />It wasn&#39;t necessarily an &quot;experiment gone wrong&quot;, but one of the things the players all seemed to like was there was one floor of the tower that was 100% silent. No noise or sound whatsoever. The reason for it was that&#39;s where they were keeping all of the students and children, and this way they couldn&#39;t cast magic and also the person who had captured the Â tower wouldn&#39;t have to listen to the children crying.<br /><br />It sounds simple, but it was a lot of fun to play with. The players had to communicate non-verbally (I wouldn&#39;t let them talk aloud), and it made for a fun and unique challenge.</p>

        <p>A silient city does sound pretty cool. I&#39;m very new to gming though and I&#39;m not sure I could handle something like that properly</p>

        <p>Oh I was just thinking one small section perhaps :) Could be there&#39;s some wild magic stuff going on, with little pockets of magic spurting here &#39;n there.</p>

        <p>Hmm. any idea what would cause pockets of wild magic?<br /><br />Maybe some experiment into the effects of concentrated magic but an apprentice messed up the bindings designed to localise the effect?</p>

        <p>Possibly!<br /><br />Or perhaps the wizards were trying to tap into other dimensions in order to draw more power, but they unwittingly opened small but problematic portals to other planes. This could cause completely random effects to sprout.</p>

        <p>That sounds epic and I might use it for the basis of a future game (or one with a wizard in my party :D) <br /><br />This is just a bit of action for them when they are in the city :D</p>

        <p>I got it. An airship filed by magic. One of the &quot;engines&quot; explodes and releases the elemental bound to it. <br /><br />Also this let&#39;s me introduce airship tech later on:D</p>

        <p>Also don&#39;t forget if you can&#39;t come up with something ask one of the players a question about the magic and what happened. Most of the time they will come up with something cool.</p>

        <p>None of them actually have any non divine magic :( They have encountered a friendly mage who owes them a favour. I was gonna have him tag along</p>

        <p>Doesn&#39;t matter really if its a magical experment gone wrong then surely rumours would of got out in the world. Players don&#39;t need to be wizards to ask those questions</p>
