        <p>Help me out here...I don&#39;t just want generic combat stuff.  <br /><br />Black robes:<br /><br /><b>Bad boy</b>: the allure of a black robe mage is often irresistible to potential romantic partners, especially if that person is an enemy or an opposed alignment. <br /><br />10+ hold three?<br /><br />7-9 hold one and choose from one option below<br /><br />* ????<br /><br />Or <br /><br />10+ target will perform a surreptitious boon or help the character in some way. Plus one forward to parlay with them in the future. <br /><br />7-9 same as above, but at some point in the future target will become extremely jealous or violent. ???﻿<br />-----<br /><b>Sorcerers Apprentice</b>: you have hitched your star to an erratic and powerful archmage, when you need ritual items that involve dead bodies, hideous and squamous things:<br /><br />10+ your master has it readily on hand. <br /><br />7-9 as above, but he needs you to do something first or it&#39;s down in the basement which he locked for very good reasons...<br />----<br /><b>I see the bad moon arising</b>: when you study for spells attune yourself to Nuitari<br /><br />10+ Äi, it is ascendant. Take plus 1 on all spell casting rolls today and memorize 1 more spell level. <br /><br />7-9 Nuitari commands obedience. Same as above, but all spells must deal with death or violence. ﻿<br />---<br /><br /><b>deal with the devil</b>: you&#39;ve made an agreement with the spirit of a long dead sorcerer for power unimaginable.<br /><br />10+ ???<br /><br />7-9 ???<br />---<br /><br />Not super happy with these. But I like the direction. </p>

        <p>I don&#39;t know the source material to be honest, but I&#39;ll come up with some rubbish to fuel your imagination!<br /><br />Wizards of an Order may take this move:<br />Robes are Cool<br />When you don the robes of your chosen Order, you may use your fearsome reputation as leverage to parley with other users of magic.<br /><br />Black Robe Wizards may take this move:<br />Dark Allure:<br />When you use your wit and charm to worm out of trouble, roll+CHA.<br />On a 10+, you&#39;re free to go, choose 1.<br />On a 7-9, your crime is recognised, but still choose 1.<br />- A good person is impressed by you.<br />- You make an loyal ally of a foolish person.<br />- You did one extra thing they don&#39;t know about yet, describe it.<br /><br />Red Robe Wizards may take this move:<br />When you spend a moonlit night researching magical energies, roll+INT.<br />On a 10+, hold 3.<br />On a 7-9, hold 1.<br />Spend your hold at any time to anticipate a magical opponent and dodge or dissipate a spell targeting you.<br /><br />White Robe Wizards may take this move:<br />When you fight evil under the light of the moon, and recall your oath, roll+CON.<br />On a 10+, choose 3.<br />On a 7-9, choose 1.<br />- Your allies gain +1 armour against magic.<br />- One of your allies takes 1d4 damage forward.<br />- One of your allies will avoid physical debility and mental strain in the next battle.</p>
