Coming from a pathfinder background before dungeon world, I have made mistakes before when it comes to +1s and +2s in the past. So I&#39;d like to post a question to you guys. Where is a +1 or +2 ongoing appropriate and acceptable? +2 ongoing should mostly likely be a taboo, as you can&#39;t fail on a +5. Have you ever used ongoing before? What is it useful for? Regale me with your tales please :P

        <p>In my mind, it would be used in situations where some sort of magical or strategic advantage helps you. Something like this:<br />&quot;Take +1 ongoing while defending the front gate of the magical castle, until it falls.&quot;</p>

        <p>Be specific about what the ongoing bonus applies to and when it expires and you&#39;ll be fine.</p>

        <p>In my playbooks, I think I may have used ongoing once or twice, but it was &quot;+1 ongoing to a specific attribute until X,&quot; where X is an event, such as the end of a battle, once a marked target is dead, until you roll less than a 10+, etc.</p>

        <p>I&#39;ve never used +x in any of the games I&#39;ve run.</p>

        <p>I really prefer bonuses to be highly situational, and stop at +1. Beyond that, you may as well give a hold to its effect and let them take a free auto-success.</p>

        <p>A +1 ongoing is a pretty big deal, and I&#39;d always make it very circumstantial, limited, and/or easy to lose. And always tied to the fiction.  <br /><br />Make is something that they must fight for or consider in their narration if they want to keep it.  Something that pushes them towards acting a particular way or making tough decisions.<br /><br />Example:  *Parkour* When you use your sweet moves and haul ass, take +1 ongoing as long you maintain your momentum.<br /><br />Other good examples are getting +1 ongoing only against a certain foe that has wronged/bested you (there are a few like that in Class Warfare), and the barbarian move that gives you +1 ongoing while your HP are &lt; CON.</p>

        <p>+1 ongoing for one scene, like defending the magical portal <span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink" href="https://plus.google.com/114186342843586498680" oid="114186342843586498680">Harrison s</a></span> suggests, is not the end of the world.  But, the usual advice is that it&#39;s more interesting to give out some more specific advantage:  maybe there&#39;s a magical field that blocks enemy arrows, or a field that boosts your armor, or an ongoing magical heal, or a magical drawbridge that&#39;s hard to cross.  Two reasons:  one is that it adds more vivid detail to the world; the other is subtle, but important:  the 10+ full success result is boring.  Fun stuff happens on the partials and failures.  Why would you want to increase the chance of the combat being predictable?</p>
