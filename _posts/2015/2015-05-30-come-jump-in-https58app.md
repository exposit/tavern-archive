        <p>I love the idea of player antagonsists (pvp). I would love to hear from people who have done that, and what their experience was like.</p>

        <p>Its vary fun adds alot of spice to the game, this will be my 3rd campaign I will launch next week for Roll20.net and so far its awesome effective and easy. Just grab a friend or post for villains and when they join give them men and buff them up alil to handle more then one actual live player and let the fun begin. So much better then Solo GM role playing every Villain and Monster and God and Primordial Etc Etc. Give it a shot. </p>
