Anyone want to run a solo campaign for me? Seems like it could work pretty well for DW. I don&#39;t have anything set in stone really and am rolling ideas around. I prefer play by post but I&#39;m open to whatever really. Hangouts or <a href="http://roll20.net" class="ot-anchor">roll20.net</a> or Skype is fine by me. I normally play rogues and rangers but kind of wanting to play a wizard or spell caster of some sort. Maybe something wild and daring for a wizard entering a tomb or some catacombs somewhere in search for a powerful and lost spell book or something along those lines. Just some thoughts. Who knows where it may go..

        <p>Right on man. It&#39;s all good and good to see you on here. Our brief DW game a couple years back was much fun. No hurry at all. I have other games going that I&#39;m playing in too..</p>

That fits my erratic schedule better than a hangout/remote game...</p>

        <p>Yea I do prefer PBP myself. Let me roll some things around first before we start. I had quite a few feelers out and have landed in a couple of D&amp;D 4e games now so I&#39;m swamped at the moment..for now anyways. I sure appreciate you man for wanting to do this</p>

        <p>No worries if you&#39;ve got too much going. I <b>wish</b> I could find a 4e game to join!</p>

        <p>That would be great, as I usually have someone sleeping a few feet away from me by that time of night.</p>
