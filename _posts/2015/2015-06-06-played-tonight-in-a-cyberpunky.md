Played tonight in a cyberpunky DW. I played a Science Exploration Bot/Engine of Destruction and the other player played a Human Thief/Industrial Spy. Went crazy well for using a fantasy system for this kinda thing. <span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink" href="https://plus.google.com/116047019277221335862" oid="116047019277221335862">Joshua Ramsey</a></span>â€‹ did an awesome job running it and keeping it going.

        <p>Thanks for the words man. I felt like it faltered at a few spots because I wasn&#39;t sure what to do but I&#39;m glad you enjoyed it.</p>

        <p>Wouldn&#39;t Apocalypse World be more easily adapted to cyberpunk than DW?</p>

        <p>This was an Adventures on Dungeon Planet game that turned out to not have any fantasy elements in it per se. The cyberpunk element kind of arose out of the choices the players made in developing their characters and the way I responded to them.</p>
