Hello all!<br /><br />I&#39;ve run DW a couple of times with a pre-made starter but now I&#39;m getting ready to run it for my usual group this Friday. I&#39;m trying to set up a one-shot set in the familiar campaign setting to see if they like DW and want to switch to it. This seemed like a good time to try out the Fronts, so I&#39;ve created an adventure front for the session. I&#39;d really appreciate any input you can give me on it.<br /><br />Thank you!

        <p>So, this is just a thought... but you may want to come off the pre-made front, particularly if you are trying to convert a group.  Now, obviously, your mileage may vary here, but my experience has shown me the best way to convert a group has been by giving them a chance to really see the system shine -- and it shines the most when you can involve them in the &quot;worldbuilding&quot; a bit.   That said, there&#39;s no &quot;wrong way&quot; to play.  If this works for you and your group, go for it with gusto!</p>

        <p>Thanks for the input Brennan! I ran a one-shot yesterday using the Research move based on John Wick&#39;s dirty dungeon YouTube video and it certainly got people going, I plan to use it in the ongoing campaign if my players adopt the system. What I was hoping for for this post was some direct feedback on the front design itself, as it&#39;s my first time making one.</p>
