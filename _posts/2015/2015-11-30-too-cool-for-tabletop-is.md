Too Cool For Tabletop is now weekly, so here&#39;s Chapter 2 of the Dungeon World mini-campaign we started in Episode #007. More bear facts, more useless cleric, and perhaps even the soiling of shorts.<br /><br /><a href="https://soundcloud.com/tcftpodcast/episode-008-bear-feathers" class="ot-anchor">https://soundcloud.com/tcftpodcast/episode-008-bear-feathers</a><br /><br />Welcome to the podcast where I force disinterested friends &amp; family to play tabletop roleplaying games in order to prove that no one is, in fact, Too Cool For Tabletop. Available on iTunes, SoundCloud, Stitcher, and more!<br /><br /><a href="http://www.toocoolfortabletop.com" class="ot-anchor">www.toocoolfortabletop.com</a>

        <p>I love these. I download them and listen while playing with my one year old girl in her room. Funny and interesting to listen to.  And it&#39;s only gotten better!<br /><br />I strongly recommend giving these guys a chance. Either while your cooking dinner for your family, taking a shower or working on the computer, it&#39;s always better listening to some funny dudes/gals trying (and succeeding) to play RPGs.</p>

        <p>I am finishing up the 1st episode, and I&#39;m really impressed with how much content you get through in just over an hour! Is everything on the show dungeon world, or no?Â </p>

Starting in 2016 we&#39;ll be running a D&amp;D campaign, however. Thanks for listening! I truly appreciate it.</p>
