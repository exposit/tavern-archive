<i>Dungeon World</i> peeps, which invisibility move do you prefer (keeping in mind that they would be available at 1st-level). If you don&#39;t like them, or don&#39;t like everything about them, lemme know why/how&#39;d you tweak them.<br /><br /><b>VERSION 1</b><br />When you <b>turn invisible to the naked eye</b>, roll+CHA. ✴On a 7+, you can walk about without revealing your presence, and take -1 ongoing until you end the effect. ✴On a 7-9, choose 1:<br />* You are only invisible when you are not moving.<br />* You take -1 ongoing to use invisibility until you make camp.<br />(Open to additional list items.)<br /><br />If you attack someone, the effect immediately ends. Note that you can still be heard and smelled, and anything you touch or pick up does not become invisible.<br /><br /><b>VERSION 2</b><br />When you <b>turn invisible to the naked eye</b>, roll+CHA. ✴On a 10+, hold 3 veil. ✴On a 7-9, hold 2 veil. ✴On a miss, hold 1 veil in addition to whatever else the GM says. Spend veil, 1 for 1, to do one of the following:<br />* Move to a nearby area undetected.<br />* Create a distraction, giving you or an ally +1 forward.<br />* Take something without anyone else noticing.<br />(Also open to additional list items.)<br /><br />If you <b>make an attack</b>, losing all remaining veil and take the 10+ result.<br /><br /> <a rel="nofollow" class="ot-hashtag" href="https://plus.google.com/s/%23dungeonworld/posts">#dungeonworld</a>

        <p>Veil looks much more fun. Wanna add &quot;* Be in the right place at the right time&quot;?</p>

        <p>Version 2 wins, at least in my book.</p>

        <p>so in Version ONE your clothes and gear don&#39;t go invisible correct? Will additional moves allow you to become more invisible to other senses? so there is a 2-5 that lets you choose another 1 or 2 that you are invisible and a 6-10 that lets you become invisible to all but the most powerful magics... ie god level perception.<br /><br />On Version TWO you should clarify that when you make an attack, you lose all remaining veil and take the 10+ result for the attack...<br /><br />at first I thought you were redirecting me back up to taking three veil.<br /><br />also dose the part about things not going invisible if you pick them up apply to Version TWO as well?<br /><br />may need clarification on how these work if you walk across a dirty floor/that kind of thing also.<br /><br />Over all I think I like TWO better.<br /><br />some other thoughts.... when you attack someone and they are unaware you deal your damage without rolling Hack and Slash/to Attack automatically. so both versions would be similar in that, but it seems like you are making Version TWO better as you are giving the 10+<br /><br />Over all both work, I like TWO better as it is on a timer essentially. Let&#39;s talk about it a little tonight.</p>

        <p>Version 2 sounds a lot more like calling on a supernatural stealth ability rather than just turning invisible.</p>
