Will there be a Dungeon World presence at PAX East this year? The indie RPG panel last year was my introduction to the system, and I was hoping there&#39;d be more interesting things going on this year too.

        <p>Related question, is anyone willing and able to fly me out to Pax East so that I can run DW the whole time?</p>

        <p>Well, Adam and Sage are part of the crew running the &quot;Playing Between the Lines&quot; event (<a href="http://east.paxsite.com/schedule/panel/playing-between-the-lines" class="ot-anchor">http://east.paxsite.com/schedule/panel/playing-between-the-lines</a>) so there will be something!Â  I expect Dungeon World will be at Games on Demand again as well.</p>
