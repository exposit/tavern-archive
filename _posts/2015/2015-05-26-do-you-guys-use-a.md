        <p>My hack <i>Fourth World</i>, being based on <i>Earthdawn</i>, wherein making things is proof that you haven&#39;t been possessed, contains some minor rules for making stuff.</p>

You can have it.<br /><br />Crafting Magic Items<br />When you engineer a design for a magical item (weapon, armor, artifact, etc) tell the GM what you aim to accomplish. The GM will tell you three or four of the following;<br /><br />You’ll need to disenchant <i>________</i> first.<br />You’ll need the aid of <i>__________</i>.<br />You’ll need to find some <i>__________</i> to use.<br />It’ll take an especially long time to prepare.<br />It’ll be unusually dangerous to craft.<br />You’ll need to craft it someplace special.<br /><br />When you imbue a crafted item with power spend XP and roll+XP spent. On a 10+ choose two tags to imbue the item with. On a 7-9 choose one and the GM will choose one, too. <br /><br />New Tags<br />- glamoured (with a thought from the wielder, this item can take on the form of something else)<br />- indestructable (the item cannot be destroyed by mortal means)<br />- shadow (the item gives off clouds of smoky darkness)<br />- energy aura (the item is tangible to ghosts, spirits, etc)<br />- holy (the item is imbued with divine power, either generally or specifically)<br />- unholy (the item is imbued with energies antithetical to the gods and their works)<br />- bane (the item is particularly hateful to creatures of a particular race or creed)<br />- defender (the item grants +1 armor)<br />- fiery (the item burns with a powerful fire that does not harm the wielder) <br />- icy (the object is fridged and freezing with a cold that does not harm the wielder)<br />- lightning (the object is possessed of a powerful electric charge that does not harm the wielder)<br />- hurled (the item gains +thrown, no matter the form it takes)<br />- thunderous (when struck, the item emits a blast of sound that does not harm the wielder)<br />- chaos-born (the item has an unstable form and can destabilize matter around it)<br />- lawful (the item is imbued with lawful energy, and gives form to the unformed)<br />- wounding (wounds inflicted by the item or in its presence cannot be healed by natural means)<br />- light (the item emits a brilliant light)&quot;<br /><br /><br /></p>

        <p>I dunno about a homebrew craft system, but just lemme say as a smith myself; That guy is very lucky to have two assistants that are proficient with 10lb sledges :P</p>
