Raise your hand if you&#39;ve had a Fighter try to use Bend Bars, Lift Gates on the equivalent of a house-sized metal anvil.

        <p>I played a Fighter a year ago that used BB,LG to shatter a house-sized boulder rolling down a tunnel at the party Indiana Jones-style; does that count?<br /><br />More recently, the Fighter in the game I&#39;m running used it to fell a huge oak tree so the party could get at the bandits who were shooting at them them from its branches.</p>

        <p>Nah, common sense is for debate team. All your fantasy world has to be grounded in is genre appropriateness. Which may vary from table to table, to spectacular effect: <a href="http://youtu.be/lUQcS4xhhqo" class="ot-anchor">http://youtu.be/lUQcS4xhhqo</a><br /><br />Craziest thing I&#39;ve <i>actually</i> seen was a ten foot high adamantine door... which the GM let the Fighter try, and then on a 10+ said that she put a scratch in it and the point of her sword broke off. We set him straight, though; he was still learning about not letting moves trigger if they don&#39;t make sense in the fiction. Ah, memories. :P</p>

        <p>I&#39;d remind the player that he&#39;s Batman, not Superman. Exceptionally strong, but not superhumanly so.<br /><br />That said, I&#39;ll bet you Batman would find some way to use BB;LG to move that anvil. He just wouldn&#39;t be able to straight up lift it, a la Supes.</p>

        <p>All I know is next adventure I run needs a house sized anvil.</p>

        <p>....<br />&quot;Okay, sure.  This sounds like one of those once-in-a-lifetime, saved-the-day-and-will-be-forever-mourned deals. Bearing in mind I don&#39;t consider myself 100% tied to the recommended consequences of a failed roll, you can make one.  Anything less than a 10+ is going to have &#39;multiple ruptured spinal disks&#39; and &#39;paralyzed from the neck down&#39; consequences though (although you&#39;ll still get it done on a 7-9)&quot;</p>

        <p>A  solid cube of Iron 10 feet on a side would weigh 491,600 lbs. - nearly 250 tons (that&#39;s 223,000 kg, for you metric-lovin&#39; folk.)<br /><br />Unless your fighter also turns green when he gets angry, wish him good luck.</p>

        <p>It does naturally depend on the scale and scope of the game. If the fighter is a Herakles type, then impossible feats of physical prowess are a given (I divert the river to clean the stables, I hold up the sky while the Titan does me a favour), then lifting hundreds of tonnes of metal isn&#39;t all that implausible for the character.<br /><br />If he&#39;s more a Jaime Lannister type, then not so much with the impossible weightlifting.<br /><br />I&#39;m personally more inclined to the former, in any game where reality-bending wizard player characters are a thing.</p>

        <p>Don&#39;t allow a roll if he is not going to succeed. &quot;I lift the house sized anvil&quot;. Answer, &quot;Yea sure. What are you smoking?&quot;</p>
