<b>Is tracking rations worthwhile?</b><br /><br />We&#39;ve been tracking rations in our DW game for a long time now (or at least the characters that consume rations have).  Whenever we encounter a merchant we buy some more and there is the occasional mention of something unpleasant someone has to eat if they run out.<br /><br />However, aside from those occasional moments of minor color, I don&#39;t recall when tracking rations ever making a real difference to the game.  Even our haggling with merchants is based on when we encounter them in our travels, far more than our ration tracking.<br /><br />If anything, the few times running out of food would have added to the game, that avenue was close off by players still having spare rations.  Also, dying of starvation is such an ignominious end to an adventurer&#39;s life that I think GM and players alike would rather avoid this in favor of more glorious activities.<br /><br />All of which has me wonder if, instead of tracking rations, we&#39;d be better off requiring the party to haggle or search for food when it best fits the fiction of our game.<br /><br /><b>Do you track rations in your game?</b><br />- If so, is it worth the effort?<br />- If not, do you handwave that aspect of adventuring?<br />- Or do you do something else instead?

        <p>No tracking rations is boring and does not make the game better.</p>

        <p>I ran a game setting in which a desert was the main region that the group traversed through. There was a lush watery equator in this world and then harsh environments on either side. When they went to the desert, I made sure they kept track of rations because not only did this add some suspense, but it also made players aware that they might actually HAVE to return to a town rather than continue through the desert non-stop.<br /><br />They actually turned out to be the ones to keep track and discuss whether or not they had enough and always checked to make sure. They were quite low at some point and I began applying debilities when they did not have a ration and needed one.<br /><br />It was s small, subtle effect to the gameplay, but I think that should be its exact and entire purpose.</p>

        <p>Totally track rations (and bandages &amp; herbs/poultices) and its driven some of the most memorable moments in our campaign.<br /><br />It&#39;s a pacing mechanism.  It influences how long the PCs can stay out in the wild/dungeon without having to either go hunting or return to town.  And that in turn leads to all sorts of things changing in the world and the dungeon.<br /><br />I probably wouldn&#39;t track them in an urban game, or a globetrotting airship style game. But for actual wilderness exploration &amp; dungeon delving, hells yes.</p>

Which is fine (though you&#39;ll need to find something else for the quartermaster to do in the <b>Perilous Journey</b> move, or just drop the role). <span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink" href="https://plus.google.com/104189990280791735571" oid="104189990280791735571">Tim Callahan</a></span> seems to agree with you.<br /><br />Ration tracking is one of those things that, like many things in DW, only  becomes interesting if you <i>choose</i> to make it interesting. If the characters run out of food and the worst that happens is they spend some time foraging for food, time that gets hand waved away, then I wouldn&#39;t bother. But if you make not having enough food an issue, like in <span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink" href="https://plus.google.com/100476170927206311405" oid="100476170927206311405">Damian Jankowski</a></span>&quot;s desert example, then it becomes interesting.<br /><br />So, basically, ration tracking is worthwhile if you decide to <i>make</i> it worthwhile. :)</p>

        <p>Is scarcity a theme in your campaign? Or does one of the PCs&#39; moves model trade or acquisition of resources? Is one of your players a bean-counter?<br /><br />If so, <b>definitely</b> track rations. (Get the bean-counter to do it, if you have one.) Otherwise, it&#39;s up to you. Is the additional colour worth the work? How do your players feel about doing it?</p>

        <p>It&#39;s certainly a given in anything I run (which tends to lean towards the gritty yet weird end of things).<br /><br />The choice to simply Make Camp becomes a major game changer when you need those rations to Perilously Journey yourselves back to base after a good long dungeon looting spree. Go off now while you&#39;re still hurt and tired, rest up first at the risk of running low on supplies later or look around for extra food before you leave and maybe run into something that&#39;s got the same idea regarding you?<br /><br />Decisions, decisions...</p>

        <p>Oh, yeah. The problem might be that they&#39;re randomly bumping into merchants enough that they can resupply rather than Perilous Journey back to town, and that those merchants aren&#39;t charging impossible danger premiums or serious favors.<br /><br />Mind you, don&#39;t have well stocked merchants smugly charge impossible premiums in the wilderness, unless you&#39;re keen on the party turning into bandits on the spot.</p>

        <p>Sorry, yes. It&#39;s not tired directly to Perilous Journeying, but the fiction will basically demand some sort of interesting adventure, such as a Perilous Journey, when you run low on food.</p>

        <p>My group prefers a bit of a pulpy approach to things, so whenever they undergo a perilous journey and the quartermaster flunks his roll, I tell them they all get hungry on the way there. Depending on the circumstances they either take -1 ongoing on all rolls that involve physical strength until they eat something (if they&#39;re in the wilderness/a town and they can hunt, scavenge or buy something) or, in case they were about to dungeon delve, I tell them they forgot/lost their rations and about halfway through the dungeon this -1 ongoing effect will happen. They felt this was a fair compromise between their suspension of disbelief and still giving food/the quartermaster some relevance.</p>

        <p>Eating a ration is assumed/required for the Make Camp move... I&#39;d say that eating a ration (or buying a meal at an inn) is required for natural daily healing. It&#39;s hard to get proper rest on an empty stomach.  If you don&#39;t pay the cost you don&#39;t get the benefit.<br /><br />I&#39;d further suggest that failing to eat a ration should cause a debility for each day missed, and you starve (Last Breath) after a number of days equal to your Constitution.<br /><br />Tracking rations is not hard. If people dislike marking their character sheets, use poker chips or jelly beans to track rations.</p>

        <p>*TLDR: Ration tracking suits dungeon/wilderness delving from a base. <br />If you&#39;re using DW for other types of campaign, then (running out of) food may be better handled in other ways.*<br /><br />There seem to be three recurring themes in the posts so far:<br />1. Tracking rations causes parties to take breaks from their dungeon/ wilderness delving = <span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink" href="https://plus.google.com/102595580176380683252" oid="102595580176380683252">Jeremy Strandberg</a></span>&#39;s &quot;pacing mechanism&quot;.<br />2. Tracking rations causes parties to spend time &#39;hunting&#39; for food if they can&#39;t get back to town to restock = food can become valuable loot<br />3. If they run out of rations they &#39;should&#39; suffer a penalty (house rule required) and, eventually, maybe even die.<br /> - although no one&#39;s cited an example of a character/party actually dying of starvation in a DW game.<br /><br />This makes rations a pacing and loot mechanism for dungeon and wilderness delving (the original design concept for DW).  The lack of examples of penalties applied for running out of food (one example of a -1 penalty, no examples of characters dying of starvation) suggests that it is almost exclusively used to make parties take breaks from delving.<br /><br />Why does this not seem to fit with the DW games my group has been playing?<br /><br />To date, our DW games have all featured long term quests involving significant travel between locations.  Instead of a base of operations, the party lives on the road, stopping at (usually remote) locations to do one-off dungeon/site delves before moving on to the next step of the quest. <br />Travel between locations often takes weeks, but the &#39;delves&#39; when we get there are resolved in hours (a day or two at most).  <br /><br />The pacing of our campaigns is set therefore, not by rations, but by the rhythm of the parties travels.  Which explains why DW&#39;s standard ration tracking system is a poor fit for our games.<br /><br />I think our campaigns would be better suited by dropping the standard ration tracking system and doing the following instead:<br />- The party has to restock rations, etc., at each town it encounters (adds color and &#39;realism&#39; to the game)<br />- If there&#39;s something a town can&#39;t supply, the party will have to do without that until the next town<br />- Running out of food becomes a move the GM can use on a failed Perilous Journey or delve roll (&#39;Use up their resources&#39;)</p>

        <p>Interesting. It sounds like the trips in your games largely &quot;follow the red line&quot; (ala Indiana Jones), skipping the intervening travel. <br /><br />Do you use the Undertake a Perilous Journey moves? Has anyone ever missed the Quartermaster roll? If so, what did you do as a GM move?</p>

        <p>I&#39;ve had it end up important, but only once, when using my house Underdark navigation rules. They consume rations more aggressively than PJ and involve getting hopelessly lost on occasion. </p>

        <p>What I personally liked about our fudged system was that I could consider the quartermaster&#39;s 6- roll as any other failed roll and come up with a hard move that fit the context.<br /><br />Losing rations is, as mentioned, not all that interesting, because players in this scenario will simply lose some coins later on replacing the rations. However, tellingplayers that they&#39;re a bit peckish at the dungeon&#39;s entrance, and then that they&#39;re starving and light-headed halfway through the dungeon, and offering them three choices, that is interesting. Will they eat the suspicious looking shrooms from the cavern wall as a temporary fix-me-up, or will they take their chances to kill a monster in the dungeon in their weakened state so they can cook its meat? Or simply push on and play it safe, relying more on thinking (for which they do not get the -1 penalty) than raw strength?<br /><br />Meanwhile, if the quartermaster fails on the way to a civilized place, this can lead to some roleplaying opportunities. All the respectable places in town have closed shop already. Will you get a snack at a seedy looking bar, or knock on people&#39;s doors to ask for food, or sleep on a hungry stomach? All of these things are narratively more interesting than tracking rations. (At least for my group.)</p>

        <p>Being able to make an appropriate GM move on a 6- for a Perilous Journey move is how it works normally. No need to fudge the system. ;)</p>

        <p>I reread the Perilous Journey move and you&#39;re right! Come to think of it, the only real fudging is actually in the 10+ result, because we can&#39;t reduce the number of rations used by one. What I do instead is give them some surplus cured meat to use as bait or whatever. It&#39;s a minimal change regardless. You can probably tell that we don&#39;t use that move very often!<br /><br />As for using rations when making camp... Our sessions usually aren&#39;t long enough for anyone to suggest making camp in the middle of it, so it&#39;s never come up.</p>

        <p>We never play with rations simply because it seems boring. We tried perilous journeys a few times and it was like, &quot;move on to the interesting stuff, for goodness sake!&quot;<br /><br />That said, I can totally see that some people can like that sort of mechanic.

        <p>My players just acquire extra rations even though a third of them don&#39;t need to eat...they just buy everything, carve all the kills, cast light on it and make the halfling hireling carry glowing meat into a troll cave for their own amusement...</p>
