I&#39;m probably asking this too late but... I am helping with the Polish version of Dungeon World that was recently translated. Right now we are correcting all errors and looking for some illustrators, so... how does the copyright stuff look like, when it comes to translating the core game? I know you can sell supplements and other additional stuff without problems, but what about the whole game in a different language? Can I even upload it for free?

        <p>Looking for Illustrators, eh? Check out Jakob Rebelka: <a href="http://shzrebelka.tumblr.com/" class="ot-anchor">http://shzrebelka.tumblr.com/</a> Bonus: He&#39;s Polish!</p>

        <p>Thanks, I know a lot of illustrators, but now the biggest problem is proof-reading and... well the copyright issues :-(</p>
