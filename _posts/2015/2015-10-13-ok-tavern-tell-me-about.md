        <p>I mean you can do a lot of cool psionic things just with reflavoring stuff you do in a thematic way but there are a lot of cool archetypes (and yes I am drawing from 4E DnD a lot here...) that the game doesn&#39;t do so well. </p>

Also, customers reviews might be biased, I assume, with a small user-base.<br />So probably the site would have a few moderators/trusted playtesters or reviewers. I assume a mod could add star(s) if a customer/user points out an online actual play or written review that makes sense and is not just a sales pitch or a single playtest from the author.<br />But again, I am just a demanding asshole and I wrote that because the original request in this thread did not specify any limit on what we wish for. Getting it, is another story :-) </p>

        <p>Instead of a site, there should be a site with the compiled playbooks that cover the various genres/worlds everyone likes to play in...from Robotech, to Final Fantasy, to Tolkien, Eberron, Shadowrun (like Sixth World), Full Metal Alchemist, etc...Then all we have to do is build them and submit to the site for playtest and evaluation from the community. This would allow all of us to pull from the various playbooks to compile more worlds to play in.</p>

Dungeon World does DnD type adventure. You can use it for other stuff but the system will always fight you. You can&#39;t just create a class for X and expect that the game will suddenly feel like that.<br /><br />Final Fantasy has very different asumptions and tropes than Dungeon World. If the game doesn&#39;t deliver these tropes it feels off and nothing in DW is there to get you to these tropes. <br />DW can easily do Anime DnD with impossible huge swords and all the jumping around but that wouldn&#39;t make it feel like playing FF. <br />You need way more hacking for that. <br /><br />Why should someone give out so much work for free? What you are looking for are different games, not different classes. </p>

No FF World is like another before or afterwards and most worlds are on the edge of change because of some terror regime and/or pending catastrophe.<br />A few characteristic specimen,  like Chocobos and Moogles.<br />Characteristic means of transportation. A boat and an airship can be found in most FF games ;)<br /><br />I don&#39;t know... I can&#39;t see the big difference between a group of a fighter, a thief, a black mage and a white mage or a fighter, a thief, a wizard and a cleric.<br /><br />And for a DW Final Fantasy setting, I would personally change the Agenda a bit.<br />- Portray a fantastic <b>and beautiful</b> World<br />- *Drag* the characters’ lives <b>into</b> adventure<br />- Play to find out what happens<br /><br />The Principles and GM Moves would also need a little nudging, but I believe I made my point ;) <br />[Oh, and Class Warfare holds the key, to the &#39;needed&#39; Playbooks to portray some specials like the Blue Mage]</p>

        <p>But when you play DnD you don&#39;t go out of town to grind a few random encounters to get enough gold for the next item bonus. <br /><br />You always hit when you attack (in most games)<br /><br />Positioning is super unimportant because people just stand around and then attack (minor thing but it feels different then moving miniatures on a map). <br /><br />Final Fantasy has super long SFX scenes within one combat while DnD has way shorter descriptions. <br /><br />Yes they use some of the same tropes but the sheer fact that they come from very different media creates very different gameplay. </p>

        <p>Grinding is prone to the console gaming character of being a digital game, but not to the theme of Final Fantasy. But even there positioning can be important (if just front and back row...)<br /><br />I stand to my point. There are a few things with are important for the feeling, but so has D&amp;D.<br />But if you concentrate on the basic ingredients it&#39;s just a group of troublemakers going on an adventure.</p>

        <p>It&#39;s absolutely possible to play DW in a final fantasy type world. I&#39;m surprised anyone might think it&#39;s not. You don&#39;t have to simulate the mechanics to emulate the feeling and themes of such settings IMHO.</p>

        <p>As I said you can do fantasy DW very easily but I don&#39;t think it feels the same. It may feel like the cutscenes though. </p>

        <p>I&#39;m pretty sure my players at least think of the cutscenes and story over the ever-increasing-numbers-combat.<br /><br />Also, something like final fantasy tactics (again, the setting and rich story) would work pretty well in DW</p>

        <p>I&#39;d like to see some incidental details the GM can throw in; not complete campaigns but individual interesting rooms or dungeon themes or NPCs or magic items. Something to pick up the slack when the players investigate a new blank spot or win an unexpected victory, or something to spark ideas.</p>
