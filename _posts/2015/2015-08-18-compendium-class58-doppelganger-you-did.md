<b>Compendium Class: Doppelganger</b><br /><br />You did the Take Watch move and several 6s later your dead at the hands of a Doppelganger!<br /><br />Wanted to make a class for this type of old trope, or maybe for a character who wandered off in a dungeon and then is met back in town. Could be used for other &quot;body snatched&quot; type scenarios as well.<br /><br /><b>When you are overcome and replaced by a Doppleganger</b> take this move next time you level up:<br /><br />A whole new man!<br /><br />When a Doppelganger behaves in a manner different then the person they are impersonating, roll+CHA. On a 10 or more you can explain it away as your new attitude/mindset/religious view, etc. On a 7-9 you hesitate too long or your facts are a little off. On a 6 or less it is clear you are doing something suspicious.<br /><br /><br />Some ideas for moves:<br /><br />Knowing what&#39;s next:<br />the Doppelganger&#39;s telepathic abilities often let it anticipate what&#39;s expected of them, as such you can always ask &quot;What is about to happen here?&quot; when Discerning Realities, even on a 6 or less.<br /><br />Faces in the crowd:<br />When you changes faces quickly to escape detection, roll+INT. On a 10+ you avoid detection.  On a 7-9 you aren&#39;t the guy they&#39;re are looking for, but there&#39;s something off about you. On a 6 or less the transformation has gone awry.<br /><br />Do I know you?<br />When you are approached by a victim&#39;s friend and they question you, roll+INT, in a 10+ your telepathy allows you to answer the question exactly as they expect you too. On a 7-9 you answer satisfies them for now, but hey still need convincing. On a 6 or less, you clearly have no idea what you are talking about.<br /><br />What&#39;s on your mind?<br />You have honed your telepathy to be able to read a little deeper than surface thoughts. When you have time and concentrate on scanning someone, roll+INT. On a 10+ you can ask 2 questions from the list below. On a 7-9 you can ask 1.<br /><br />-How does this person expect me to behave?<br />-What memories does this person share with my victim?<br />-What about me is not as they expect?<br />-How does this person feel about my victim?<br />-Are they being honest?<br />-What is their general mood?<br /><br /><br /><b>EDIT</b><br />New Alignment might be needed as well:<br />Evil: Shift blame or consequences by impersonating another.<br /><br />Chaotic: Benefit yourself by creating confusion or paranoia<br /><br />Neutral: Stay safe by imitating another<br /><br /><br /><br />Just kind of spit-balling with it at this point. Any and all help appreciated.

        <p>I really like the idea.  I&#39;m hesitant in having mechanical moves tied to how well a player can negotiate / spitball answers?  I think a &#39;using your telepathy&#39; caveat to the Do I Know You move would alleviate my concerns.  (Also - consider &#39;close acquaintance&#39; instead of &#39;friend&#39;.  It allows employers, lovers, children, servants, etc)</p>

        <p>Yeah a lot of power in the verbage, and I feel some moves overlap.</p>
