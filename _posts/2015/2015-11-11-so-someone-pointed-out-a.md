So someone pointed out a discrepancy about Cleric HP. In the playbooks it&#39;s listed as 6+Constitution and in the rule book it is 8+Constitution. Why is that? Was there a typo in the rule book?

        <p>HP is always equal to your damage dice.</p>

        <p>But on the playbooks;<br />Barbarian is d10 damage and 8+constitution health<br />Thief is d8 damage and 6+constitution health<br />Immolator is d8 damage and 4+constitution health<br /><br />Where is the HP is equal to damage dice rule? Which direction does it go? Does the immolator roll a d4 or does it have 8+constitution health?</p>

        <p>I might be wrong on this but thought that applies to all classes. Just something I remember... Weird.</p>

        <p>I noticed that as soon as i started playing on roll20. I figure it was an error in developing the .pdf character sheets.<br /><br />I tend to err in favor of the printed book (unless a mistake is obvious or subsequently corrected in official errata), and also err in favor of the players&#39; interest. Â In this case, both would mean giving The Cleric 8+ Constitution.</p>

        <p>Yea, I personally figure Cleric&#39;s have the greater health point amount. The reason being, I think of old school clerics and how they were essentially less good fighters who wore plate, couldn&#39;t use edged weapons and learned spells at level 2.</p>

        <p>They have 8, based on the old school Cleric which had a d8 hit die.  HP and damage die are unrelated.</p>

        <p>The Barbarian has a d8 HP and d10 damage die. The Cleric has a d8 HP and d6 damage die. The Thief has a d6 HP and d8 damage die.</p>
