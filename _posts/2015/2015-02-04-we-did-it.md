We did it! We hit the first stretch goal for <b>The Green Law of Varkith</b>! That means we&#39;re that much closer to creating three whole books for this Kickstarter, which is absolutely awesome! Let&#39;s keep it going!

Mark Diaz Truman is raising funds for The Last Days of Anglekite, a Chaos World from Magpie Games on Kickstarter! 

 A weird fantasy setting book for Dungeon World. You are heroes who use terrible powers to defend your lands from strange, epic threats.

        <p>If Lastlife and Varkith are half as good as the Anglekite backer draft is, you&#39;d have to be a little silly not to at least pledge at the digital level.  I&#39;m already void of disappointment. I&quot;m not even saying that because I want a chance at a physical copy of the Varkith setting, but the current backer draft book looks super. </p>
