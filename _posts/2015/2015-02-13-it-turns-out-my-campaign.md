It turns out my campaign front is revolving around dark forces and devil worshiping cults.  Here&#39;s a custom move I plan to use.  Originally I wrote it for a specific book, but I thought I&#39;d generalize it.<br /><br />When you <b>spend</b> <b>a</b> <b>day</b> <b>of</b> <b>downtime</b> <b>reading</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>blasphemous</b> <b>pages</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>vile</b> <b>book</b>, roll +WIS.  On a success the GM will tell you a valuable and useful piece of secret information regarding the book&#39;s subject.  On a 7-9 select one below:<br />	• You read about a particularly disgusting ritual, take the Sick Debility (cannot choose this if you are already Sick).<br />	• You read about infernal forces, the knowledge of which plagues your thoughts.  Take the Confused Debility (cannot choose this if you are already Confused).<br />	• A foul presence touches your mind.<br />	• The book disintegrates in your hands.<br /><br />My idea for the foul presence is that a diabolical force will gain 1 Hold on the PC, and can claim that Hold to cause the PC to perform an action that it desires at a later time.

        <p>I don&#39;t like the sound of just telling your players what their character does, that is definitely not Being a Fan. <br /><br />Instead, why not take a leaf from AW: when you spend hold you give them a choice, do what you say and mark experience or disobey and act under fire(the fail result should never be they do the thing!) It gives the players a little more agency while still making following your command a bit easier.</p>
