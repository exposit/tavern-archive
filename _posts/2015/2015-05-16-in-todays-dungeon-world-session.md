In today&#39;s <i>Dungeon World</i> session, the heroes chased spider queen cultists through the night-darkened streets of the city to rescue Oomfoofoo, Queen of Beggars. During the pitched final battle against a giant spider and two cult assassins, Romeo, my bard, lost the use of his shield after the giant spider sprayed Romeo with webbing, effectively sticking Romeo&#39;s shield arm to his own chest. Undaunted, Romeo rammed into a cult assassin, sticking the assassin to the webbing as well. Via a series of phenomenal hack-and-slash rolls, the 9-Strength bard then proceeded to headbutt the cult assassin to death. Romeo&#39;s fury at Oomfoofoo&#39;s rough treatment by the assassins knew no bounds. Huzzah.
