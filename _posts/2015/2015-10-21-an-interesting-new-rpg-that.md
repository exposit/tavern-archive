        <p>I love the art. The coin concept is cute, but I might just use dice - sounds like it would be easily transferrable. I don&#39;t so much love the races as insect-people, tree-people, stone-people, etc. Making non-anthropocentric races would undoubtedly be more difficult, but also likely more interesting.</p>
