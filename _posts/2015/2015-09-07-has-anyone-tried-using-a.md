Has anyone tried using a d12 instead of 2d6?  I know the average of 7 is what the 2d6 aims at, but would d12 make the game that much harder?

        <p>It wouldn&#39;t make it harder, just more random.</p>

        <p>it would make failure way more likely (also, you can roll a 1 now)</p>

        <p>like, if you have a +1 to a stat:<br /><br />with 2d6, your chances of getting a <br />10+ are 5/18<br />7-9 are 4/9<br />6- are 5/18 (28%)<br /><br />with 1d12 your chances are<br />10+: 1/3<br />7-9:  1/4<br />6-: 5/12 (42%)</p>

        <p>People always trying to find a way to use their d12s :)</p>

        <p>It isn&#39;t just the average of 7, but rather the distribution of rolls.<br /><br />On a d12, you have a 1-in-12 chance of rolling any number, 1 - 12.<br />On 2d6, you have a 1-in-36 chance to roll a 2 ( two 1s) or a 12 (two 6s), a 2-in-36 chance to roll a 3 (1/2 or 2/1)or 11 (5/6 or 6/5).  You have much greater odds of rolling toward the middle of the range,  which means a much greater chance of a natural roll of a high fail or 7-9, depending on your modifiers. <br /><br />Switching to a d12 normalizes the distribution,  which would mean you roll a natural 6- as often as a 7+.  You also have a chance at a natural 1, which increases your odds at a 6- over using 2d6.<br /><br />So. .. 1 d12 screws up the math, not in they players&#39; favor.   That is enough reason for me not to switch.  What I cannot figure out is if there is a reason to switch from 2d6.  Is 2d6 problematic at your table?   Or was this just asked out of curiosity?</p>

        <p>The thing about Moves is, if you want to alter the results, you can change the granularity of the Move itself instead of the dice. For example, everyone can Defy Danger with Strength, but Fighters can Bend Bars/Lift Gates, which is <i>better</i> in some situations. Same dice, 100% compatibility, but with greater effectiveness. You can do the same by writing a custom 2d6 Move for anything. </p>

        <p>If you&#39;re like me you might like the probability changes in chart form rather than in writing :P <a href="http://anydice.com/program/535" class="ot-anchor">http://anydice.com/program/535</a></p>

        <p>1d12 means every roll is random.  You have as much a chance of rolling a 1 as you do rolling a 12.  A 2d6 has a bell-curve that clusters rolls into the 5-9 range with a 7 being the most common.</p>

        <p>So I got distracted today after remembering how Tavern Tales uses a 3 roll, take the middle result system to create a bell curve and wondered if that might help for utilising a d12. With a bit of number crunching (and a lot of help from anydice), I decided to work out all the probability stuff solely in regards to <i>unmodified</i> rolls and only in terms of the <i>chance of getting a miss, partial success or success</i>.<br /><br />With <b>2d6</b> the chances of each outcome are:<br />Miss: 41.67%<br />Partial success: 41.67%<br />Success: 16.67%<br /><br />When rolling <b>3d12 and taking the middle result</b> the chances are:<br />Miss: 50%<br />Partial success: 34.37%<br />Success: 15.63%<br /><br />I did some quick musing about whether there was any way to alter the &quot;3d12 take middle result&quot; method so as to push the percentages a bit closer to regular 2d6 chances. I found that if you treat a roll of 3 as a partial success (don&#39;t ask me how any of this works in practice xP), you get percentages fairly close to the regular outcomes:<br /><br />When rolling <b>3d12 and taking the middle result </b><b><i>and</i></b><b> treating a natural 3 as a partial success</b> the chances are:<br />Miss: 41.78%<br />Partial success: 42.49%<br />Success: 15.63%<br /><br />Again, not at all sure how this works in practice (I only tested the chances for unmodified rolls) and I&#39;m not sure where exactly 3 lies between 7-9 when it comes to adding modifiers. I kinda just worked it out because it felt like a silly thing to do :P</p>
