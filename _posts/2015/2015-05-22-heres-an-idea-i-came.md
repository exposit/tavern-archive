Here&#39;s an idea I came up with to get some quick world building done during the first session of a campaign.<br /><br />When you build a piece of the world, roll +INT.  Continue taking turns defining world features until everyone has had a turn, and there is at least one positive, negative, and terrain feature created.<br />	• On a 10+, create a positive features on the map.  This can be a friendly fortress, safe haven steading, or other bastion of the precarious civilization.<br />	• On a 7-9, create a region of terrain on the map, such as a forest, desert, sea, or mountain range.<br />	• On a 6 or less, create a negative feature on the map.  This can be the stronghold of a lich king, a cursed barrow mound, a forsaken dungeon complex, etc.  These sites invariably contain wealth and artifacts ripe for adventurers to plunder.

        <p>Hmm... I really like the concept, but are the characters themselves creating the world?  If not, it seems odd to tie the world-at-large to a Stat block of the character.<br /><br />I might steal this for my toyed with (and stolen) idea for a DW hack about people playing a DW hack.</p>

        <p>I considered making it a straight 2d6 but I want to use it also as a way to introduce the new players to the core mechanic.  But I see your point :)</p>

        <p>In DW i typically prefer building only the bits of the world the characters are looking at right now.  The rest of it is under &#39;fog of war&#39;, becoming defined only once it&#39;s relevant in the fiction.<br /><br />The exception would be the way Funnel World approaches village design.  The collaborative aspect of developing a handful of characters, and then building a village to support why THOSE characters happen to be present was a great exercise.  great lite system, and it actually taught me a new way to think about building a village around the resource(s) that caused people to settle there in the first place (and possibly/hopefully enabled them to thrive)<br /><br />I guess i&#39;d characterize  Funnel World&#39;s approach as making a few random rolls to assert a bunch of fiction up front, and then using that fiction to fill in relevant gaps on a map.....  hmmm... new concept to throw around in my dizzy head.</p>

        <p>This seems redundant, seeing how most class moves include describing parts of the world anyway. <br /><br />If you really want to present the core mechanic to the new players just prepare a nice starting move for the possible adventures you would like to present. I really like the example set here: <a href="https://youtu.be/ooa-apRt2wk?t=1904" class="ot-anchor">https://youtu.be/ooa-apRt2wk?t=1904</a></p>

        <p>I want the players to come up with the adventure ideas, not present something to them, I want to go in with a clean slate and let us build the ideas together.</p>
