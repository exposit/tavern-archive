Probability of modified 2d6 rolls.<br /><br />Hey DW people. I&#39;m not so great at statistical math... Can anyone help me figure out what the probabilities are of rolling any given number on a modified 2d6 roll? I&#39;ve seen the straight 2d6 charts before, but how does that look with the modifiers?

        <p>I&#39;ve no idea how to read the charts, but I guess I bookmarked this a while ago :P <a href="http://fsckme.zehta.me/2014/03/dungeon-world-dice-probabilities.html" class="ot-anchor">http://fsckme.zehta.me/2014/03/dungeon-world-dice-probabilities.html</a></p>

        <p>I don&#39;t know if this is relevant, but when designing custom moves, change the granularity of the moves themselves instead of the dice probabilities. It prevents a lot of confusion.</p>

        <p>The probabilities of each roll stays the same but the value associated with each probability slides up and down by the modifier. <a href="http://anydice.com/program/4725" class="ot-anchor">http://anydice.com/program/4725</a></p>

        <p>Right, that&#39;s what one of those colourful graphs<br /> that <span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink" href="https://plus.google.com/100606522533840157681" oid="100606522533840157681">Em0srawk</a></span> posted says. +3 is a pretty huge advantage... Something to keep in mind I guess...</p>

        <p>The following puts some context around the probabilities:<br /><br /><b>+5</b> is superman territory: the character <i>cannot</i> fail, and only 1/6 rolls will be 7-9; everything else will be 10+<br /><br /><b>+4</b> is true mastery: 10+ results will dominate (72%; vs 25% for 7-9 results) and the character will almost never fail (only 1/36 chance)<br /><br /><b>+3</b> is probably the sweet spot for something the character is expert at: successful a lot of the time, 10+ approx 60% of the time, with only the occasional fail (1/12 chance of a fail)<br /><br /><b>+2</b> is good for something the character has a decent competence at: successful most of the time; 40% of rolls will be 10+; but expect a fail every few rolls (~50% chance every 3-4 rolls)<br /><br /><b>+1</b> means the character will usually do ok, but not great: rolls are mostly successful with 27% getting to 10+,  however fails are common (~50% chance every 2 rolls)<br /><br /><b>+0</b> is risky: while the character has ~60% chance of success, they have only 1/6 chance of getting a 10+, and fails will be frequent (every two or three rolls).<br /><br /><b>-1</b> is asking for trouble: the character will fail more often than not, and has only a 1/12 chance of rolling a 10+<br /><br /><b>-2</b> is getting desperate: the character will fail 72% of the time, and has only 1/36 chance of getting a 10+<br /><br /><b>-3</b> is last ditch rolling: the character has an 83% chance of failing and even the best success will still only produce a 7-9.<br /><br />It&#39;s worth remembering, too, that the more characters have to roll, the more likely they are to fail.<br />For example: while a single +1 roll has only 28% chance of failing, making the character roll twice to achieve the result they want increases their chance of rolling a fail to almost 50%.</p>
