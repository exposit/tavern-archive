I just gave my players a teleporting spyglass.  When they look through it, then take it from their eye, they&#39;re suddenly in the place they were looking at.  <br />I could use some help coming up with a custom move for it.  The players were talking about travelling quickly through a forest (the world is very foresty, think Kashyyyk), scout ahead or ambush people, but I figure they&#39;re likely to fall into a trap or get lost that way, especially with one person travelling alone.  Any ideas?

        <p>When you peer through the eyeglass of Franklin, roll +wis:<br />On a 10+, choose 3. On a 7-9, choose one:<br />-- You arrive where you want.<br />-- Everyone you want to join you is able to do so.<br />-- No one suffers harm.<br />-- You arrive unnoticed.<br /><br />Maybe something like that.</p>

        <p>I was thinking along those lines.  Maybe with<br />- You can find your way back.<br />- The spyglass isn&#39;t out of juice.</p>

        <p>Good options! If it is out of juice, do you have a recharge mechanic?<br /><br />I&#39;d probably opt out of the recharge mechanic, because I want them to keep rolling. The GM moves from a 6- on THAT thing? Amazing.</p>

        <p>You have to recharge it by using the spyglass to gaze upon something no mortal has ever seen before.</p>

        <p>Honestly, there&#39;s no need for a specific move.<br />Fictional positioning should be enough of a limit for you.<br />Is it too dark?<br />Do you have a clear line of sight?<br />Do you have to speak a special word, or does this effect happen every time you look, even if you don&#39;t want to teleport?<br /><br />Magic items should always be more narrative than mechanical, theyr&#39;e magic. They break the rules just by existing.</p>

        <p>I&#39;d use Shepard and Etheridge&#39;s recommendations - it works when it would work, until it doesn&#39;t.  Then they need to forgo it or figure out how to fix it.<br /><br />I would also consider all the delicious soft/hard moves to be made because they have this.  Using it to escape a fight?  Defying Danger - a miss might see them 500 meters in the air halfway between the battle and where they wanted to be.  A thief in the city steals it while they&#39;re parlaying with some corrupt guards - how do they chase her down / get it back?</p>
