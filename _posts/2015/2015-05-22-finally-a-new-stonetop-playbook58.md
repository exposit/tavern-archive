Finally, a new  <a rel="nofollow" class="ot-hashtag" href="https://plus.google.com/s/%23Stonetop/posts">#Stonetop</a>  playbook: <b>The Blessed</b>.<br /><br />This is the town&#39;s nature &quot;priest,&quot; a sort of shaman/druid/cleric. I had a dickens of a time figuring out what, exactly, I wanted it to be.  The Stonetop setting is meant to be fairly low (or subtle) magic for the PCs, at least to start.  You won&#39;t find any of the playbooks shapeshifting or casting magic missiles.<br /><br />As it is, there are <b>two fairly different versions</b> of this playbook, and I&#39;m really interested to hear folks&#39; opinions about which one they prefer. The first is a &quot;standard&quot; class, where pretty much all the class&#39;s schticks come from their moves.  The second is closer to a spellcaster, but with &quot;secret marks&quot; instead of spells.  <br /><br />So, anyhow... have a look and let me know what you think.  <br /><br />Cheers!

        <p>I don&#39;t like spell lists for DW, so I&#39;m going with the first one. :-) I love that you can essentially play as all three Daughters of Danu. That&#39;s pretty great.</p>

        <p>While I like both versions, I&#39;m a sucker for the flavor of the Secret Marks.</p>
