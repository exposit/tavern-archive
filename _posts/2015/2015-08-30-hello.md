Hello! :D I&#39;m new to DW and not english speaking, so don&#39;t be mad pls. I&#39;m GMing and I made my first campaign fron, and I want to know what do you think about it. <br />The game is taking place in small country surrounded by mountains, and players are heading to the capital city to their sanctuary, because there is paladin and priest with the same religon, I made out a front called <br />Gor&#39;hal&#39;s awekening<br />1st danger is it&#39;s cult which is trying to take over control capital city to be ready for when Gor&#39;hal comes on earth. <br />doom is tyranny and grim portents are:<br />-sending bandits to attack tracks and villages to make king sent soldiers out of cities.<br />-recruit own micro-army<br />-bribe capital city watch, maybe even use magic on them to make them obedient to cult&#39;s will<br />-assasination of king<br />-coup d&#39;état<br /><br />second danger is Gor&#39;hal himself who&#39;s gonna descend on earth to kill his opponents etc<br />grim portents are:<br />-climat changes what shows god&#39;s intervention into the world<br />-choosing the vessel for Gor&#39;hal to descend<br />-making potential vessels meet and fight - choosing the winner<br />- god&#39;s spirit descends on this human beeing take control over his cult and make an apocalypse<br /><br />What do you think? Is it good enough/bad/does it need some changes? I&#39;ll be glad for everything. :)

        <p>I&#39;d say it&#39;s pretty solid base which could need some adjustments. Cultists could blackmail guards and/or important nobles, desecrate sanctuaries of other gods so the gods power weakens in the city. Something like that. Who could say... maybe players own sanctuary will be among the first ones on the list? </p>

Thank you! :)</p>

        <p>Hey, what&#39;s that &quot;etc&quot;?!? Show more respect to  the Great Gor&#39;hal!!<br /><br />I really like the God&#39;s danger. It&#39;s solid, open, and offers the PCs ways to interact. You know, if players can do nothing to stop/interfere, it&#39;s bad; but these are PORTENTS, so sometimes, there must be this big bell ringing DOOM, DOOM.<br />You can definitely play on this dangers; just be sure you tie your players in by asking questions on questions. Put the answers they give you in the front; names, dates, details.<br /><br />And ASK those details! Be a pain in the... with questions.<br />- A paladin<br />- What&#39;s his name?<br />- where is he now?<br />- Why?<br />are you two friends?<br />Just friends?<br /><br />have a nice game</p>

        <p>I&#39;d make it personal. Portents strike harder when they are connected to the players.<br />*The bandits attack one of the PC&#39;s home village<br />*The micro army recruits gullible clerics (friends of the priest) to their cause and so they try and convince the PC to do the same.<br />*The PC&#39;s favourite tavern in swamped with culties, trying to bribe the city watch while they drink.<br /><br />That sort of thing.</p>
