Something terrible has befallen the young King of Carronis, and has cast the entire kingdom into disarray. Now, you and your party have been tasked with finding and eliminating a strange shadowy-figure out in the wilderness. A storm is devestating your land, and your guide has died suddenly. There are at least a dozen orcs surrounding you, and your only advantage - the Tome of Maliece, is not to be trusted. Welcome to Adventures in Jimmya. The world is yours.


Dungeon World works to eliminate unnecessary die-rolls and encourages active player participation through use of the game's guiding principles (including "Draw Maps, Leave Blanks", and "Ask Questions, use the answers"). It is a very approachable game to those new to role-playing, and those experienced players looking for a little looser structure. Generally speaking, it's very workable for one-shot adventures, and allows players to be genuinely awesome immediately.


For my adventures (The Adventures in Jimmya), I ask players to considera series of questions we will answer together at the table. This willhappen during the first 30 minutes, and will happen in conjunction withcharacter generation. After that, we will move through an approximately 3 hours of play with a final 30 minutes for an epilogue discussion).

Here are the questions to consider:
1) What terrible fate befell the young King of Carronis?
2) Who is the shadowy man in black? What makes him so dangerous?
3) What is the name of the Orc Warband leader, and why is he your best hope of survival?
4) What good is the Tome of Maliece, and what curse does it carry? Also, who's holding it?

See you at the table!

Note : the player limit is 4. At this time, we have a full table!
