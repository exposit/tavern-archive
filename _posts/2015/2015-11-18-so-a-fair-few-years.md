so a fair few years ago i played / ran <b>a lot</b> of Talislanta 3rd Edition.<br />To make monsters / matters easier i condensed down a load of monsters and converted a load of Diablo 2 mobs to T3 stats and put them on these nifty T-cards. i also had a folder that would carry about 30 or so in easy to access format. theyre also colour coded to what &quot;type&quot; of monster it is (Beast / demon / undead etc), and sorting through my old gaming boxes i have re found them... <br /><br />given that i have the day off today and the weather is too bad for me to play too much Ingress (big joke there..) i&#39;m going to see about repurposing the cards for DW<br /><br />given the simplicity of DW mobs has anyone else tried index cards for reference?

        <p>I keep all my encounters on 3x5 index cards which I keep rubber banded together until needed...I&#39;m a functional low cost kind of guy.</p>

        <p>I write all my Impending dooms on mini-index cards with a cool illustration, then pile the grim portents on top (as seperate cards). These sit around the main map, and as they advance, I take one of the cards off the top and reveal the next grim portent until finally the Impending doom. Adds delicious tension, especially when there is that &#39;damned if I do, damned if I don&#39;t&#39; choice  for the players between combatting one front or another.</p>
