<b>Ring of Bloody Futures</b><br /> <a rel="nofollow" class="ot-hashtag" href="https://plus.google.com/s/%23MagicItemMonday/posts">#MagicItemMonday</a> <br /><br />When the Ring of Bloody Futures is worn and turned one full rotation around the finger, the character takes 1d4 damage from the small blades in it. If the ring is then put on a flat surface and spun like a top, the center of the ring will show a vision of the next time violence will be visited upon the character.<br /><br />Yes I know it&#39;s not Monday.

        <p>How do you translate those visions in play procedures?Â </p>

        <p>However you want to handle divination in your game. Is the future absolute or are the visions merely one of several possible outcomes?<br /><br />Spin to find out what happens!</p>

        <p>Love it. I think if I were to use it, I&#39;d give the blood donor +1 hold that could only be spent when and if the vision comes true.</p>
