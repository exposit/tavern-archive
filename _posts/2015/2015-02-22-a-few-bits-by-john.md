A few bits by <span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink" href="https://plus.google.com/102241355698439183778" oid="102241355698439183778">John Harper</a></span> on Damage in World of Dungeons and Dungeon World <br /><br />If it&#39;s a fight, I deal damage on 6- and trade blows on 7-9. It&#39;s not my problem that they only have 3 hp. Don&#39;t think about &quot;challenges.&quot; Don&#39;t make your opponents limp punching bags. Follow through on the fiction (the fiction being <b>super-deadly dungeon delving</b>).<br /><br />If dealing damage is boring, you&#39;re doing it wrong.<br /><br />(Definitely use Last Breath if you want a bit less death. That&#39;s much better than toning down damage or making wussy monsters who don&#39;t usually deal damage. But death is part of a classic dungeon crawl game. &quot;Everyone make your first character&quot; I always say when we start.)<br /><br /><br /><span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink" href="https://plus.google.com/117415966179711277938" oid="117415966179711277938">Sage LaTorra</a></span>  adds: <br /><br />HP is, partially, a timer on how long you can fight. Death or Last Breath is what happens when that timer runs out.<br /><br />Messing with HP or damage messed with the tempo, which may not be what you want to do. It makes fights longer or shorter.<br /><br /><br />Back to <span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink" href="https://plus.google.com/102241355698439183778" oid="102241355698439183778">John Harper</a></span> <br /><br /> I just usually deal HP damage, too (if it&#39;s a fight). You can&#39;t deal damage without saying what happens, anyway -- which usually means escalating the situation and placing them in greater danger. You don&#39;t ever just say, &quot;You take 3 damage&quot; (obviously) and when you say, &quot;The Ogre grabs you by the leg and hurls you across the room,&quot; I find it weird to not also say, &quot;You take 3 damage.&quot;<br /><br />What I try to avoid as GM (this is my style, not the mandate of the game design) is eyeballing PC hit points and then making moves to be sure I don&#39;t kill them. I find that annoying as a player and it runs counter to the gritty dungeon-delve vibe I try to cultivate. (Blake&#39;s method with the kids is perfect for that group, but not what I want in my game.)<br /><br /><br />Trading damage (in a back-and-forth fight, remember) on a 7-9 is standard Dungeon World hack and slash.<br /><br />It sucks, agreed. Which is how the PCs learn that you don&#39;t stand toe to toe and fight things that can kill you. If you attack them some other way, of course, the 7-9 result is different. This isn&#39;t a rule (7-9 means damage!) it&#39;s an application of the general rule, given a set of specific circumstances.<br /><br />You can read the whole thing here. <br /><a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/18549/world-of-dungeons-what-are-you-using-for-monsters" class="ot-anchor">http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/18549/world-of-dungeons-what-are-you-using-for-monsters</a> <br /><br />Expect me to do a lot more damage going forward.

        <p>I LOVE to deal damage AND make a monster move. Heh Heh. Then the narrative positioning of the monster move is re-inforced by the inevitable HP countdown to death and madness.</p>

        <p>Okay for some, I guess. I&#39;m perfectly fine with eyeballing, and find character death to be the most boring consequence to inflict for 99% of all scenarios.</p>

        <p>But it is their fault for going for it right? When they know the danger than they can play around that. Get a healer. Get healing potions. It&#39;s not like the GM is actively trying to kill you. </p>

        <p>Meh. Say what the fiction demands, sure, but &quot;everyone make your first character&quot;? That might get a pass in World of Dungeons, but in Dungeon World, heck no.<br /><br />Dungeon World characters, for my money, are high fantasy goddamn superheroes, not slowly-draining hourglasses that come in six-packs.<br /><br />Damage is fine, it&#39;s tense, but all those other moves on the GM sheet are there for a reason too.<br /><br /><b>shrug</b> Different strokes.</p>

        <p>Dealing damage is just one of the options on 7-9. Disarm, stun, disable, push, throw of balance, blind... There are so many ways of having fun in a combat than just ticking the countdown.</p>

        <p>Monster Move. A lot of them include damage. ﻿<br /><br />Also if something is happening to you in the fiction that implies damage than you should take damage. The fiction is descriptive/prescriptive like that.</p>

        <p>I disagree - I don´t think that anything that could conceivably do physical damage in the real world (such as it is) should translate as ticks on the countdown counter (ie. lost HP) in DW. I see HP as a specific tool for a specific purpose, not a physics simulation.<br /><br />I also usually don´t throw in damage as extra to a monster Move unless it is an inseparable part of it - getting lit on fire from the dragon´s magical napalm breath should definitely do it, for one. That I choose to desrcibe a &quot;separate them&quot; as the ogre rushing the Fighter so that they both crash through a wall? Forget about damage there - it just detracts from the drama of the moment by adding some extraneous beancounting.l</p>

        <p>So wait, just so I understand (and I&#39;m not sure I do), to use Tim&#39;s example above, you&#39;d have the ogre hurling you across the room deal no damage, and then use the DM &quot;Deal damage&quot; as a separate action, after the player had had an opportunity to react?  I&#39;m just getting my head wrapped around GMing DW, but this doesn&#39;t make sense to me.  How did the player get thrown across the room without taking any damage?  You guys are confusing the heck out of the new guy here!</p>

        <p>Basically - healing potions completely suck. They are a tool in a video game, not a sensible part of the world. It does not make any sense to just guzzle potions down mid combat as a way to alleviate difficulty. <br /><br />Not only are they fictionally shit, they also lower tension and lower the impact of damage. </p>

        <p>For me, it´s... well, it varies by context, where context can be the <b>individual game</b>. If people wanted to play something grittier and Dark Dungeon-esque, then being thrown around the room by the ogre would probably deal damage as well as, I dunno, snap your leg.<br /><br />Mostly, we´re using DW for more adventure fiction-ish games. If the Fighter goes through the wall with the charging ogre (as per above), the important thing there is the separation move - the rest is basically just color, and I see no reason to start to throw in HP damage. Basically, individual Moves should be interesting and dramatic enough without diluting attention by throwing in secondary effects - and &quot;dealing damage&quot; is the most boring Move I know, so it gets used less often.</p>
