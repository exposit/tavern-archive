Behold, the Merchant-Adventurer!  A new class I worked up, basically untested.  It should have the option of playing in a few different ways:  as a medieval-ish take on the Apocalypse World Operator, or as a pirate captain, or as a fast-talking rogue with lots of options on Parley.<br /><br />A couple non-standard notes:  the &quot;Races&quot; are cultures from my game world, since I find the standard Dwarf/Elf/Halfling kind of boring.  But you could easily relabel them if you like.  Also, I have &quot;Ambition&quot; instead of Bonds, because Bonds never really did much for us.  We just declared that Aid/Interfere is always rolled at +1 (because pretty much it was), and required everyone to declare a specific Ambition for their character.  Any session in which you do something (pretty much anything) that in some way advances you toward your Ambition, +1 xp in the End of Session move.<br /><br />Otherwise, my goal is for this to be reasonably balanced against the standard classes.  Comment welcome (and definitely let me know if you play it, how it goes).

        <p>I should credit a few moves borrowed from Johnstone Metzger&#39;s <i>Merchant</i> and <i>Captain</i> classes, and the regular <i>Bard</i> class, and probably one or two other places I&#39;ve forgotten now.</p>

        <p>&quot;Captain and Commander&quot; is great!  How does the coin cost for rewarding mercenaries sync up with the &quot;300 coin/month&quot;?  Is that additional, so the 300/month is also needed for thugs and retainers?</p>

        <p>Hm.  Good question.  I wanted there to be a maintenance cost to encourage regular use of <i>Entrepreneur</i>, and probably everybody needs to be paid at least some coin.  Do you think it works to leave the 300/mo as a simple coin payment, and leave the &quot;coin/status/debauchery&quot; rewards as RP color?<br /><br />My thinking is that the reward preference is a thing that will mostly come up on partial successes with <i>Caravan Master</i>, and occasionally as a bit of post-adventure color.  Rewarding with coin is usually going to be the least complicated thing in play, though sometimes you get a broke baron as an employer who&#39;s more keen to throw a parade than actually give anybody any money. And it&#39;s usually pretty straightforward to buy debauchery with money, though if you don&#39;t care how much damage you leave behind, it could be somebody else&#39;s money that pays for cleanup.</p>

        <p>If you don&#39;t mind me asking what program do you see to make these and do you have a template? </p>

I&#39;m sure InDesign would do much better, but I don&#39;t have that.</p>

        <p>Cool thanks, if InDesign works then so should Scribus. Which is a freeware verison of Indesign. You might like to try that. Thanks for the template.</p>

        <p>Good work!<br />Much better than the majority of paid PlayBooks available.</p>
