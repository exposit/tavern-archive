<b>Flying Carpet</b><br /><br />This is a magical flying carpet about the size of a good sized area rug one which one or two people could stand comfortably. Unfortunately since it is a carpet and made of cloth it provides no support when in flight. Attempts to fasten wooden support from below or rolling a person up inside it and sending them flying through the air like an arrow have been tried to limited success. Hardly the stuff of legends, many an adventurer has been disappointed by this &quot;treasure&quot; and is best used with caution.<br /><br /><b>When you go for a magic carpet ride...</b> describe how you try to ride on the unstable carpet and roll.<br /><br />On a 10+ whatever you did it worked...this time.<br />On a 7-9 Flying was easy,landing not so much.<br />On a 6 or less...<b>SPLAT!</b>

        <p>I had an alchemist sell the party a dodgy Flight potion (cheap!) a while ago. Â None of them have dared use it yet.</p>
