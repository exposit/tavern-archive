My group wants to start a campaign in a fantastic 30 years war Europe (early to mid 1600s). That&#39;s effectively generic fantasy tech plus primitive firearms and cannons. Any tried and true home brew rules to reflect reload time?﻿

        <p>My friends and I ran a Magical French-Indian War campaign. The red coats were sorcerous druids. I think what we did is make up custom moves for loading weapons. Something like, <b><i>when you take a minute to load your rifle in the heat of battle</i></b> roll + dex, on 10+ you do it and maintain cover. On 7-9 you do it but don&#39;t maintain cover. ﻿ But I think we also made it so that a rifle blast, on a hit, did d12 damage or something. Basically we treated the rifle like a magic item and make a set of custom moves for it. I don&#39;t recall this being a great solution though...</p>

        <p>DW rules don&#39;t usually cover timing in combat. Do you need a move for that or can you cover it in the fiction? Just give guns the <i>reload</i> tag as needed.</p>

        <p>Yes! Thanks for clarifying. I want to use a narratively satisfying firearm. </p>

        <p>I don&#39;t think you need a move for that any more than you need a move for weapons being <i>dangerous</i>. They&#39;re both descriptive tags that come without specific mechanics, but you do what makes sense. If you use a [dangerous weapon] without training, you might hurt yourself. If you fire a handgonne or something that needs reloading, you&#39;ll need some time to reload it before firing again.</p>

        <p>That&#39;s actually perfect.</p>

        <p>I agree with Mr. Tucker - The &quot;Dangerous&quot; and &quot;Reload&quot; tags give you, as GM, all you need to exploit the complications of these weapons.  Custom rules are cool, but unnecessary.  Maybe AP, or &#39;roll damage twice and apply the higher&#39;.<br /><br />&quot;You shoot him?  I thought you already fired your gun.  You reload?  You know he&#39;s RIGHT THERE, swinging at you, right?&quot;<br /><br />&quot;A miss?  And you&#39;re using a Dangerous, gunpowder filled weapon?  The powder on your tray must have gotten wet - only some of it goes off.  The rest spreads everywhere around you, including into your eyes.  Give me a Defy CON, we&#39;ll see if that blindness is temporary.&quot;</p>
