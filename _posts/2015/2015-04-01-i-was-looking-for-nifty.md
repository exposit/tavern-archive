I was looking for nifty ways to make a homemade GM screen on the cheap, and I think I may have found what I&#39;m gonna use. This looks pretty sweet, and should definitely cost under $10 (maybe around $7 or so? I&#39;m not sure how much everything costs).

Simple instructions on how to put your own GM/DM Screen together that can be used with any tabletop RPG system. All you need is 7 binder clips, 2 ringer bind...

        <p>Think this was the same video that prompted me to build one of these. Price seems about right, less if you buy at a discount department store or big box rather than a drugstore.<br /><br />I&#39;m not sure where my monstrosity has gotten to, but I just recently unearthed my [much more expensive but also more structurally sound and able to lie flat] The World&#39;s Greatest Screen. So I don&#39;t really have a ton of use for the homebrew.<br /><br />It held together well enough, the little bit of use that mine saw.<br /><br />I would say the thinner the binders, the better. If you can find them under 1/4&quot; I&#39;d go as low as you can. Not sure what to do to prevent the clips from popping off when jamming your screen in a bag, that was am issue I had. Otherwise no real issues beyond typical binder issue whinging.</p>

        <p>Hm, I could see that problem with the clips coming off, especially since, though I don&#39;t throw my backpack into fire or anything, I definitely toss it around, especially when getting into my van. I just kinda give a gentle toss to my passenger seat. Well, still, it won&#39;t be the end of the world, and we&#39;ll cross that bridge when we get to it.<br /><br />Yeah, i was thinking the 1/4&quot; binders for this, definitely. Anymore would just be unnecessary.Thanks for a bit of first hand feedback, <span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink" href="https://plus.google.com/111955425612262403025" oid="111955425612262403025">Nick Carter</a></span>Â !</p>
