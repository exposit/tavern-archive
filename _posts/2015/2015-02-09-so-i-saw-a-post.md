So I saw a post floating around earlier. It has a link to an article by Lawrence Schick about finding his and Moldvey&#39;s homebrew D&amp;D setting, the &quot;Known World&quot;. (This link) As I was reading it, I came across this line, <br />&quot;We dubbed this setting the “Known World,” to imply there was more out there yet to be discovered,...&quot;<br /><br />I just thought the connection between OD&amp;D and DW was fun, and figured I&#39;d share.
