First attempt at trying to make &quot;old-looking&quot; character sheets. Didn&#39;t go perfectly but hopefully my group likes what I did. I did the portraits on a tablet based on their descriptions. It&#39;s all on my deviant art page, feel free to use it for your characters/NPCs. <a href="http://sirsavage.deviantart.com" class="ot-anchor">sirsavage.deviantart.com</a>

        <p>Tea bag. Never heard of the coffee grinds method, I&#39;ll have to try that next time!</p>

I just made the paper with regular printer paper soaked in water with a tea bag and then put them in the printer and printed the characters onto them.</p>
