Apologies if this is the wrong place, but...<br /><br />After looking at Adventures on Dungeon Planet, I realized that I wanted to make my own version of a sci-fi mod to Dungeon World.<br /><br />My idea is to blend the idea of Away Teams from star trek, SG teams from Stargate, along with Firefly and Dr.Who adventures and blend them all together - Basically setting the game around the concept of appearing on planets and having adventures on them. A lot of it would be abstracted (The &quot;home base&quot;, as a concept, could be any of the bases from the above examples), and the overall goal would be to let the players help craft their universe when they sit down to play.<br /><br />I was wondering if anyone&#39;s done anything like this before, and if there are resources I can use to help. Also, I&#39;m happy to bounce ideas around if anyone has them.<br /><br />And again, if this is the wrong area, I apologize. I&#39;m new.<br /><br />Thanks!

        <p>My first gm round of dw was pretty much based off John Carpenter&#39;s Escape from New York except in &quot;Philadelphia maximum security prison&quot;. All i did was write a bunch of moves on index cards for guns, grenades, and bought a road map of philly and drew a wall around the city limits. Told the pcs that they needed to find the president of the united states and get him out in 22 hours or they all die. I used a real clock the i skipped ahead whenever they travelled or rolled a 6-. Every one had a blast and the players brought most of the imagination to the table so prepping the next session is going to be a snap. <br /><br />My point is, DW is so flexible, just go for it. Make up moves for items like lasers, teleporters, travelling in space and let the rest play out on the table. </p>

Seems that AW is better suited for that kind of games (you need less rolls, you don&#39;t need &quot;old style&quot; HPs etc.). So, maybe AW hack is the right answer. Maybe not.<br />Start with: <br />Beyond - alpha v1.71<br />Uncharted Worlds v0.83<br />Star Wars World - gamma Playbooks 2014</p>

        <p>I&#39;ve tried AW and honestly I didn&#39;t enjoy it as much. Wrapping the skill checks to style results in players really playing to their stereotypes. I like HP, and I like the classic attributes.<br /><br />That being said, I will check out the ones you mentioned. Thanks!</p>

        <p>It should be quite easy to adapt those hacks to DW style.</p>

        <p>My recommendation: if you&#39;re after a quick list of planets to set down on for SF adventures, the Traveller maps give thousands, with <br /><a href="http://www.travellermap.com" class="ot-anchor">http://www.travellermap.com</a> freely available, with a map generation tool. <br /><br />The UWP (universal world profile) lists starport, size, atmosphere, hydrographics, population, government, law level and technological level, each using a single digit code. <br /><br />A key to the codes is also available on the site. ﻿<br /><br />(Quick check of site, decides further explanation necessary)<br />Fastest way is to select a random location, click download icon at top right, then Printable Sector Booklet will give a map, list of worlds, and a map key all together.</p>

        <p>Actually I&#39;m anticipating planet generation to be the opening of each adventure. Set it up so that the players are creating the planet and why they&#39;ve arrived there.</p>

        <p>My draft game Beyond may cover what want you want, as it is written with planetary adventures in mind.  It&#39;s in draft, so any feedback you have will be very welcome.  Most recent version:<br /><a href="https://plus.google.com/106207499701502364297/posts/8FgVAJsYVHp" class="ot-anchor">https://plus.google.com/106207499701502364297/posts/8FgVAJsYVHp</a></p>
