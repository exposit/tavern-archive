        <p>Finally got a chance to run this. Our adventurers found themselves at the top of Baron Vorksor&#39;s ebony tower, and reclaimed the arcane prison of the ancient elemental Aldara, the white sky. Looking out the window, they saw only water (alarming, since they arrived by land, the tower must have moved!)<br />On their way out, they fought through several tentacular horrors. The barbarian had the Artificer fuse a stinger tentacle onto her broken sword hilt. They were ambushed by the corrupt sherif Morgan Rath and her gang of thugs, who killed the barbarian and took captive the artificer. The rest of the party (Immolator, fighter, bard) dispatched the rest of the gang. The dead barbarian&#39;s player then stepped in for the sherif, who weighed her odds and decided to surrender to the party and help them escape.<br />Once outside, they repaired a derelict galley, took to sea and released Aldara, who granted each a boon and then filled the sky with featureless white clouds. Then it started snowing. In August.<br />The Bard asked the elemental for knowledge of an ancient language with clues to the fighter&#39;s past (the fighter, Omen Dog, asked to play an corpse animated by a swarm of spiders. I said, &quot;sure, how does that work?&quot;) the bard then translated one of his old songs, which spoke of the spider queen and her three sons: rat, dog and hawk, who foretell the queen&#39;s return.<br />So it was fun for me at least. Lots of 6- results, but they got through it. And they gave me three really meaty fronts to work with: the white sky, baron vorksor and the spider queen.<br /></p>
