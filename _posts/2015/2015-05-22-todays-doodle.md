        <p>The more you post, the more I want those darn markers. :-D Another very cool piece sir.</p>

        <p>About that . . . Just got some bad news.<br />The Michaels near me just dropped them. It sounds like it&#39;s chain wide (at least up here in Canada). You can still get them but I think they come from the UK, so you are talking big bucks.<br />Michaels carries a similar product called Copic, but the cool grays look they only come in six shades vs. the ten that the Patones came in.<br />I don&#39;t have much a choice but to go with the copics, but at least it&#39;s 30% off the entire purchase starting tomorrow.</p>

        <p>I&#39;ve used Copic briefly before. I should look into them; I&#39;ve always liked them. And truth be told, I&#39;m super super super amateur, so it&#39;s not like I&#39;d use all 10 shades anyway &gt;.&gt;</p>

        <p>Checked out the Copic markers today. Nice blending but I didn&#39;t like the actual brush tip. Might end up going with Prismacolors instead. 36$ for six before discount. Not bad.</p>
