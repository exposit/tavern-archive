        <p>We are in the process of completing 2 supplements and should have them ready for download very soon. The first is called the Dead and the Damned. It sorta like a mini monster manual if you will that has all the good guys, bad guys and zombies in neat little stat blocks. It also features some custom bad guys like &quot;red necks&quot; and &quot;gangbangers&quot;. The second is called &quot;Bits and Pieces&quot; and it&#39;s really just a ZM cheat sheet. Both of these can be turned into booklets rather easy.<br />BTW, love to know how things are going so far . . .<br />Stay living!</p>

        <p>That&#39;s awesome! As you soon as you put up the pdf&#39;s I&#39;ll probably turn those into books as well though if &quot;Bits and Pieces&quot; is short enough I might just stuff them both into one book. Thank you for all the work on this!<br />I&#39;ll be sure to put up a session summary soon to share the (probably short) stories of my survivors!</p>

        <p>K, sorry for the dolt&#39;ish question - but where do I get this system and the supplements?</p>

        <p>How do you make a book of it? I&#39;ve been spiral binding my stuff for years!</p>
