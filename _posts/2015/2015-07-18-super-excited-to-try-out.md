Super excited to try out DW for the first time in a couple days. I have devoured the book and loads of online material, and I&#39;m finally ready to explore this pulpy world my group is going to create together! In preparation for the session, I just wanted to send the players the classes--no rules, just the narrative descriptions. The book is so wonderfully written, and strikes such a great tone.<br /><br />One problem I&#39;ve run into--I can&#39;t seem to find a description for the Barbarian class! Barbarians are such a staple of tabletop fantasy (with my groups usually), and I was excited to see the authors had made the class...but is there a description written by the authors?<br /><br />Thanks!

        <p>I don&#39;t think there&#39;s an official one, like in the main book. I&#39;d use this, though:<br /><br />“Hither you came, sullen-eyed, sword in hand, a thief, a reaver, a slayer, with gigantic melancholies and gigantic mirth, to tread the jeweled thrones of the dungeon world under your sandaled feet.” </p>

        <p>Love that Robert E. Howard-esque take. Thanks,  may just use that as a jumping off point!</p>

        <p>The authors did a Barbarian class as a kickstarter bonus.  It should be around somewhere.</p>

        <p>+colin, thank you. I actually knew about the class already, but I was talking specifically about the flavor text--wondering if the authors had one for Barbarian. In lieu of that, and taking inspiration from the Conan intro, I wrote my own</p>

        <p>Oh!  I see.  Yeah, I&#39;d definitely go with the line from &quot;The Phoenix on the Sword&quot;.</p>
