Hey guys, what do you think of my modified equipment list? I wanted to make the players&#39; choices meaningful while staying true to the DW idea of minimal roll modifiers. But I can&#39;t seem to help myself from adding a little D&amp;D 2.5 to anything and everything. Thanks for any input!!!<br /><br />Long Bow = near, far, +1 damage, training						100c/2w<br />Arbalest &amp; windlass = near, far, +1 damage, +1 piercing, reload			90c/4w<br />Stiff Dagger, Long Knife = hand, +1 piercing					3c/1w<br />Falchon, Pick, Morning Star = close, +1 piercing, messy				10c/2w<br />Dueling Rapier, Scimitar, Bastard Sword = close, +1 piercing, finesse		50c/2w<br />War Sword, Poleaxe = close, two handed, +1 damage, +1 piercing			20c/3w<br />Bardiche = close, two handed, forceful, +1 damage, +1 piercing, slow, messy	23c/4w<br />Lance, Pike = reach, near, two handed(or couched), forceful, +1 piercing		8c/3w<br />Flamberg = reach, two handed, forceful, +2damage, +1piercing, slow, messy	29c/5w<br /><br />Padded +1 slashing, piercing, and if plate(helmet) added: bludgeoning		6c/0w<br />Leather +1 bludgeoning, piercing, and if plate(helmet) added: slashing		8c/1w<br />Mail +1 armor										10c/1w<br />Plate Mail +2 slashing, piercing, +1 bludgeoning or +2 w/g. helm			25c/2w<br />Mail(or Leather w/ G.

        <p>I see the bonuses you add are to damage or piercing - in that case, it&#39;s quite all right: crunchier than I&#39;d have DW, but it shouldn&#39;t risk breaking the game, like having bonuses on actual moves would. <br /><br />On the other hand, I think that dividing in classes of damage for armor sounds quite unnecessarily convoluted here.</p>

        <p>Also, as a general comment, I am not sure whether, in a game of DW, player choices are actually choices about equipment.</p>

        <p>+1 damage is basically always better than +1 piercing that&#39;s why in the basic book things are either +1 dmg or +2 piercing.</p>

        <p>Only Kite and Tower shields can defend against arrows?</p>

        <p>A little hard to read in it&#39;s current format, but you know what? I like it, especially the shield section.</p>

        <p>What does &quot;defends against&quot; mean, in the shields section?<br /><br />I&#39;m not fond of splitting defenses up by damage type and range, that&#39;s too much fiddly bookkeeping for me and imo doesn&#39;t really add anything.</p>

        <p>Heavy armour and large shields should impose penalties on movement and endurance. Perhaps take -1 forward for Perilous Journey? <br /><br />Think of this as a memorial to the Crusader Knights that the Saracens lured out into the blazing hot desert and slaughtered...<br /><br />...bunch of deluded, inbred tossers.</p>

        <p>You could remove the &quot;hand&quot; defences for Kite and Tower. So you can simulate that enemies with very short weapons/blades could avoid the &quot;wall&quot; (maybe putting their weight on it, maybe fast-dodging) and entering the guard of the slower, heavier shielded enemy.</p>

Too much to keep track of for this kind of game.<br /><br />Same thing with the helmet mods.  You know what the benefit of wearing a helmet is in DW?  <i>You&#39;re wearing a helmet.</i> If you get smacked on the head, you can say &quot;I&#39;ve got my helmet on&quot; and the GM&#39;s got to take that into account. At the very least, you get your armor.<br /><br />I did add a <i>crude</i> tag to weapons, making them -1 damage against armored foes.  And the <i>crude</i> tag on armor or shields indicates that, fictionally, they&#39;re more likely to break/shatter/etc. <br /><br /><span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink" href="https://plus.google.com/111063200037086452489" oid="111063200037086452489">Michael Barry</a></span> I went with a <i>warm</i> tag for what you&#39;re describing.</p>

Because I wanted their to be a difference between larger and smaller shields, I felt the penalty was justified by the imagined difficulty of blocking speeding projectiles from afar with smaller shields. I also get people&#39;s comments about keeping rules light, but my group can&#39;t help but do a little PvP, and when we do that we always want the equipment chosen to be meaningful.</p>
