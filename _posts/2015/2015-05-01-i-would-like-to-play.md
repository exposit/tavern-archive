I would like to play the Dark Sun setting with my players.<br />They will probably be attacked by a Silk Worm with its poisoned bite.<br />If the players get hit by that creature are they automatically poisoned (in this case paralyzed) or do they get like a defy danger +con roll against it?

        <p>If a creature has a poisonous bite and successfully bites a PC, it sounds to me like they would be automatically poisoned. You could make a custom move or use Defy Danger to see how much damage they take or what effect the poison has. Or if the poison is virulent enough, they&#39;d just take damage.</p>

        <p>I&#39;d just write a monster move about paralyzing poison. Then, when a PC rolls a 6-, if plausible, I&#39;d paralyze them (describing how and why).</p>

        <p>When you a bit by a silk worm, roll +con. <br />On a 10+ you feel stiff as you shake off the little poison that made it into your system. Take -1 forward.<br />On a 7-9, the poison is slowing you down and affecting you greatly. Take the weak and shaky debilities. <br />On a miss, you a paralyzed and unable to move.</p>

        <p>Delos provided a great example of a move you could give the silk worm, that provides a bitten character a chance to shake off poison.<br /><br />It is important to keep clear though that this is a special move related to that monster, and NOT a Defy Danger.  Don&#39;t get Defy Danger confused with a D&amp;D style saving throw!<br /><br />You could also determine that anyone bit by the silk worm gets paralyzed for some length of time.  Before biting a player, i would soft-move the heck out of it, so that they are prepared - before they get near them, they hear others talking about the dangerous bite of a silk worm, and how it freezes its pray and makes for easy eating.  As they get near, they find the half eaten carcass of a major predator, clearly dangerous in its own right but unable to resist the poison well enough to stay off the menu.<br /><br />Finally, when they encounter the worm, maybe include a brief exchange where a bit of spittle gets on their arm and the flesh goes cold, then numb.<br /><br />Make sure they know it&#39;s a real danger.  That way they may come up with a way to resist it, and if they don&#39;t mitigate or avoid it you can nail em with paralysis.<br /><br />Being a fan of the character means throwing em in the deep end sometimes to see how the players get em out!</p>

        <p>I only recently saw a youtube video of missclicks, adam koebel doing dungeon world and he actually let the party roll defy danger +con against the medusa&#39;s gaze and defy danger +con vs some undeads creature spell or power. So there is a saving throw :)</p>

        <p>Sure. Though there&#39;s nothing that says you have to do that too. ;)<br /><br />Part of the beauty of DW (and other AW-based games) but part of the difficulty in providing advice, is that there are very very few rules that you <i>must</i> follow. Most of it is just guidelines.</p>
