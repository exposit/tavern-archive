How do you go about selling a playbook or front etc. Ican work out the last bit (selling on DTRPG for example) but not how the &#39;license&#39; works for DW. is it just including a logo and some specific text or do you need permission or similar?<br />And what do you do for art? How does creative commons art work...does that mean you cant sell the work?<br /><br />Thanks in advance for any replies.

        <p>It&#39;s best to go look at the licenses themselves to determine what you can and can&#39;t do, rather than asking for legal-ish advice on a forum. I am not a lawyer, and cannot give advice as such, but there are a variety of CC licenses that allow commercial uses without costs to the seller.</p>
