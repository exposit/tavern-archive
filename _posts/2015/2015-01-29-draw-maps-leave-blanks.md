        <p>Unfortunately not, but that space isn&#39;t great for recordings (it&#39;s a bar so there&#39;s a lot of noise from the front of the room).<br /><br />I plan on giving this presentation again at work in the near future. I&#39;ll make sure to setup a camera for that one.</p>

        <p>I would love to see this.  DW has really impacted the way I think about RPGs, but it&#39;s difficult to put into words.  I think this is the reason DW is magic; it systematizes a play style that strongly increases player collaboration/agency/buy-in. </p>

        <p>The presentation touched on some of the GM principles, and how we need to eschew traditionalist thinking of interactive narrative and embrace emergence.<br /><br />There was a bit of controversy because I&#39;m essentially going against what every respected (video)game developer says... And I called bullshit on the creator of Deus Ex.</p>
