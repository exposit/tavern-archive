How much extra work isÂ  needed to go from a Compendium Class to a Class Warfare specialty? Also related, where is the sweet spot for the amount of moves in a CC? Doesn&#39;t a Specialty need an amount of moves that could dilute a CC?

        <p>In my experience not much is needed. 2-3 extra moves, racial moves equipment. Totally doable and for me now much preferred.</p>

        <p>Basically, you need 2 or more advanced moves in the level 2-5 tier and the same in level 6-10 tier (and a lot of CCs have that many moves already); plus any modifications to damage, HP, load, etc; some race, bonds, and alignment options; and a piece of gear.<br /><br />If there&#39;s only a few moves, it becomes possible to build a character that doesn&#39;t have enough advanced moves to choose 1 per level. But that&#39;s really the only reason a specialty needs lots of moves. Otherwise, it just needs enough stuff to make somebody want to take it for their character.</p>
