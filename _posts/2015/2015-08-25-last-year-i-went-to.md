Last year I went to a small local board gaming convention in Michigan called DaveCon and ran a few one-shot adventures in DungeonWorld. I got a lot of positive response and I&#39;m planning on doing it again this year. Does anyone know if the DW folks have any branded merchandise or anything that they provide? I&#39;d like to pass some swag out to the players.

        <p>I would be interested in learning more about this as well. I have just submitted a request to run Dungeon World at U-Con in Ypsilanti in November. <br /><br />On a side note, what did you run as a demo? I used the Slave Pits of Dhrahzu as a demo recently.</p>

        <p>I brought a bunch of the adventure starters that people have wrote and let the players pick. I think we ended up doing the sky chain one, and the goblin hole.  <a href="http://dragonsinmyhouse.blogspot.com/2014/01/dungeon-world-adventure-starters.html" class="ot-anchor">http://dragonsinmyhouse.blogspot.com/2014/01/dungeon-world-adventure-starters.html</a></p>

        <p>There&#39;s no free swag budget, but you could buy some official shirts...<a href="http://www.zazzle.com/dungeon_world_crest_shirt-235155379030465093" class="ot-anchor">http://www.zazzle.com/dungeon_world_crest_shirt-235155379030465093</a></p>

        <p>Nathan, I am super curious to how that went. I have been really hesitant to try doing an improv style game using the starters in a convention setting. Did you write that up anywhere?</p>

        <p>I didn&#39;t write it up anywhere but it went really well. We had a pretty diverse group, a few redbox grognards, a few indie gamers, and a few total rpg newbies including an 8-year old with his dad. I think it went really well and everyone seemed to have a blast. Honestly I think the fact that I was obviously not using a prepared adventure and was just riffing off what the players were giving me upped their enjoyment a lot, because they knew they had a lot of freedom of action and weren&#39;t worried about &quot;messing up the plot.&quot;</p>

        <p>What your comments tells me is just embrace it and advertise it. Make it clear at the beginning that there is no set adventure, just a start. I know this is sorta the point of Dungeon World. I just had some hesitation doing it with strangers. Thanks for the positive story. I am gonna take a shot at using the starters for the con.</p>
