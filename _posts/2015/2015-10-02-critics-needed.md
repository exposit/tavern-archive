Critics needed! I wrote a custom move for an upcoming Funnel World game in which a mob of peasants encounter beastmen led by chaos priests who shoot bolts of mutating energy. I wanted to write a move that made it possible for a peasant to gain an interesting mutation or even become a monster. It would be fun turning a PC into a monster in the middle of a fight, and I don&#39;t really see a GM move that would allow for such a thing...<br /><br />Should the components of this move (gaining mutation, becoming a monster) be monster moves instead? Is it fun and fair to turn PCs into monsters because of one failed roll?<br /><br /><i>________________________________</i><br />When you are struck by the warping energies of chaos, roll+WIS.<br />10+ You are shaken, but maintain control of your body and mind.<br />7-9 Your mind is still your own, but your body warps - gain a random mutation.<br />6- Chaos consumes you! Gain two random mutations and become a beastman.

        <p>It&#39;s definitely fair for a funnel game - life is supposed to be cheap in a funnel. I think this is a little too hard for everyday use.</p>

Too complicated?</p>

        <p>I like it.  I&#39;d make it clearer on the 6- that you are now a monster and not a PC. Also, I don&#39;t think you need to say &quot;two random mutations&quot; if they&#39;re no longer going to be playing the character, except maybe for flavor.<br /><br />Maybe:<br />6-  Chaos consumes you! You become a beastman in control of the GM. Roll a couple random mutations to see just how weird you end up.</p>

        <p>Yep, fair and square: It´s a Funnel! Will hopefully teach them to run away from the chaos priests. As far as I remember &quot;strike fear into their hearts&quot; is one of the principals of Funnel World.</p>

        <p>Might be a little late but wanted to toss support behind The Metamorphica if you need some cool, random mutations. its a system-less book of dice tables for mutations and changes, I also believe its 100% free, but could be wrong.</p>

        <p>The move worked out great, thanks for the input! <span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink" href="https://plus.google.com/102595580176380683252" oid="102595580176380683252">Jeremy Strandberg</a></span>  I used your 6- result verbatim and it was a hit. Upon closer inspection, however, the Metamorphica was a little too real for the intended audience - the possibility of a being covered in anuses (a roll of 37 and 1) was extreme; I opted to make a table of 100 just-grosteque-enough mutations instead.</p>
