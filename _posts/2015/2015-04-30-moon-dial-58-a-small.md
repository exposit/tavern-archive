Moon Dial :<br /><br />A small charm on a leather strap, meant to be worn around the neck or tied to the wrist, the Moon Dial is a one-of-a-kind timekeeping and directional aid.  It appears to be a simple disk with a collapsing triangular point which can lay flat when not in use but swings up and into the center of the dial face when needed.  At night, with a clear view of the sky (or at least the moon itself), one who knows the time can easily discern direction, and one who knows which way is north can easily figure out what time it is.  It is very faintly magical.<br /><br />Do not expose it to a solar eclipse. <br /><br />SERIOUSLY, DON&#39;T DO IT.   You don&#39;t NEED to know why, it&#39;s safer if you don&#39;t, just avoid it at any cost.

        <p>That&#39;s... really awesome. I&#39;d be more than willing to use this in my own game.</p>
