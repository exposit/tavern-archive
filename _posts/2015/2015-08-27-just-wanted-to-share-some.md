Just wanted to share some of my custom moves for my campaign setting. I&#39;m adding 12 to each class since it seems like there just isn&#39;t enough. Would love to see more moves in Inglorious. Let me know what you think.<br /><br />Barbarian - They&#39;re not as survivable as a fighter or Paladin, but what they lack in durability they make up for in &quot;THAC0.&quot; They let their determination and single-mindedness guide them. Negatively or positively, they always tend to impress. And one doesn&#39;t survive in the wild without super-human senses. - magic buddy<br />RIP &amp; TEAR - take a third bard, fighter, or thief move. No multiclass moves.<br />EAGLE EYES - If you spend at least a minute scanning for something hidden in front of you or if  you don’t but there is a creature hiding in your presence, you see it.<br />OWL WINGS (requires Panther Patience) - When in an area that you can hide, and on a successful check, you can only be detected by sight from direct eye contact, sound by those that can hear your heartbeat, and scent by creatures that have tracked you or something you possess by scent before. This also confers a +1 bonus to checks made to sneak up on someone.<br />WOLF CUNNING - when waiting around to satiate one of your appetites, nothing can dissuade you, including pain, threats, fear, exhaustion, boredom, etc. If you successfully use this move to attain your appetite and are subjected to at least two such hardships, mark XP.<br />TIGER LEAP (requires On the Move) - you can leap twice as far as most other men of your stature and strength. In this way, you may catch foes who have not fought your kind before by surprise once at the start of a combat, despite them being fully aware of you. <br />PYTHON GRIP - when in pursuit of one of your appetites your effective strength for holding on to a thing or person is doubled. No single man, by hand or tool, may release your grip without destroying your hands/arms or wounding you. Two men roll without any aid bonus.<br />BEAR HUG - when wrestling you may deal your damage or a disability. If you can bite or roll your enemy into hard objects, your damage is messy as well.<br />VIPER STRIKE - when caught surprised or defenseless, but otherwise able to attack, and someone deals you damage while within your arms reach, deal yours back for free.<br />BERSERK - when in combat gain 6 hit points for its duration. At the end of the combat, or a moment after, take 6 damage and a debility. If this drops you below 1 hp and you survive your ordeal with death, mark XP.<br />RAGE - when in combat and in pursuit of one of your appetites, immediately subtract 2 hit points, but increase your damage die to a d12 for the rest of the encounter.<br />WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU? - your senses are so keen that you are highly susceptible to the super-natural. When near a source of divine or arcane magic you may choose to stop what you’re doing and enter a trance-like state, roll + WIS. On a success see a vision of the source’s origins, its current undertakings, or its future plans. On a partial success it takes notice of you. On a 12+ see two visions and mark XP.<br />TRUE SAVAGE - increase an attribute by 2 permanently.

        <p>How are the players going to get all of these moves? are you giving them more starting moves or more moves on a level?</p>

        <p>Just a bigger selection I think.</p>

        <p>One things to keep in mind is, characters usually retire around lvl 10 (cause they are hard to challenge at that point) so with that many moves most won&#39;t see players :( maybe gain 2 on the odd lvls? As long as all the classes can do it shouldn&#39;t be game breaking.</p>

        <p>Seems unnececary. Having hard choices to make is good. </p>

        <p>Oh oops! I didn&#39;t specify, but I do not offer my players any more than the standard 10 moves total for a level 10 character. I was strictly trying to add more possibilities to the classes, not the characters. Some of my players like high fantasy, some strictly 1980&#39;s TSR fantasy, and some Howardian sword &amp; sorcery, I try to accommodate them in regards to their characters specifically.</p>

        <p>PYTHON GRIP - when in pursuit of one of your appetites your effective strength for holding on to a thing or person is doubled. No single man, by hand or tool, may release your grip without destroying your hands/arms or wounding you. Two men roll without any aid bonus.<br /><br />Huh? What roll? Who rolls? The GM? That&#39;s not in DW rules at all!<br /><br />PYTHON GRIP - You can not forced to release anything you hold unless you choose to.<br /><br />Much clearer.<br /><br />TRUE SAVAGE - Are you suggesting attributes can be raised beyond +3? Also simple mechanical bonuses tend to be the least interesting in a fiction first game.</p>

        <p>I also feel Eagle Eyes and Viper strike could be combined into some &quot;Never Surprised/Danger Sense&quot; type move.</p>

Like if player characters get into a fight, which does happen. The DW rules allow for that just fine.<br /><br />I wasn&#39;t suggesting an attribute could be raised beyond 18. I should have specified.<br /><br />Good call about the combination of those two moves. Maybe I&#39;ll do that.</p>
