I&#39;m looking at a move I&#39;m creating for a paladin in one my campaigns who was brought back from a brush with death through his deity Malrack. This is my current, and most revised, format for the move. Please give me some feedback on it, as I want to make it a cool part of his character without blowing up the game too much. Thanks :)<br /><br />&#39;When you call on Malrack&#39;s power to aid you in one specific way, roll+CHA. On a 10+, he shows forth a mighty miracle through you to accomplish your desire. On a 7-9, the miracle also has negative consequences for you and your surroundings. On a miss, Malrack&#39;s wrath is kindled against you... remember, he is the God of Vengeance as well as Justice.&#39; <br /><br />I&#39;m going for the whole Risk vs Reward of many of the dungeon world moves, in which it can have great benefits but you&#39;ll think twice before using it all the time.

        <p>I think you&#39;ve got the risk vs reward thing down. Personally, I would make this a &quot;10+, choose X, 7-9, choose Y&quot; type move.<br /><br />Right now, the &quot;negative consequences for you and your surroundings&quot; is very broad. Which is totally fine, mind. I just find that having a number of options to choose from makes things easier for the GM; sometimes in the heat of the game you come up blank when trying to think of a consequence.<br /><br />Coming up with a list of consequences would also help define Malrack, making this move feel completely different from other similar moves.</p>

        <p>So more specific? And by a &quot;10+, choose X, 7-9, choose Y&quot; type move. do you mean two seperate lists for 10+ and 7-9 or two different numbers of things they can choose from the list, such as &#39;choose 3&#39; for 10+ and choose 1 for 7-9? <br />Also, would we want to list positive consequences as well as negative consequences?  (such as, choose 2 positiv eand 1 negative, or 1 positive).<br /><br />I understand I&#39;ll be the only GM to use this move, but there are always times I want those extra options. Thanks for the feedback, and hope you don&#39;t mind my barage of questions :P </p>

        <p>No problem. As I said before though, this is all just personal preference; what you have above is totally fine and works very well.<br /><br />You could do a mixed positive and negative list. I find that gets a bit messy though. So either a 10+ choose 2 and 7-9 choose 1 positive or a 10+ choose 1 and 7-9 choose 2 negative list might be better.<br /><br />Again, you don&#39;t <i>have</i> to go with the more specific list of options. You know what Malrack is like and so can choose appropriate results. But think of it this way; by making the positive and negative effects more specific, you&#39;re allowing other GMs to use the move by &quot;baking in&quot; what this Malrack deity is like. ;)</p>

        <p>Tell us more about Malrack.  He&#39;s about vengeance &amp; justice, yeah? What else? What symbolism does he use? (hammers, blades, blood, blindfolds, scales, etc?)<br /><br />What does he demand of his followers? What does he demand and expect of his chosen warrior (the Paladin)?</p>

On a miss, Malrack becomes displeased with your demands and places a terrible geas upon you. On a 7-9, his aid is begrudging, the geas is less severe but must still  be fulfilled. On a 10+, Malrack is generous this day, he shows forth a mighty miracle through which you accomplish your desire. Remember, Malrak is the God of Vengeance as well as Justice, ignore his geas at your own peril...</p>

        <p>Okay, I&#39;m on a trip so it&#39;s taken me a little while to respond what with spotty internet and everything. Thanks for the responses. <br />To start, we know Malrack is an Orcish diety of the south, and is associated with lightning and a great war axe. In fact, the paladin in question has been called to eradicate the more &quot;barbaric&quot; green skinned orcs of the spires(a mountain range). <br /><br />Now for incorporating  some of these these  themes into the move.<br /><br />I am liking the gaes idea posed by Ari and I may steal their wording for the move. <br />Jeremy did also pose good questions, so I am thinking Malrack would require consistant sacrifices, and upholding the honor and memory of ancestors. So more of a warriors pride and code, never letting a challenge go unanswered. <br /><br /><br /><br />&#39;When you call on Malrack&#39;s power to aid you in one specific way, roll+CHA. <br /><br /><br />On a 10+, he shows forth a mighty miracle through you to accomplish your desire. On a 7-9, the miracle also has negative consequences for you and your surroundings. On a miss, Malrack&#39;s wrath is kindled against you... remember, he is the God of Vengeance as well as Justice.&#39; <br /><br />I&#39;ll keep thinking about this, having noble requirements or requiring tribute would be an interesting facet of this. <br /></p>

        <p>Some thoughts:<br /><br />1) The move seems really, really vague and open-ended. I think that&#39;s what you&#39;re going for, right? Basically, dial-a-miracle?  But I think it might be better to try to narrow that down or least give it some guidance on the scope of what can be done.<br /><br />2) A couple moves to check out and consider as an alternate structure:  <br />  - <b>Elemental Mastery</b> (Druid): swap in your &quot;call on Malrack&#39;s power to aid you in one specific way&quot; trigger, but keep the choose 2/choose 1/uh-oh structure and the fact that you really want all 3 choices.<br />  - <b>Invoking the Gods of Law</b> (Class Warfare, p 440):  I&#39;d probably go with something like this.  Basically, it&#39;s roll +X, with choose 2/choose 1/displease the gods.  And the choices are:  gods display you publicly as their champion // gods point you towards the greatest source of chaos // gods show you a weakness of chaos in the region.  Swap those choices out for something more Malrackish and you&#39;ve got a solid &quot;champion&quot; move.<br /><br />3) If you want this to be a &quot;go big&quot; move, make it clear in the trigger than this calling down some serious mojo (e.g. &quot;When you call on Malrack to smite your enemies and scatter them before you...&quot;).  Then, maybe on a 10+ cool, he does it.  On a 7-9, he does it, but you can&#39;t use the move until you perform one of the tasks below.  On a miss, Malrack is displeased and smites you lightning for [b]2d10 damage (ignores armor) and you can&#39;t use this move until you atone by performing one of the tasks below.<br /> - Slaughter four score barbaric orcs<br /> - Erect a lasting monument to your ancestors<br /> - Sacrifice a potent magical artifact to Malrack, to be consumed in fire<br />  - Bathe Malrack&#39;s altar in the blood of your enemies<br />  - Defeat a <i>huge</i> and <i>terrifying</i> foe in single combat<br />Each time you recharge this move by performing one of the tasks above, cross off that task. You can&#39;t use it again.</p>

        <p>Great, great ideas. I did in fact get class warfare, also, I have been checking out some of your other work on DW  and I really like it. I will revise my move ay and send it back out  for more critique :-)</p>

        <p>As the paladin in question, I had an idea; the Wizard&#39;s Ritual is a great example of an open-ended move like this. perhaps the move could take some inspiration from that and be:<br /><br />When you call upon your deity (Malrack in this case) to perform a miracle, it will happen. However, the GM will give you one or more conditions from the list below to fulfill:<br />- The prayer/ritual will take hours/days<br />- The effect will not happen for hours/days<br />- The effect will be short-lived or incomplete<br />- Roll +CHA for success<br />- You will be winded/tired from the exertion<br />- You must take up another quest vow<br /><br />This way, it can have a variety of effects, but also have a fitting cost for what the effect is.</p>

You can add a lot of flavor with the choices, too.  Like:<br /> - Shatter a monument to a rival deity<br /> - Spill the blood of a worthy foe<br /> - Spill your own life-blood, unto the brink of death<br /> etc</p>

        <p>Yeah, let&#39;s make it more specific.<br />From the ideas given so far, I&#39;m looking for a combination of the ritual move and the &#39;go big&#39; style Jeremy was mentioning.<br /><br />When you use your divine authority to call upon Malrack for a miracle,tell your GM what you wish to accomplish and Malrack will answer you. However, the GM will tell you what he requires in return for the use of his power.<br />*Bring an enemy of Malrack to Justice Publicly and with Finality<br />*Build a shrine to your dead ancestors, and speak with them through the veil of death.<br />* Sacrifice a part of your soul or body to be consumed as a sacrifice.<br />In addition, you may replace any current vow in your quest with the vow of honor, but you must keep the vow of honor if you want to call on Malrack&#39;s power.<br />A miracle can consist of any of the following and more:<br />*Your immediate foes are struck down by Malrack&#39;s wrath.<br />*You heal any non-magical wound completely.<br />*You are lead straight to your greatest desire, as long as it does not conflict with that of Malrack&#39;s will.<br />*Malrack himself or one of his most trusted servants visits you.<br />*You are shielded from harm.<br />Finally, if you do not meet his expectations, his displeasure will come in one of these forms:<br />*Takes back his gift of life.<br />*Allows your enemies to take revenge on you.<br />* Bring you to justice.<br />*Electricute you.<br />*Endanger or harm you or your party.<br /><br />Thoughts?</p>
