The rules (moves etc) are there to support the fiction<br />2. The play is better when attention is on the fiction, switching to the rules only when that helps the fiction.<br />In practice, DW games often struggle to stay <i>in the fiction</i>, frequently dropping into rules based (&quot;I&#39;ll do this move&quot;) style of play.<br /><br />So, when do you use a move?<br />- When the fiction warrants it?<br />- Or when you recognize a move has occurred?<br /><br />Personally, I think the first option is more natural in play, provided you follow this underlying principle: The GM and the world respond to the players/characters&#39; actions (or inaction)<br /><br />Does that then mean moves really do only follow other moves?<br />- Technically, it does.<br /><br />Is it best to think of the game in these terms? <br />- When learning the game, I&#39;d say it probably does.<br />- But once you&#39;ve embodied the principle that the GM/world responds to the characters, then I think its better to follow the fiction rather than &#39;moves&#39;, as this keeps attention on the fiction and less on the rules.<br /><br />Why does this last point matter?<br />Because it&#39;s too easy for players to drop into &quot;I&#39;ll do this move&quot; style of play, and the GM staying above that sort of thinking helps the other players do so as well.

        <p>^That flowchart basically says that everything is stemming from and going back to GM moves.  Though as Johnstone points out in the discussion, there is also:<br />- Describing stuff <br />- Asking questions of the players<br />I&#39;d also add:  answering questions from the players (which is basically more &quot;describing stuff,&quot; but reactively).<br /><br />So that&#39;s <i>technically</i> how the game works: moves follow moves.  But as you point out, <span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink" href="https://plus.google.com/106207499701502364297" oid="106207499701502364297">Michael D</a></span>, as one becomes more experienced with this approach to GMing, you stop consciously using moves. You mostly just follow the fiction and the structure of the conversation that the game&#39;s systems have set up for us.  <br /><br />Here&#39;s another couple thoughts to noodle on:<br />1) <b>The distinctions between GM moves are anything but clear, as is the distinction between a hard and soft move</b>.  <br />2) <b>The principles are often in conflict with each other.</b><br /><br />Which, in practice, means that the GM moves and principles aren&#39;t nice, procedural boxes but more like vectors pointing you toward good play. </p>

For GMs its just that something happens: rocks fall and your dead (hard move) or you get a chance to react (soft move).<br />For players its applying the rules when something in the fiction tells you so. Hack and slash if you are in melee.<br /><br />So, defining these two things as moves is somewhat confusing, dunno why vincent did that? Or am i not getting it?</p>

        <p>Okay, I hope I don&#39;t mess this post up by rambling too much. <br /><br />First of all, I don&#39;t believe that thinking about GM moves and what you say as a GM only in GM move terms makes the game too mechanical. <br /><br />Making a GM move is just saying a thing. The easiest and most common &quot;type&quot; of move is &quot;What do you do&quot;. That is <b>putting them in a spot</b>, a very weak spot perhaps but a spot. Depending on what you said before it can be another move (like offering an opportunity) but in very broad terms:<br /><br /><b>When you tell the players what is happening, you are making a move</b><br /><br />That is a fact. Basically every time (unless you are clarifying something about the fiction or answering a mechanical question or the like) you say something it is a move. <br />Ideally it should be a move from the list because when you do those things you are bringing adventure in their lives and move the game forward. That is why you should not just look at a player B after player A did a thing and ask &quot;what do you do&quot; but hit them with a soft move to give them something to act upon and to engage with. <br /><br />Of course you shouldn&#39;t stop every time you want to say something, look at the move list, pick one and then say it. That is bad for the flow of conversation. Most of the things you will want to say will work out as long as you got the basic rhythm of the conversation down. <br /><br />Sometimes you don&#39;t know how to react though and then picking a specific move to do helps a lot. <br /><br />You said <br />&quot;Because it&#39;s too easy for players to drop into &quot;I&#39;ll do this move&quot; style of play, and the GM staying above that sort of thinking helps the other players do so as well.&quot; <br /><br />I don&#39;t really understand what you mean here. The GM is constantly misdirecting. It never feels mechanical when I say something. Maybe you can explain this again for me? <br /><br />I did however found cases where players roll a move not based on a GM or player move beforehand. <br /><br />GM: You are standing in a small cavern. The dim light from your torches reflects from a pool of what seem to be water or maybe some kind of gel in the middle of it. Ragdar, what do you do? <br />Player 1: I get close to the pool and poke it with my boot.<br />Player 2: Oh if you do approach that I will be right behind you, my shield raised to <b>defend</b> you from whatever is happening as a consequence. <br /><br />That is a move being triggered in response to a player saying a thing that does not trigger a move. That can actually happen. <br /><br />Without any GM moves however, the characters basically exist in a blank space without anything around them. The initial scene of everyone standing in front of a dungeon or being attacked by Harpies or whatever is a setup move. Without the GM saying things there is no basis for the characters to react or engage with anything. In addition, everything the GM says is basically a move (it might be a bad move but it still is one) and the move list and their names helps you to make good moves in accordance with your agenda and principles. </p>

        <p>Well the one thing that kind of breaks away trying to be all in fiction is Sprout Lore and Discern Realities...i don&#39;t think there is s way for the player to do those moves without machanically saying i want to discern realities here</p>

        <p>I remember back to fighter academy and the days we spend on learning tactics against goblins and other small critters. <br /><br />I look around the battlefield for a good tactical positions and possible traps.</p>
