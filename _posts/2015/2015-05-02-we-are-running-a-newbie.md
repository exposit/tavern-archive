We are running a newbie campaign tomorrow, Sunday 3 May at 9pm UK time, probably using Roll20. Keen to add one or two more people to the campaign, so if you are interested in joining a Brit or two and a couple Americans, get in touch!

        <p>I would be keen to join in,  and that is a great time for me.  I can find fun in any playbook,  and love DW with new folks.</p>

        <p>Great! Will update tomorrow beforehand with links etc. We have a cleric and a bard cum rogue so far. So whatever you like, just let me know so I have some prep.</p>

        <p>I will roll up The Druid, if that works for the group.  I can throw it together quickly once we start,  or get the basics set up ahead of time,  as you prefer.</p>
