So my campaign is over and my friend is about to gm a new one.<br /><br />I want to place a class with some utility outside of a fight but who can also bring some hurt if needed. I like the look of the thief  as I like characters that go up against crazy magic with nothing but themselves. <br /><br />We are allowed to use class warfare and I was thinking of building something using the blade dancer and the assassin but I can&#39;t pick a third component. Anyone got any ideas ? :)<br /><br />

        <p>I&#39;m sure you&#39;re aware of this already, but you can build the character with just 2 classes.<br /><br />Outside that, how about the mastermind? Their starting move is really good, and it would give you abilities to warn you ahead of time when you are facing that crazy magic</p>

        <p>Yeah I know about the taking 2 thing but I&#39;m not a huge fan. The mastermind would super well with my character idea as well now that I look at it</p>

        <p>I was just messing around with Class warfare and did a class combining Blade Dancer, Acrobat, and some moves from the Siren.  Very mobile combatant who can enchant observers.  Looks like it would be fun to play.</p>

        <p>I&#39;ve decided to go with a basic the if as its my first time playing. Having a blast with him. He&#39;s quickly became the party leader. I didn&#39;t wanna be but yeah. Problem is 3 of the 3 characters think he&#39;s a hardass cos he wasn&#39;t content to wait around for days in the inn drinking while people suffered. He&#39;s not really a thief. More of a government agent</p>
