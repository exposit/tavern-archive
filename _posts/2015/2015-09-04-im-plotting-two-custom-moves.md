I&#39;m plotting two custom moves for a phase of the session I&#39;m running tomorrow evening. I think they&#39;re in good shape, but I&#39;m curious what people think. The phase involves diving into the depths of an abyss in the shallow ocean floor, from whence issues toxic gas clouds and scalding steam (there is an underwater volcano at the base of the rift). I figure one or two tests for each player before we move to the next phase, depending on how the story goes.<br /><br />When you descend further into the choking depths of the abyss, roll +[CON or DEX]<br />- On a 10+, you avoid the immediate dangers.<br />- On a 7-9, pick one:<br />  - a scalding jet of steam sears you.<br />  - a billowing cloud of toxic gas disorients you.<br />- On a 6-, you are swept at the mercy of the current.<br /><br />When you provide guidance to another as they descend, roll +WIS.<br />- 10+ - Your guidance yields a +1 forward.<br />- 7-9 - You neither help nor hinder.<br />- 6- Your faulty guidance leads to disaster.

        <p>Why not just use Aid instead of the second move?</p>

        <p>Good call. The second one is unnecessary.</p>

        <p>On the first move, I&#39;d ask the players how THEY are going to pass the test and then roll + whatever stat you mutually feel is appropriate. Sort of like defy danger. But other than that, YAY! Custom moves!</p>

        <p>For the first one, it seems a little harsh. Both of the 7-9 choices seem like hard moves to me. Also, what do I actually accomplish? Like, do I get where I&#39;m going on a 7-9?</p>

        <p>Also, the first one seems pretty punishing. As a player, I&#39;d hate having to pick between those two, and as a GM I wouldn&#39;t feel like I&quot;m a fan of my players triggering that move.  What&#39;s your goal for having it?<br /><br />If you&#39;re aiming to make things more tense, I&#39;d simply make it a Defy Danger roll, and give yourself the flexibility to improvise a little (avalange, sudden gust of steam, underwater monster, etc). You can still apply those same effects, but you&#39;re not stuck with them.</p>

        <p>For the first move, I didn&#39;t properly note that it is a partial success - they do get where they were going, but they had some problem along the way.<br /><br />I can see what you&#39;re saying about it being too punishing. My goal is to make a sort of danger zone. This part of the ocean is unfriendly, and I wanted this phase to build up to what we&#39;ll call the &quot;boss&quot; at the bottom of the abyss. I guess I made the custom move because I thought it would help convey the particular flavor of this environment, rather than simply describe the thing and then do Defy Danger when they attempt to proceed downward.</p>

        <p>Ah! But the first move is effectively the same as Defy Danger, except you&#39;ve prescripted how they&#39;ll deal with it (dex or con) and prescripted the 7-9 as a specific hard choice. Nothing inherently wrong with that, but if your goal is to avoid &quot;simply describe the thing and then do Defy Danger&quot; you really haven&#39;t achieved it. <br /><br />Like Eric suggests, I&#39;d be more inclined to make a list possible dangers in the area and then present them as soft moves. Ask how the players respond and follow the snowball from there. <br /><br />Beyond that, here are two mechanics you can try:<br /><br />If the idea is that this a choking, toxic area even if you can breathe water, you want a &quot;hold breath&quot; move. My go-to is: When you <b><i>take a deep breath and plunge beneath the waves</i></b>, hold CON. Each time you roll for a move, spend 1 hold. If you are out of hold, mark a debility instead. If all your debilities are marked, take your Final Breath now. <br /><br />If the idea that this is an extended, difficult to traverse area that they need to get through, try a progress mechanic. Something like: When you <b><i>press on through the volcanic plumes and seek the far side</i></b>, roll +CON. On a 7+ gain 1 progress. On a 10+ choose 1. On a 7-9, choose 1 and the GM chooses another:<br />- you are scalded by steaming jets for 1d6 damage (ignores armor)<br />- you are blinded by volcanic ash and mud<br />- the foul water gets in your gills, making you cough &amp; sputter; spend 1 extra hold (from hold breath)<br />- you attract the attention of the dreaded ash eel (or whatever)<br /><br />When you accumulate 3 progress, you make it through the plumes.</p>

        <p>I think the progress idea expresses more of what I was going for - it&#39;s dangerous but the goal is to get through before something really bad happens.<br /><br />The hold breath doesn&#39;t appear to start with some amount of hold. Was that intended?</p>

        <p>It says &quot;hold CON&quot;.</p>

        <p>Well, clearly my reading skills have issues. I read that as &quot;roll +CON&quot; I guess? My bad.</p>
