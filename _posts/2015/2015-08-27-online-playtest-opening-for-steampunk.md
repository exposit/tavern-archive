<b>Online playtest opening for Steampunk World</b><br /><br />I&#39;m starting up an online playtest group for Steampunk World.<br />Time: Tuesday evenings (Central time); alt Monday evenings<br /><br />If you&#39;d like to join us, let me know here or privately.  <br /><br />FYI, rather than &quot;first come/first served&#39;, I&#39;ll be giving preference to people who, in addition to enjoying some Steampunk gaming, want to help make Steampunk World a success (in any way, let me know how).﻿<br /><br />NB: Steampunk World is based on, but different to, Dungeon World.<br />For the latest Steampunk World moves and playbooks see the post at the top of the Steampunk World community:<br /><a href="https://plus.google.com/u/0/communities/108439627279414945168" class="ot-anchor">https://plus.google.com/u/0/communities/108439627279414945168</a><br /><br /> <a rel="nofollow" class="ot-hashtag" href="https://plus.google.com/s/%23SteampunkWorld/posts">#SteampunkWorld</a>
