I remember when I was like in middle school or something and when I used a tweaked version of the Toon rules to play D&amp;D-like adventures with my siblings and cousins. I always loved just plopping them in a dungeon and being surprised with the creative stuff they&#39;d come up with.Â  Those experiences, to me, defined seeing players do awesome things as the main appeal of being a GM.<br /><br />I think Dungeon World appeals to me because it goes a step further by guaranteeing the players a say in the setting itself. This is actually pretty nice because the expectation to make a fully fleshed out setting kind of intimidated me from running games like dungeons and dragons, especially considering we&#39;d usually be playing for one or two sessions. Letting players define the world around them takes the pressure of me and lets them feel more involved.
