So. Druids and world talker. Does this mean I can become elementals?

        <p>Well at this point the game hasn&#39;t started I&#39;m sure the gm ( best friend) would let me justify it as a spirit of nature using its surroundings to take physical form</p>

        <p>Indeed it does. Because whenever you shapeshift the GM gives you moves for what you decide to shapeshift into, so it can be as strong as the GM let&#39;s you.  That&#39;s the main attraction of the base Druid is it&#39;s ability to turn into supernatural  energy, objects and animals.</p>
