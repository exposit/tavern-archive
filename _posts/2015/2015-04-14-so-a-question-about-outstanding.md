SO, a question about <b>Outstanding Warrants.</b><br /><br />RAW:<br /><br /><b><i>Outstanding Warrants</i></b><br /><br /><i>When you return to a civilized place in which you’ve caused trouble before, roll+Cha. ✴On a 10+, word has spread of your deeds and everyone recognizes you. ✴On a 7–9, as above, and the GM chooses a complication:</i> <br /><br /><i>o  The local constabulary has a warrant out for your arrest.</i> <br /><i>o  Someone has put a price on your head.</i> <br /><i>o  Someone important to you has been put in a bad spot as a result of your actions.</i> <br /><br />What happens on a miss? DM chooses one or more of those options?

        <p>On a miss the GM just makes a GM move as usual.</p>

        <p>I would treat the options under 7-9 as set-up or soft gm moves. In other words, the PCs learn or discover that a warrant is out for them, but they have time to decide what to do about it.<br />On a 6-, its more of a hard move. So, not only is there a warrant, but the Constable and his men actually arrest the PCs. (Or at the very least, suddenly show up and surround the PCs with the intent to apprehend!)<br />In one case the threat is less immediate and it gives the players a chance to decide what to do. In the other, the threat is immediate, and the players choices of how to react are probably more limited.</p>

        <p>Yep, this is just like most moves that don&#39;t list penalties for failure: GM has total discretion to make whatever move seems appropriate.</p>

        <p>DRAGON ATTACK! <br />On a miss there is a dragon attack! <br /><br />Yes, ok, with a miss the GM makes an hard move. <br /><br />I don&#39;t see why it should be anything but a dragon attack u.u</p>

        <p>Hard move, following thru&#39; the fiction, as usual.<br />No reason to make a hard move NOT related to the situation.<br />Also, NOT a dragon attack.<br />Because no, Ezio.<br />A zombie dragon, however...</p>

        <p>Perhaps the Outstanding Warrant might give rise to a Front, as the miscreant&#39;s infamy spreads to powerful individuals with an interest in peace and order?</p>

        <p>On a miss: The town&#39;s  have become man-eating people and they raise their forks at you. (Then during the battle: DRAGON ATTACK!!!) XD</p>

        <p>Make a hard move if a soft move has set one up.  Otherwise make a soft move.<br /><br />I like the idea of turning things around on a 6-.  So maybe everyone knows what the PCs did, and they&#39;re actually looked up to because of it!  The town actually gives them authority because of it!  Their arrival is praised in the streets!<br /><br />Because SOMEONE has to lead/save us from the two thousand strong Orc Horde headed this way!</p>

        <p>My personal favourite when there are lists is that a miss means EVERYTHING BAD HAPPENS.</p>

        <p>On a miss the town is in festive mood: a fair has been set up in the square, the center piece of which is a large, but as yet unlit, bonfire; adults lines the street to the square bearing swords, spears and pitchforks decorated with ribbons, every fourth person carrying a lit torch; and the town guard have turned out in force to give you a ceremonial escort to the celebrations.</p>
