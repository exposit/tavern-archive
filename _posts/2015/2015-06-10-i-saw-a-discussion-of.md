I saw a discussion of this once upon a time, and now I can&#39;t find it again. Maybe it was on Reddit?<br /><br />The Barbarian die rolling thing seems a bit awkward to me, particularly in online play. I saw a proposal somewhere to change the Barbarian back to 2d6+stat, with a +1 ongoing whenever following a passion. Whenever the player rolls doubles, the Barbs passions overwhelm him.<br /><br />Anybody remember where this is from? Anybody ever tried it? The difference between the two rolling techniques is less than 5% - any other drawbacks to this change? Something I&#39;m missing?

        <p>I&#39;m not sure what problem you are trying to solve here. What is awkward about &quot;is one die higher than the other&quot;?</p>

        <p>Nah, I prefer the modded 2d6 method as well. Do what thou wilt man.</p>

        <p>you lose a bunch of interesting play by removing the if the 6 rolls higher than the 8, for very small saving of typing effort</p>

        <p>I guess my objections are this -<br /><br />1) on Roll20 in particular, it takes a moment to determine which die is which, it interrupts my flow of thought jumping back and looking for the die silhouettes. A match would be much easier to spot.<br /><br />2) Aesthetically, it doesn&#39;t feel right. Almost every other move is based around the 2d6+stat, this one feels awkward. I don&#39;t see anything gained by making the change; there doesn&#39;t seem to be anything interesting mechanically that is hooked into the odd dice.</p>

        <p>Makes sense if you&#39;re playing in Roll20, I think, since as you say, it&#39;s much harder to tell the dice apart.</p>

        <p>Roll20 specifically gives an icon for each die it rolls. I&#39;d have though that would be easier than some of the ones that just give you the numbers</p>
