<b>Shut your mouth when you&#39;re talking to me!</b><br /><br />When you listen to the lunatic&#39;s/drunk&#39;s/possessed child/dying man&#39;s ravings, roll +INT. On a 10+ You can figure out the clues in the madness! Pick two, on a 7-9 pick one:<br /><br />-You learn where something is<br />-You learn what something is<br />-You realize something was right under your nose<br />-You have a suspicion confirmed<br /><br /><br />Move I am working on, thoughts?

        <p>The only thing is that it seems the player doesn&#39;t initiate it. Would this happen if they hear someone mumble something and they have to try and listen actively? Seems there should also be some kind of penalty on the 7-9 rather than just less benefit - to make it more entertaining.<br /><br />and.. pink one... hehehe.</p>

        <p>Like most investigation moves, the interesting part isn&#39;t finding out where something is, or what something is. You need that to progress the plot, that&#39;s the baseline. You should be rolling to find out the complications!<br /><br />Just spitballing:<br /><br />When you listen to the lunatic&#39;s/drunk&#39;s/possessed child/dying man&#39;s ravings, you are able to pick out vital clues from the ravings, but at what cost? Roll + INT, on a 10+ pick 2, on a 7-9 pick one:<br /><br />-You get an concrete, actionable clue that gives you +1 forward when acting on it.<br />-You hear something that allows you to make an unexpected connection! Ask a question, even tangentially related, and the GM will do their best to answer truthfully.<br />-You don&#39;t receive foreboding information that makes you question something known, like the loyalties of an ally, the nature of your investigation, or the nature of the world itself.<br />-Your psyche isn&#39;t caressed by the unknowable madness.<br /><br />Not crazy about the tangential question one, but I&#39;m trying to represent the twisty-turny nature of an eldritch/paranormal investigation.<br /><br />EDIT: If it wasn&#39;t clear, just give your players the &quot;learn something/confirm suspicion&quot; results because they <i>need</i> to learn that stuff anyway. Roll for crazier things. :)</p>

Is there a specific reason you wanted to create this?</p>

To push it further away from Discern Realities, and in deference to the forebodingish tone of the trigger, you should add some negative side. </p>

        <p>It&#39;s not bad, but it mainly seems like a very situational stat swap to make Spout Lore a little more like Discern Realities, and you should think about what&#39;s covered by this that&#39;s not in either Spout Lore or Discern Realities.<br /><br />If they try to SL in response to hearing something weird, you give them something interesting and useful. If they try to DR, they get questions, and there&#39;s a lot of overlap between the DR questions and the options here.<br /><br />So the main difference between this and SL is that this has more of DR&#39;s player-directedness of the information.<br /><br />But you should think about whether that fits the fiction. Is parsing a lunatic&#39;s ravings a place where intelligence gives you <b>more</b> control than usual over the type of information you gain?<br /><br />In that situation, I would probably just use either DR or SL depending on the description of what they were trying to do.</p>

        <p>Am looking for a starter for a adventure front where the players hear a dying man&#39;s last words that have clues to a treasure (or something). Would probably be best just to ask the questions at the adventure start than get fancy with a move.</p>

        <p>When you <b>attempt to question the drunk about a specific target</b>...<br />... by bullying him, roll STR.<br />... by twisting his words, roll+CHA.<br />... by getting drunk with him, roll+CON.<br /><br />On a 10+, you manage to find out some specific information that will get you closer to your target. On a 7-9, someone also confronts you or gets the jump on you while you are hassling the drunk.</p>

Parley&#39;s &quot;leverage&quot; is a very open concept for a reason.</p>

What I meant was that it seems like what you&#39;re suggesting is already covered by Parley&#39;s rather ambiguous notion of leverage which, I feel, works well. Your idea could certainly work for a unique move for a specific case, like harassing the drunk, but should have more specific effects.</p>

        <p>If it&#39;s an adventure starter, I might lean more toward just asking players questions.  Fighter, the dying drunk mentions a treasure you&#39;ve always dreamed of.  What is it?  Wizard, he&#39;s connected it to an unexpected name from your past.  Who was it?  Thief, you&#39;ve seen this drunk before.  When was that?<br /><br />Adding dice-rolling here seems like it would mostly give players a chance to roll badly and be denied the chance to contribute their share.</p>

        <p>Maybe make it work more like spout lore?<br /><br />Unravel the Conspiracy<br /><br />When the player perceives order in randomness, on a 10+ they come to a startling realization. 7-9 they see the patterns but can&#39;t follow them to their conclusion. -6 The madness stares back and the GM picks one.<br /><br />-incoherent rambling<br />-paralyzingly terror<br />-zealous fervor</p>

        <p>When you try to interpret or remember the ravings of the drunk, roll +Wis. On a 10+ pick 2.  On a 7-9 pick 1.<br /><br />-you recognize a reference to a famous treasure.  What is it?<br />-you find advice for dealing with a threat.  What is it?  Take +1 forward when following it<br />-you are not angered and confused by his rambling, and don&#39;t take -1 forward<br /><br />On a failure, DM makes a hard move</p>
