Adapted from Dragon Magazine Annual 1998<br /><br />Piranha Ant Swarm	<br />Horde, Tiny, Stealthy, Organized<br />Serrated Mandible (b[2d4-2] damage)	3 HP per 1000	0 armor<br />Hand, Messy<br />Special Qualities: Vulnerability to fire, Ignores Armor, Swarm Tactics<br /><br />About the size of a toddlers thumb the Piranha Ant is often disregarded as a harmless insect. Piranha Ants are not dangerous individually but are deadly as a swarm of thousands that are fearless and can strip a victim to its bones in a few minutes. <br /><br />With a head larger than most other ants, the Piranha Ants most deadly feature is its serrated mandibles that can tear flesh in chunks. Its body is similar in color to stone and dirt allowing the Piranha Ant to seamlessly blend with its surroundings. The Piranha Ant can communicate with others in its colony. A colony is mobile and can most often be found in large buildings and abandoned structures.<br /><br />There are several types of Piranha Ants. The most common and most deadly are Workers, these are infertile females who&#39;s purpose is to provide for the colony. After an attack the Piranha Ants will eat their own dead leaving only the victims skeleton behind<br /><br />The Scouts have wings and scour a steading for a likely victim, most often a human living alone. When a victim is found the Scouts Summon the Swarm [Roll 1d20*1000 to determine the size of the swarm] <br /><br />The Queen is in charge of laying eggs and growing the colony. She will not be found away from the colony.<br /><br />Instinct: Swarm and Consume them<br /><br />Leave nothing but bones<br />Attack when they are least suspecting<br />Summon the Swarm<br /><a href="http://codex.dungeon-world.com/monster/5734600403845120" class="ot-anchor">http://codex.dungeon-world.com/monster/5734600403845120</a>

        <p>It&#39;s 5:46 AM in Cali and I first read this as &quot;pinata ant swarm&quot; -- oh man! Ideas popping in my head over that. Adventurers whacking something (giant egg? hornet-like hive?) and carnivorous ants spilling out.</p>
