Hello all!<br />I&#39;m looking for advice on how to create a balanced and interesting class in DW. I have done some cursory research and haven&#39;t found a video or a post about it. I&#39;m also aware that ultimately in order to find out if a class is both balanced and fun you have to play test the bananas out of it, but I&#39;m looking for something that provides a good place to start.<br />Thanks,<br />Optimus_Penguin

        <p>Have you tried the book <i>Class Warfare</i>? I haven&#39;t read it, but I believe that might be what you are looking for...</p>

However, I was hoping to find something that was either free or cheaper than the base system.</p>

        <p>Start with a fictional theme. What does your class do that existing classes don&#39;t, or that the existing classes are a poor fit? Now, why and how do they do it?</p>

        <p>Interestingly enough, I think the game is hard to break if you stick to the basic move structure. I take the stance as DM, if I am dubious about a move, that I will just wait and make any failures equal and opposite in force to the move. In other words, if your move allows you to do something really powerful, I assume it gives me the right to make failure catastrophic in equal measure. Where I think playbooks get broken is when their creators create new rules or too casually award +1&#39;s for things (like racial abilities, or weapons, or increase or stack bonuses).</p>

        <p>Well, and awarding too many moves or moves that seem to destroy the notion of specializing. For instance, I could make a Dungeoneer playbook that has the trap moves of a thief, the basic useful spells of a wizard, the weapon stuff of a fighter, and the healing power of a cleric. (Even then, the book might not be broken. But it seems counter to the idea of the game.)</p>

        <p>Don&#39;t <i>completely</i> dismiss notions of balance. Folks often use the word to allude to &quot;things that are too powerful.&quot; You&#39;ll mostly avoid that if you if follow <span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink" href="https://plus.google.com/109840962456887986459" oid="109840962456887986459">Andrew Fish</a></span>&#39;s advice, but there are other types of balance to consider. You don&#39;t want to make moves that players never take, or that they take and never use, or (worst) that they regret taking.<br /><br />Ask yourself the following about any given move:<br /><br /><b>How is this better/different than a basic move?</b> If the trigger and range of outcomes are not noticeably different than Defy Danger... ask yourself whether it should really be a move I have to &quot;buy&quot; when I level up. Or, think about how you can make the move better/more interesting/different than a straight Defy Danger, but only in specific (thematically appropriate) circumstances.<br /><br /><b>If this where your character, would YOU ever choose that move? Would you USE it?</b>  It&#39;s really easy to accidentally make &quot;filler&quot; moves, ones that seem thematically appropriate but that wouldn&#39;t actually be that useful. Maybe you had an idea for a slick name or mechanic, but the fictional situation it would apply to is so limited that it&#39;ll never come up.  <br /><br /><b>If it&#39;s similar to other moves, is it objectively better or worse? Should it be?</b>  For example, there&#39;s a move in Class Warfare for the Sage that&#39;s something like &quot;when a PC comes to you for advice and you give it, they get +1 to act on the answer; at the end of the session, if anyone acted on your advice, mark XP.&quot;  Which is almost identical to the Wizard&#39;s <b>Know It All</b> move. The only difference is that Know It All gives you XP each time someone first acts on your advice; Sage Advice is only 1/session.  Why the difference?  I don&#39;t know, but if I was the Sage and I saw the Wizard&#39;s move, I&#39;d feel like I got ripped off.<br /><br />There&#39;s a lot more to it, but those are three &quot;checks&quot; I find myself doing with my own playbooks.</p>

I don&#39;t think of that as &quot;balance,&quot; but that&#39;s just semantics anyway. Your points are excellent. I think with DW it&#39;s always important to look for existing stuff you can re-use before you create something new, unless it&#39;s something like a custom move for a monster or location that is ephemeral. </p>

        <p>Echo what others have said, but also to add: there is a <i>mathematical</i> &quot;balance&quot; to DW, and it can be broken. For example, if—after adding your stat and bonuses and stuff—you add, say, +2 to your roll, works great; however, if you are adding +10, you are way off the deep end, never failing and sucking the fun out of the game. Generally, if players are adding more than +3 <i>a lot</i> in your game, something is probably wrong. This is why nearly anything in a move is better than &quot;take +1&quot; stuff.</p>

Mostly what you said, but also a +4 makes your odds of failing a roll extremely low, and anything beyond +4 it becomes impossible to fail a roll.  </p>

Crafting a good move is akin to writing a poem. You have to keep revising and refining the words, especially in choices with lists (hold X), to make them brief, clear, and evocative. </p>
