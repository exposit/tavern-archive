Been way too long since I did any serious work on  <a rel="nofollow" class="ot-hashtag" href="https://plus.google.com/s/%23Stonetop/posts">#Stonetop</a> , but I&#39;m hoping to get things rolling again. Here&#39;s a revision of <b>the Ranger</b>. Feedback welcome and appreciated.<br /><br />I had originally made my own world-specific expedition moves, but the ones in <span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink" href="https://plus.google.com/115657313205562994919" oid="115657313205562994919">Jason Lutes</a></span>&#39;s <i>The Perilous Wilds</i> are so good, I scrapped mine and used his instead. Plus, I&#39;d already done some work revising the core DW ranger to use those moves and the follower moves (it&#39;s on the Lampblack &amp; Brimstone community if you&#39;re interested).<br /><br />The other big revision is the way bonds are formatted and presented. I&#39;ve always wanted the bonds to tie more directly into the Stonetop community and establish NPCs. I don&#39;t know why I didn&#39;t think of simply having them involve <i>family</i> before now. Sometimes I&#39;m kinda slow.<br /><br />Anyhow, I&#39;ll be going back to do a pass at updating the bonds and moves for each of the playbooks in the next few weeks. Then, one last playbook to write (the Seeker, or bard/wizard analog).<br /><br />Shortly thereafter, I&#39;ll be looking for playtesters.

        <p>Took me a while to get to this and not much to suggest - the Ranger is looking very polished.<br /><br /><b>Opening description</b><br /><del>And</del> <i>You feel</i> the wide world a-changing.<br /><br /><b>Wide Wanderer</b><br />When you return to <i>an important</i> place...<br /><br /><b>Starting Gear</b><br />Removing the &#39;steel-&#39; adjectives may make this usable across a wider range of time periods.<br />(I don&#39;t recall what you&#39;ve done on other playbooks.  However, I&#39;ve been thinking Stonetop might be great for a stone-age game.)<br /><br /><b>A Safe Place</b><br />...whomever <i>rolls</i> for Make Camp takes +1.<br /><br /><b>Blot out the Sun</b><br />The second option seems a bit too undefined.<br />Perhaps:<br /><i>Attack all targets within 5(?) feet of your aiming point...</i><br /><br /><b>Called shot</b><br />Alt:<br />When strike at a target that isn’t defending itself, name your aiming point and roll +DEX.  <br />On a 10+ you hit exactly, the GM will tell you the effect.  On a 7-9 you deal your damage but cause unwanted harm or expose yourself or your allies to danger (GM’s choice).<br /><br /><b>Camouflage</b><br />Imho, the Ranger should get a benefit moving unseen through foliage or rough terrain as well.<br /><br /><b>On the Hoof</b><br />I&#39;d expect the Ranger to do some hunting as they travel, with the 1d4 ration output covering the limitation on that hunting.<br /><br /><b>Alpha</b><br />The last two 7-9 options occur as benefits, while the first may often be a cost, especially as the GM chooses not the player.<br />Alt:<br />On a 10+ it accepts your dominance or stays clear of you. On a 7-9 it fights you for dominance or slinks away for now<br /><br /><b>Animal Companion</b><br />= Benefits:<br />  - Rename &#39;meek&#39; to &#39;obedient&#39;<br />  - Poison for the viper (and perhaps some of the other small companions)<br />= The Instincts are all a type of cost, which makes the Cost section that follows feel like poor design.  I know Cost (upper-case &#39;C&#39;) has a specific meaning in Stonetop, but in this instance the ambiguity of the term is distracting.  Could be resolved by putting Instinct into the Costs section<br />= Ideas for Costs:<br />  - Attention<br />  - Hunt<br />  - Food</p>
