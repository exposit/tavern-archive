Free Rules!<br />Hey everyone. I have posted this in the PbtA community, but it might be of more specific interest here. I am working on a DW hack that I am tentatively calling &quot;Offworld.&quot; It&#39;s for &quot;Misfits in Space&quot; style adventures, like that TV show you love.<br /><br />I started writing it because I wanted DW in space, but Dungeon Planet, while awesome in its own right, lives in a pretty different genre than what I was going for.<br /><br />Anyway, here is a PDF of the very early super unrefined alpha rules of what I am currently calling &quot;Offworld.&quot;<br /><br />
