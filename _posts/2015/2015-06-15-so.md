        <p>My dream signature weapon is sharp, blood-stained fists with hooks and spikes and serrated edges. Bonus points for using the Blacksmith move to give it the properties of a Vorpal Sword. :P</p>

        <p>I&#39;m playing about with the idea of a Big Chain. &quot;Versatile&quot; so it can be reach when being swung about or close when its wrapped around my guys fists or arms.  Either &quot;huge&quot; or piercing</p>

        <p>My halfling&#39;s one was a short spear with a werewolf tooth as point. Decorated with crow feathers.<br />Tags: versatile (near, medium), decorated, piercing.</p>
