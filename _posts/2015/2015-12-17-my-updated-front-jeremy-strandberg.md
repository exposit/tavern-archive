        <p>Wait, you&#39;re making this before your first session?  Have the players already bought into this world and theme?  If not, I&#39;d be prepared to throw the whole thing out.  <br /><br />First sessions are all about starting the PCs in the middle of a poorly-defined but interesting, dangerous situation. You figure out who they are, what kind of world this is, why they&#39;re together, what they care about. And <i>then</i> you make some fronts, between the first or second session and the next ones.<br /><br />It&#39;s not unheard of to make some campaign-level fronts like this, as long as everyone&#39;s on-board with the assumptions you&#39;re making. But I wouldn&#39;t do any adventure fronts at this point!<br /><br />Instead, assuming that the players are down with this kind of grimdark setting, prep some stuff you need to get the players invested in the game.  For me, that usually includes:<br /><br />- <b>Questions</b> about why the players are <i>here</i>, where <i>here</i> is, what they&#39;re hoping to find or achieve, who they&#39;re worried about, who sent them, etc.  <br /><br />- <b>More questions</b> that tie them to this world.  Feel free to make these leading questions.  Like &quot;Who among is from Durnchapel? When were you last here?  Who still lives here that&#39;s important to you?&quot;  But also &quot;Do you believe the stories that Savanar Blackwing is really a bloodsucking creature of the night?  Why or why not?&quot;<br /><br />- <b>Even more questions</b> about the world they live. &quot;Ranger, what have you heard about lycanthrope and how the affliction is spread?&quot;  &quot;Wizard, what have your studies revealed about the last Demon Plague? When did it happen?  Who stopped it?&quot;<br /><br />- Come up with a <b>list of names</b> of possible NPCs, places, etc. that get the feel of the setting.  <br /><br />- Personal taste:  <b>find a more-or-less blank map</b> that you&#39;d like to set the first session in. Check out Dyson Logos&#39;s or Tony Dowler&#39;s blogs, or just pilfer something from an old D&amp;D module you&#39;ve got laying around.  Ignore the keys... leave blanks, right?<br /><br /></p>

        <p>Alright, that makes sense. And yeah, they&#39;re interested in it, in fact they came to me with something, and i quote &quot;Like Twilight, but better than Twilight&quot; so i made this. All they know about is the vampires and werewolves. I&#39;ll take the rest into consideration.</p>
