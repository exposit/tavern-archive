Thought Experiment:<br />How would you go about using <b>fronts</b> for other games than DW? (or Grim Portents?)<br /><br />I like the way every front has dangers associated and as a GM you have a way to tick off things that will happen (or not).<br />If it&#39;s fantasy you might be able to port it to another game without much work, isn&#39;t it?<br />But what if you use another genre?

        <p>It would revolutionise every other RPG out there</p>

        <p>You could port Dangers and Fronts to any other RPG with basically no effort at all. They&#39;re just tools for the GM to collect, organize, and keep track of campaign events and consequences.</p>

        <p>It <i>is</i> revolutioning games. A lot of the &quot;Apocalypse philosophy&quot; and techniques are oozing around, and proving themselves to be solid and adaptable. <br />The last <i>Vampire</i> book (20th anniversary Dark Age) includes rules that are like GM Principles and a trupe play modality that is basically PbA-style gaming, with &quot;hidden&quot; fronts. <br /><br />It&#39;s a little revolution in the gaming standards. ^^</p>

        <p>I agree to that. In other genres the narrative elements of grim portens and inpending doom are always aplyable. <br />And in some extant, I have use &quot;Story&quot;-Sheets before to organise the flow of the World. Fronts &amp; Dangers do that in a sleek and compressed way.</p>

        <p>Also: if you want other genres with similar concepts there are dozens of &quot;Powered by the Apocalypse&quot; games out there (the sister and cousins of <i>Dungeon World</i>) out there. <br /><br />My favorite ones are <i>Sagas of the Icelanders</i> and <i>Monsterhearts</i> ^^<br /><br />The world is your oyster!

        <p>In my perception Apocalypse World revolutionized especially the way we talk about RPGing. Vincent Baker has given us a new kind of vocabulary to talk about concepts, that have been mere individual thoughts before.<br />It&#39;s interesting that a particular game seems to be way more effective in doing so, than all the &quot;forgy&quot; design-theory...<br /><br />On the topic: fronts are very easy to adapt in fractal rules-sets (like PDQ, Universalis or FATE).<br />EDIT: Oh, and if you like OSR-Games, take a look at the <b>factions</b> in Stars Without Number:<br /><a href="http://rpg.drivethrustuff.com/product/86467/Stars-Without-Number-Free-Edition" class="ot-anchor">http://rpg.drivethrustuff.com/product/86467/Stars-Without-Number-Free-Edition</a></p>

        <p>I don&#39;t think that AW is anything different than the product and the natural evolution of Forge discussions. XD <br />AW language IS &quot;Forge language&quot; ;-)</p>

(also, that why on the Forge proper, as in the actual forum, we never talked about &quot;theory&quot; without a solid rooting in actual, concrete games. Sorry if I seem fussy about this, but &quot;Forge is about talking about abstract theory&quot; is a common misconception. Tell me if I start to be too pedantic ^^)</p>

        <p>I wouldn&#39;t say Fronts are that revolutionary, it&#39;s just that Vincent (as with so many things in Apocalypse World) took existing practices and presented them in a really clear and useful systemic way. And since Ezio mentioned Sagas, I  just wanted to say that I was never entirely happy with how fronts turned out in that game, it&#39;s the one thing I would redesign if I had to revise the game.<br /><br />As to how to use them in other games, I think if you boil it down, Fronts &amp; Grim Portents (&amp; their kin) are basically this:<br />1) you come up with agents (individuals, organizations, forces of nature...)<br />2) write down their goals and motivations and then extrapolate the consequences of their actions in pursuit of those goals.<br />3) You ask yourself what would happen if nobody stops them or messes with them, and break down the change from here to there in a few discrete steps.<br />4) You also ask yourself what their strengths are, how they are likely to behave, how are they going about it - those are their moves.<br /><br />During the session or in between sessions,  the agents make their moves in pursuit of their goals.<br />If nobody messes with them, when a required number of steps is complete, they get what they wanted (or more than they bargained for) and the consequences come to bear.<br /><br />It&#39;s basically a way to keep the world alive and evolving beyond the immediate actions of the PCs. It shows that there are other actors and forces at play.<br /><br />It&#39;s also (in most games) a way to provide obstacles &amp; adversity &amp; put pressure on the PCs, which creates (dramatic) conflict.<br /><br />The nature of the agents&#39; goals and their consequences is the thing that has to vary from setting to setting or genre to genre. For example a front with a wizard who is trying to open a portal that will release an eldritch horror that threatens the nature of reality is ok for a high fantasy game, but not a urban crime drama like The Hood (<a href="http://rpg.drivethrustuff.com/product/128165/The-Hood" class="ot-anchor">http://rpg.drivethrustuff.com/product/128165/The-Hood</a>).</p>

        <p>Well, if you consider almost everything in AW is &quot;just&quot; how Vincent managed to learn how to play <i>Sorcerer</i>... <br /><br />I don&#39;t know... AW hasn&#39;t revolutionary mechanics, once you take it apart, but the way they work together, the way its concepts work to highlight a new perspective on the hobby standards... I don&#39;t know what it is, but it&#39;s very effective, as a whole. </p>

        <p>I&#39;m using a Front in Lovecraftian Numenera. The extradimensional, crystalline superbeing the Lloigor is growing into the Earth, and will destroy humanity unless stopped. Grim portents: appearance of crystal growths all over, even hovering in midair without support. Attacks on PCs where crystals erupt inside their bodies. One PC is now imprisoned in a castle with body suspended, impaled by crystalline kebab skewers...</p>

        <p>I&#39;ve been conceptually using the idea of fronts for years but since playing DW my techniques is more &quot;formal&quot; and better organized. I&#39;ve used it with Numenera last year and D&amp;D this year.</p>
