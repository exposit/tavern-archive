Does the following Move idea work?<br />Characters have to sross a ricketty looking bridge above a deep, dark chasm.<br />Roll+dex<br />On a 10+ choose 3 of the following, on a 7-9 choose two;<br />You cross successfully.<br />The bridge does not collapse behind you<br />You do not drop 1 hand held item.

        <p>It sounds like Defy Danger, except the 7-9 options are standard GM moves rewritten for this scenario.</p>

        <p>Agreed; the move may have a different name; but all its still just Defy Danger; The name change could add spice as to not saying the same word so often but its no different; the only difference is you have the consequences prepared for this one situation in particular, for defying danger. </p>

        <p>I would use for the post-roll: &quot;On a hit, you make it across successfully; but on a 7-9, choose 1 as well: The bridge collapses behind you, or you lose something in the effort.&quot;<br /><br />Because everyone is going to choose &quot;you cross successfully&quot; otherwise.</p>

        <p>I tend to dislike mixing &amp; matching &quot;you do X&quot; and &quot;you avoid Y&quot; in <i>pick from the following</i> lists. Its sometimes unavoidable, but I bet you can avoid it.  <br /><br />Like, maybe like this instead:<br />10+ You make it across, no problem.<br />7-9 pick 1:<br />  - You make it across, but the bridge is damaged (cumulative -1 to future attempts to cross it)<br />  - You make it across, but drop something you were carrying; ask the GM what it was<br /> -  You make it only part-way across; you&#39;ll have to try again, but take +1 forward to do so.<br /><br />&lt;edit: which is really similar to what Noah said&gt;</p>

        <p>You&#39;ve made a &quot;must take&quot; option by putting &quot;you cross successfully&quot; on the list. You should try to avoid doing that.</p>

        <p>Sure. One way is to make the 10+ result a simple &quot;you do it&quot; (since that&#39;s what getting to choose three out of three options ends up being) and make the 7-9 result a choice between making it across but dropping something important or making it across but having the bridge collapse after everyone gets to the other side.</p>
