I recall an off hand remark some time ago about an alternate Bard based around a Signature Instrument. Seemed like a cool idea, but I haven&#39;t seen anything come of it, so here&#39;s my first pass at the idea for your use and/or critiquing:<br /><br />~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br /><i>Alternate class feature: A Bard may replace either Bardic Lore or Charming and Open with the following move. The move they choose to replace is added to their list of 2-5 Advanced Moves.</i><br /><br /><b>Signature Instrument</b><br />You carry a unique instrument, unlike any other. Tell us what it is, and how it looks; regardless of form, it has a base of 1 Weight for you.<br />Tell us how you acquired it, and from who:<br />* A gift.<br />* An inheritance.<br />* You stole it.<br />* You won it.<br />*<i>_____________</i><br />Finally, pick two features:<br />* Weaponized: Your instrument serves as a weapon, strong as any other. Select a single range tag; if your instrument requires ammo, you gain 3 ammo (1 Weight)<br />* Cantankerous: You may roll +CON rather than +CHA for Arcane Art when playing your instrument.<br />* Bane: One type of creature (your choice) cannot stand the sounds your instrument produces.<br />* Siren: One type of creature (your choice) finds your instrument&#39;s sounds especially soothing or enticing.<br />* Enchanted: Select a single rote or cantrip, and add it to the list of effects you may produce with Arcane Art.<br />* Armored: While you wield your instrument, you have +1 Armor. Increase your instrument&#39;s weight by 1.<br />* Collapsible: Reduce your instrument&#39;s weight by 1, and with a few moments&#39; work you can fold or otherwise transform it into a single alternate form, which may or may not be an instrument; describe it.<br />* Pristine: No matter how badly it&#39;s treated, your instrument sheds rust, rot, water and other nastiness, and may still be played.<br />

        <p>Dwarf Bard instruments are always cantankerous. ﻿<br /><br />I like this a lot btw.</p>

        <p>I&#39;m pretty sure I made that offhand comment! I love this so much. The Bane/Siren features are incredible and are making me think about the bard archetype in a whole new way.</p>
