Now she seeks to expand her power beyond the kitchen. Using secret recipes and forbidden herbs and spices she cooks up trouble for our heroes!<br /><br />- Control/animate food<br />- Speak a groan inducing pun<br />- Lure with a delicious aroma<br /><br /><br />Ginger Bread Golems<br />Group, Organized, Small<br />Special Qualities: Baked Construct, vulnerable to dunking<br />6hp<br />Instinct: Obey the chefcromancer that created them<br />Armor 1, Bite/pommel 1d8, close<br /><br />These flaky, golden delicious abominations are usually made in groups of 13, a deadly dozen as they are called.

Any edible substance that is put in the Oven is transformed after 60 seconds into a small pastry with frosting and delicious fruit filling, essentially making it a source of unlimited rations. A skilled Chefcromancer can also use this device to create more powerful creations, boosting their already formidable powers.
