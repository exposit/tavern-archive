So, this feels very DW to me... what do you think?  How would you adjudicate it?

Try this once. Don't track hit points. Every time a player character is hit by an attack  describe the wound the player takes. Tell them some negative effect it has.  You took a wound to your sword arm you have to switch to y...

        <p>I believe there&#39;s some posts on the story-games forums that have a way to do something like this with world of dungeons.  iirc, the GM describes the severity of the hit, then you roll what would have been damage.  The player can choose to either take the hit (and be blinded, or bleeding, or scarred, or without an arm) or spend the appropriate hp as &quot;plot armor&quot; to avoid it.  Was an interesting thought!</p>

        <p>This reminds me of Unknown Armies. I seem to recall that damage taken is kept secret by the GM, and the players have to rely on the GM&#39;s descriptions alone to estimate how hurt they are.</p>

        <p>Trollbabe has only two mechanical states for the main characters: &quot;wounded&quot;  and &quot;not wounded&quot;. <br />Other than that, all wounds, injuries, etc. are fictional elements. <br />So, if a Trollbabe or NPC has, let&#39;s say, a broken hand, they have to act accordingly.</p>
