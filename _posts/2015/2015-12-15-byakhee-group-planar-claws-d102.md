Byakhee   (Group, Planar)<br />Claws (d10+2 damage 1 piercing)  10 HP  1 Armor<br />Close, Far<br /><br />Byakhee are interstellar predators that travel the vacuum of space by means of an organ called a &quot;hune&quot;. This organ, located in the thorax of the creature, allows the creature to greatly surpass the speed of light by unknown means. The creature can also survive the interstellar vacuum unaided. If one had the means by which to survive the myriad threats space presents, than one could ride a Byakhee to anywhere in the cosmos. When travelling beyond the speed of light, the creature&#39;s metabolism is greatly increased. When descending to the surface of any given planet, it is usually to feed; it is best avoided. While on the earth&#39;s surface, Byakhee can fly at speeds up to 70 kph. The &quot;hune&quot; also allows them to hover on a planet&#39;s surface, using their wings for movement.<br /><br />Instinct: Swoop!<br /><br />Creature of the Void<br />Often serves Cthulhu Mythos Masters (Hastur)
