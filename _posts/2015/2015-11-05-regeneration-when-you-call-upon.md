Regeneration<br />When you call upon your regenerative powers to regrow lost flesh, name what you want back and Roll 2d+Con.<br /><br />On a 10+, your body part grows back in perfect condition and you heal d8 hp. On a 7-9, your body part comes back but it&#39;s exhausting. Choose 1:<br /><br />-Your flesh is tender, treat the next attack against you as if it had the  messy tag.<br />-A burdensome growth sprouts along with it. Lower your Load by 1 until it is shaved off.﻿

        <p>The 7-9 result seems harsh. Even though you succeed, you can lose another body part? Seems like there is no success there.</p>

        <p>It&#39;s no different than a success where you lose ammo or other equipment.<br /><br />You can just regenerate the retracted part.</p>

But in retrospect probably just thought it would be funny to have players play wack&#39;a&#39;mole with their bodies.<br /><br />I&#39;ll ditch the -1 forward and switch the second option with this. <br />-A burdensome growth sprouts along with it. Lower your load by 1 until it is shaved off.</p>

        <p>Hah, I love the burdensome growth. That would make the game much more interesting.</p>

        <p>Terrible/Hilarious regeneration incidents that could occur on -6:<br />-A blind, constantly screaming head sprouts instead of what you wanted.<br />-Your physiology re-arranges in a way that places your heart in an obvious, vulnerable position.<br />-The severed flesh grows into a creature of it&#39;s own.<br />-Your flesh won&#39;t stop growing and continues to do so at an alarming rate. </p>
