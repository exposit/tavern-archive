<b>When two moves could be one</b><br /><br /><span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink" href="https://plus.google.com/107768808673158860288" oid="107768808673158860288">Dennis Appell</a></span> raised the question of handling when a character does two things in one action.<br /><i>&quot;e.g.  Character is tied to a wooden chair with his arms strapped to the chair armrests. He breaks the arm off and smashes it into the face of the gloating antagonist hovering over him.&quot;</i><br /><br />In this case I&#39;d go with a single Hack &amp; Slash move because both actions use +STR and the Hack &amp; Slash results can easily cover teh full spectrum of the action (e.g. 10+ = clear success; 7-9 = break the chair but the attack has a problem; 6- = fail to break the chair + opponent&#39;s response).<br /><br />But what if they&#39;re slipping their chains (Defy Danger with +DEX) and using them for their attack (Hack &amp; Slash = +STR):<br />- Does this become two separate moves/rolls?<br />- Or do you handle it as one move? If so, which one?

        <p>To move the story along, combine it into one action. If the story is more focused on the restraints, use defy danger. If the focus is on the gloating antagonist, use hack &amp; slash.<br /><br />Now if you have a group who likes to roll dice, then roll for both. This gives characters who don&#39;t specialize in just Str or just Dex and are versatile to show off that fact.</p>

        <p>I can see a case for both here. One of the (sometimes frustrating) strengths of DW is that there are very few wrong ways o do things. As long as everyone in the group is OK with how things are being handled, rock on.</p>

        <p>Hmm... This is like my third try at a response to this... I&#39;m not sure I would consider slipping the chains as Defy Danger. Where is the danger if you&#39;re sitting there with a pina colada watching the big baddie monologue? Now he pulls a dagger and moves to stab you, now Roll+Dex (assuming that&#39;s how you choose to respond). For me, if the baddie is too engrossed in himself, let the person slip the chains without being noticed (just like auto killing someone who doesn&#39;t know you&#39;re there). Then attacking with the chains is H&amp;S if you were noticed, based on fiction</p>

        <p>If the baddie is not epicly monologuing, slipping chains would probably be DD, then move the fiction forward to that spot. So treat it as two moves. Just remember, DD is not the same as &quot;Stealth&quot; in other games</p>

        <p>&quot;Where is the danger if you&#39;re sitting there with a pina colada watching the big baddie monologue?&quot;<br />The danger here could be that the Big Bad notices your escape attempts. Or that you make your situation worse by tipping the chair over. It&#39;s all based on what else is happening.</p>

        <p>I like the use two moves at once technique and use it often,<br />although I never fail to find interesting situations for<br />defy danger with INT - Quick Thinking<br />Because in my mind, you can justify too many things<br />as quick thinking.</p>

        <p>Is the character the fighter? If so, they definitely have a move for breaking out of the chair. If they&#39;re not the fighter, I&#39;d be inclined to show them a limitation of their class, while offering another opportunity for escape to them or a nearby companion.</p>

        <p>I would make it two rolls, otherwise why not roll once for every stat at the start of the session and keep that result for every action the rest of the session?</p>

Personally, I&#39;d say that escaping and going after your enemy sound like two distinct things no matter how you do it, so I&#39;d make it two rolls. Needing to Defy Danger before you can trigger some other move is one of the more interesting ways of modeling more difficult or dangerous situations in DW, so I don&#39;t see a problem with it.<br /><br />That said, I&#39;d likely let them escape no matter the result of the DD roll. Escaping from chains is interesting, being tied up while a bad guy mocks or stabs you is just frustrating.</p>

        <p>Yeah I would make it two moves. In fact this is how you make monsters so dangerous. In that you make it so before a player can attack them you have to defy danger.</p>

You&#39;re probably right. But the fact that I think it is absurd to use just one roll for two completely different actions is still my just own opinion. And you are completely within your rights to think and say that I am absurd. (As long as we do it in a civilized way ☺)</p>

        <p>I personally thought <span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink" href="https://plus.google.com/111256963556395023796" oid="111256963556395023796">Wynand Louw</a></span> was making a valid point. Combining moves just because they use the same stat? <br />Skipping the Defy Danger roll because having the character stay bound isn&#39;t very interesting, now that&#39;s valid in my book. With that justification, it doesn&#39;t matter if they are dexterously escaping or doing it with brute force. They want to escape, they are capable of escape, so they escape. <br /><br />Since there&#39;s timing involved though, I would think that it would be best to make a Defy Danger roll. (But a Fighter could use the Bend Bars, Lift Gates move instead, which would give them a nice spotlight moment) Then if you make that, it&#39;s time for the Hack and Slash. </p>

        <p>Read the table and where you are in the narrative or action and then have them roll whatever you think advances the fun. Don&#39;t worry about cleaving to the DW orthodoxy. Or to put it another way...<br /><br />Help everyone have fun and don&#39;t be a dick shall be the whole of the law.</p>

        <p>Getting out of a chair you are bound to isn&#39;t Drfy Danger UNLESS you need to do so to avoid something unpleasant happening. <br /><br />So as always, it depends.<br /><br />When you want to attack someone before they hit you with a mace, defy danger. When we are done with that roll we&#39;ll see if you can Hack&amp;Slash them.</p>

        <p>I would handle it with a Defy Danger.  The danger being defied is the baddie noticing you allowing him to react.  So I&#39;d let the player describe what he does (because he could do it with, for example, CHA by saying the right things to keep the baddie talking, or dex to just do it quietly/quickly).  On 10+, it works and the baddie is caught unawares unable to act.  On 7-9. it works, but with a drawback the player chooses (perhaps the attack hits but he trips over the chair leaving him prone, or it&#39;s slow so baddie gets an attack in too, or he&#39;s up, fast enough to swing without notice, but misses, so no damage).  A miss would signify that he didn&#39;t get out and Baddie noticed the attempt</p>

The Fighter specifically has a move that deals with this and I like the idea of showing the limitations of the other classes when it comes to brawn (a thief could get out with his class moves as well).<br /><br />For other classes I would probable require a series of defy dangers in order to free oneself.</p>

        <p>I would (almost) always make two rolls out of situation. I think making one Defy Danger roll to quietly escape being tied to the chair before throwing punches would decide whether the hero escapes and gets a weapon (chair leg), breaks free and either hurts themselves or takes longer, or still has their arms and hands tied to the intact chair. Then, after the first roll, can roll to spin around with a chair on their back (or what-have-you) using STR and Hack &amp; Slash.<br /><br />I don&#39;t like lumping both actions of escaping and attacking into one roll, unless your group really, really needs everything to move at the speed of light.<br /><br />I do like what a few have said that which class/character is tied down would have an impact on what they could use to try and escape/attack.</p>

        <p>To me, letting the dice take part in the story is almost as important as the stories created by everyone at the table. Lumping both actions into one decisive roll would feel like cheating for me. Remember the scenes when James Bond was tied up, eventually to take out everyone in the room in some crazy way, maybe getting shot in the process? If it was in DW/AW, I imagine he would have been making tough decisions on which rolls he wanted to make and when, and, during every major moment in those cramped, intense spots, had a chance to fail. And he did fail, at least a small bit, hence the scrapes and bruises.<br />For me, if someone wants to go ham on a big bad dude after getting themselves into this situation, I would want them to work for it and give them more chances to partially fail if they want to do something crazy. And if they are a thief escaping handcuffs or a fighter breaking out of a chair, then that shouldn&#39;t be a problem for them, right? Go ahead, try to get out of those cuffs without being caught. <b>wink wink nudge nudge</b><br />Though as people say all of the time: with AW and DW there are few wrong ways to do things, it&#39;s up to the people at the table to decide things like even just how you&#39;re going to use the rules.</p>
