        <p>My last post (12 days ago) was on a similar topic. <br />By the way, is there any news on &quot;Inglorious&quot;? The last info I can find is 18 months old.</p>

Adam says they&#39;re working hard on it and I&#39;m glad. I trust their discretion to release it when it&#39;s perfect so... <br /><br />&quot;sage is finishing the layout of juntu right now. Inglorious has gone through iterations and been reconstructed several times. I think we just need to finalize some things and buy arts.&quot; - Adam Koebel</p>
