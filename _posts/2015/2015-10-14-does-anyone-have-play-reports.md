Does anyone have play reports or articles from a GM perspective where you used a Dungeon Starter? They don&#39;t jive with my normal method of prep, so I need more than a little nudging to fully understand.

        <p>It&#39;s all based on the free form nature of Dungeon World, which can vary from group to group. Say you gather together a group of newbies and decide to use George Miller&#39;s The Goblin Hole Starter.<br /><br />You might start by asking them the questions:<br /><br />Whose idea was it to come here?<br /><br />How long will the ponies be OK without you?<br />This far from civilization, what was the last thing<br />you saw as you entered the cavern?<br />You weren&#39;t sure before but what is the smell that<br />keeps getting stronger as the cavern&#39;s entrance<br />disappears from view?<br />What have you sworn to do here?<br />What scares you the most as you darkness looms<br />closer?<br /><br />Maybe mock up a little map while they answer of 5-8 rooms while they answer. Decide to hit them with the starlings move in the first cavern, the <br />debris shaft, and then the swinging log. Maybe add a fungus garden where the goblins grow crops, a slave pen for the kids, a communal chamber and lab room for the orkcaster. A secret exit turns out to be a good idea, too. Pepper and salt with your ideas and the starters. Improv at your comfort level. Maybe use the dungeon generator in the DMG or Perilous Wilds to help. <br /><br />The party rescues the kids and all is joy. Until they discover the wizard has caught the goblin pox and is turning into a goblin. As are the kids and the now the villagers....next adventure!</p>

I think the idea of &quot;use the monsters and moves to generate the next room&quot; is the bit I was missing. I was seeing a bunch of ideas, but not really how to make it something tangible.<br /><br />My general prep usually involves rough locations and spirals out from there. I guess the Moves are pretty similar though - &quot;when you are hit by a swinging log&quot; implies a room with a swinging log trap.</p>

        <p>I&#39;ve found this useful as well: <a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/3269630/dwdotcom/eon-guide/Dungeon%20World%20Guide%20pdf%20version%201.2.pdf" class="ot-anchor">https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/3269630/dwdotcom/eon-guide/Dungeon%20World%20Guide%20pdf%20version%201.2.pdf</a></p>

        <p>Here&#39;s an actual play report from the first (?) time I ran DW, based on a starter that I had written as prep. Not sure it&#39;s <i>quite</i> what you&#39;re looking for, since using your own starter isn&#39;t quite the same as using someone else&#39;s.<br /><br /><a href="http://apocalypse-world.com/forums/index.php?topic=2808.msg16790#msg16790" class="ot-anchor">http://apocalypse-world.com/forums/index.php?topic=2808.msg16790#msg16790</a><br /><br />There&#39;s a link in there to the original starter I worked off of.  Here&#39;s an updated version if you&#39;re interested:<br /><br /><a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B0lFq3ECDQDQeTkxMjd5WnVxMWc" class="ot-anchor">https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B0lFq3ECDQDQeTkxMjd5WnVxMWc</a></p>
