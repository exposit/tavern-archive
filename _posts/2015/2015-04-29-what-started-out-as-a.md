What started out as a more rigid dungeon, I eventually scrapped and it became this more .. organic cave system, I suppose. I&#39;m very new to designing dungeons, but I really enjoy how this one turned out.<br /><br />This is the makeshift home of a tribe of kobolds and a large monster called a &quot;Gworth&quot;, who makes its home in the largest room toward the southwest. The large tunnel leading to the hole in the first room is how it comes in and out of the caves.﻿<br /><br />(I also posted this to another community)

This is the makeshift home of a tribe of kobolds and a large monster called a "Gworth", who makes its home in the largest room toward the southwest. The large tunnel leading to the hole in the first room is how it comes in and out of the caves.﻿</a>

        <p>I love how each map I&#39;ve seen here seems to build on the work of others, while adding its own voice. It&#39;s kind of a cartographic conversation.</p>

        <p>Has anyone ever tried using a real life cave system as a basis for dungeon creation?  Then going through it and adding worked areas, flooring other areas.  Not really applicable to Dungeon World - but it would be an interesting exercise.</p>
