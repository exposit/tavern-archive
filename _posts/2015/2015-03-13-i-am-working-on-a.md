I am working on a handful of custom moves and need some ideas and / or inspiration. I would love to hear any if you have them...<br /><br />I am looking to finish this move (I am picturing something that would be in a cheesy action movie):<br /><br />Conserve Energy: You know how to conserve your strength for when you really need it. When you consume a ration after a full nights rest, hold 1. You may spend your hold 1 for 1 to do any of the following:<br /> - Perform an amazing feat of athletics<br /> - 
 -<br /><br />Besides that, I am looking for moves based around survival, history, and mechanics (my players are looking to play a survivalist, a historian, and a grease monkey for a custom campaign). Any cool thoughts or ideas?

        <p>I know, it&#39;s a cheap hint, however you could give a read to &quot;Class Warfare&quot;. Maybe you could find something already created, that you can adopt easily.<br /><a href="http://img.4plebs.org/boards/tg/image/1397/18/1397180818988.pdf" class="ot-anchor">http://img.4plebs.org/boards/tg/image/1397/18/1397180818988.pdf</a><br />Here&#39;s a playtest draft, almost final version. If you like it, you could throw some money on the final version, and make the author happy! :D<br /><a href="http://rpg.drivethrustuff.com/product/137634/Class-Warfare" class="ot-anchor">http://rpg.drivethrustuff.com/product/137634/Class-Warfare</a></p>

        <p>well there is a survivor and mechanic book for I think it&#39;s inverse world that you might be able to get some direction from.</p>

        <p>That &quot;survivor&quot; is more a Hokuto No Ken class. Dunno if it&#39;s in the spirit of the OP.</p>
