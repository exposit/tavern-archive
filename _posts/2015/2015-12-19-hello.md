Hello. I&#39;m curious as  about the GM Principle: &#39;Make a Move that follows&#39;. How have you used it? What does it really mean?

        <p>Mostly, it means that you should make moves that make sense given the fictional setup. <br /><br />Like, say the party has already thoroughly searched a room and even Discerned Realities, asked questions and gotten answers that make it clear the room is &quot;safe&quot; (at least for now). The wizard then Spouts Lore about the weird creature they just fought and killed in the prior room. She biffs the roll.<br /><br />As the GM, I can make any move I want, as hard as I want, as long as I follow my principles.  I&#39;m not going to be like &quot;suddenly ogres! they were hiding!&quot; because that doesn&#39;t follow the fiction and the moves that triggered it.  <br /><br />Instead, I might reveal an unwelcome truth about the monster they just killed (&quot;you&#39;ve never seen anything like it, but hey, what&#39;s with those weird blue lines creeping up Jasmir&#39;s arms from where the thing bit him?&quot;) or tell them the requirements and ask (&quot;seemed like some sort of corporeal undead, obviously, but you won&#39;t know no more unless you go back and spend some time dissecting it.&quot;)</p>

        <p>&quot;I kick him in the face&quot;<br />Rolls 6-<br />&quot;He ducks, grabs your ankle and twists it. He uses your momentum to slam you face first into the tarmac. Take 1d8 damage. And your nose is broken and full of gravel.&quot;<br /><br />All it means is that the move logically follows the fiction the player set up in his move. If a player tries to kick a guy in the face but misses his roll the move that follows is not a piano falling on his head.</p>
