<b>Whats counts as Leverage?</b><br /><br />Hi all,<br /><br />Great community here.  Full of insights and interesting ideas.  The Tavern has definitely helped to make Dungeon World a lively and fun game for my group.<br /><br />The question above was inspired by my conversations with <span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink" href="https://plus.google.com/110330901807759406775" oid="110330901807759406775">Tim Franzke</a></span> about <span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink" href="https://plus.google.com/112155385682843462205" oid="112155385682843462205">Anthony Giovannetti</a></span>&#39;s DW hacks and how certain moves could be used for Leverage in <b>Parley</b>.<br /><br />I&#39;d love to hear your thoughts on <i>when</i> and <i>why</i>, as well as your favorite examples from actual play.  My hope is to make this thread a resource for GMs and players alike.<br /><br />And who knows?

        <p>I was running a one-shot for my friend and his sons (ages 12 and 9) and was playing pretty loose with the rules.<br /><br />The nine-year-old was a wizard and he was using parley on a local for information, threatening to turn him into a worm if the guy didn&#39;t talk.<br /><br />He rolled a 7-9 and the guy called his bluff, so he turned him into a worm and then back again. The guy spilled the beans after that.</p>

        <p>The move itself would be parley or the result of a move could lead to leverage? What are some examples of this?</p>

        <p>The fighter is in melee with a guard and announces that she wants to parry their attacks and then pin them to the wall with her sword. She rolls Hack and Slash, 10+. The bard uses the fighter&#39;s presence as the leverage (threat of violence) and the GM gives him +1 Forward on it.</p>

        <p>I like moves that grant you leverage and tell you why you have it. For example:<br /><br />Break the News<br />When you tell them just how bad off someone is or isn’t, you can use your composure as leverage to Parley.</p>

But, if you&#39;re in a spot, you could roll on the 100 instincts list (pp. 390-391) for an inspiration.</p>

        <p>Moves like that show how a type of character can reliably leverage situations. For example, a lawyer could reliably use legalese to Parley against non-lawyers/judges or a noble could reliably use their social status to Parley with serfs.</p>

        <p>Yes. They can that because they have legal knowledge or social standing. <br />That is like <br /><br />&quot;When you have a gun - you can shoot it&quot;</p>

        <p>If you don&#39;t have leverage <i>yet</i>, do you mean you can get it based on the result of your move results?<br /><br />If you want to use force, I see what you mean that you would Hack&amp;Slash to hurt someone, and now use that as your leverage - but how do you decide how much of a success is enough to gain leverage? What if you get a 10+ and roll 1 damage? What if you roll a 7-9 and take damage as well while dealing your maximum damage? What distinguishes when the leverage is acquired?</p>

        <p>It doesn&#39;t have to be mechanical. As long as the narrative supports the leverage logically then they have it. You can modulate how effective it is with the NPC&#39;s reaction or a +/- Forward.</p>

        <p>You could have a gun but be unable to fire it. Putting leverage in a move bypasses the fictional positioning normal required to make the subsequent move. It also calls out an unusual source of leverage.</p>

I am pretty sure he gives exactly zero frigs about my legalese. And I doubt the ideological, rabble-rousing leader of the peasant revolt cares about a noble&#39;s social status. Giving me moves that say they do, period, robs those characters of their internal consistency.<br /><br />I like moves that say &quot;when you use __ as leverage, take +1 to Parley&quot; or &quot;roll +__ to Parley.&quot;  That&#39;s solid. But saying &quot;you can always use scary-looking gun to parley, even against Demogorgon&quot; is pretty lame.</p>

        <p>My favorite example of Parley I can remember...<br /><br /><b>Bard</b>:  &quot;We&#39;re looking for this guy Valleois. He&#39;s got something of ours. Why don&#39;t you help us find him?&quot;<br /><br /><b>Gang Leader</b>: &quot;What&#39;s in it for us?&quot;<br /><br /><b>Bard</b>: &quot;Does a finely dressed gentleman like me look like I need Valleois&#39;s pocket change? All we want is the decanter he&#39;s carrying. Everything else that thief has on him is yours.&quot;  &lt;rolls Parley 7-9&gt;<br /><br /><b>Gang Leader</b>: &lt;looks down at bard&#39;s feet, back up to eyes&gt;  &quot;Yeah, okay. But gimme your boots.&quot;<br /><br /><b>Bard</b>: &lt;who is actually down to his last few coin&gt; &quot;My boots?&quot;<br /><br /><b>Gang Leader</b>: &quot;Fine pair of boots.

Normally, you&#39;d need leverage but this move lets you set up a situation wherein you have a different kind of coercive power. When you go to parlay, you don&#39;t need leverage because you already have that in toward getting what you want.</p>

I think we had one character death following that encounter then we went back to deal with that character&#39;s funeral stuff. That seemed to soften up his feelings toward us, I think, since before this he thought we were pretty cool. On the heels of that we had a dispute arise between two characters and one of them left (likely to assume NPC status in the future) and then another fight happened in the tavern before we left again, partly the consequence of that dispute and partly because things hadn&#39;t been settled with what we were investigating that led to the first character death.<br /><br />One of the PCs in the dispute left when we returned to our investigation because he didn&#39;t seem compatible with the group at this point. We found a replacement for him somewhat quickly but we ended up having another character death, so we are heading back to town to deal with that and look for more help.<br /><br />I am not solid on what the innkeeper thinks of our group at this point, because all of this has happened over the course of a few days in the fiction. He might be more forgiving because we are on a quest and generally have been okay before this, but I guess we&#39;ll see.</p>

What did you do for the results from <i>Last Breath</i>?</p>

        <p>The character who ended up coming back from death rolled a 7-9 and the other two outright failed. Each character got a kind of personalized encounter with Death, developed by the GM. Because of that, the character who survived got off a bit light since he was already sort of Death-aligned in the first place. The Thief got shown to a house with a party inside and given the opportunity to steal from the guests. The Druid got sent to a natural setting where he could shapechange and remain in that form, hunting alongside wild animals.</p>

        <p>I don&#39;t know yet because those are the only deaths we&#39;ve had. I think the Death scenes were basically, &quot;You had your life and now it&#39;s over, so let&#39;s have you resign to something that&#39;s thematically appropriate for your character.&quot;</p>
