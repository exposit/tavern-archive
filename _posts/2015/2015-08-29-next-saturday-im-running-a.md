Next Saturday, I&#39;m running a one-on-one game for my daughter. This will be her first time playing any RPG, and we are both stoked. <br /><br />She wants to play what is basically a Dragonborn fighter. When I asked her what his racial special abilities are, she said that he can breathe fire and had wings and can fly.<br /><br />The flight, I&#39;ll just straight up allow. No custom moves or anything. But the fire breath, I think, should be something special.<br /><br />What do you folks think of this?<br /><br />When you try to harm an opponent by breathing fire, roll +DEX. On a 10+, deal 1d6 damage. On a 7-9, deal 1d4 damage and take a complication.<br /><br />I think it might be cool if with a roll of 12+ the damage is ongoing. But I&#39;m not sure how to work that.<br /><br />Since this is just a one-on-one game, I&#39;m not too worried about balance, but I also don&#39;t want for her to just go around setting everything ablaze. Do you think the 9- option will be a good deterent (I imagine things like setting other things and people on fire, accidentally setting a resource on fire, and other GM moves unrelated to the fire), or should I somehow limit how often she can breathe fire?

        <p>Maybe the breath weapon is the signature weapon.</p>

        <p>Yeah, <span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink" href="https://plus.google.com/113927217394445366066" oid="113927217394445366066">Marshall Miller</a></span>Â hits this right on the head! Who needs custom moves. Maybe let her also get moves from the Immolator!</p>

        <p>Or, just go for it and let her be a dragon!<br /><br /><a href="https://plus.google.com/114493035025354983838/posts/KC7JMGDc8Hx" class="ot-anchor">https://plus.google.com/114493035025354983838/posts/KC7JMGDc8Hx</a></p>

        <p>When you&#39;ve had a rest and had time to catch your breath, roll+endurance  <br />On a 10+, hold 2 <br />On a 7-9, hold 1<br />On a 6-, your stomach gases need help to build up - if you choose to consume a ration, hold 1<br /><br />Roll it like Druid shape shifting when she actually uses it - basically let her describe a fire breath thing.<br /><br />Also? Who cares about balance? It&#39;s a one on one, let her literally spread her wings a bit. DW is good like that - balance against monsters comes from the &#39;anything you can do...&#39; School of GM escalation :)</p>

        <p>Also, maybe resist the urge to let her deal damage with it, but show her the benefits of setting fires - smoke screens, intimidation...</p>

        <p>I&#39;d set a bigger damage...what her class damage anyway? It sound like a technique, area, fire element. She deal damage anyway, but on 9- set something else on fire.</p>

        <p>I have a player as a dragonborn and her special ability is that she can become a dragon as one of her animals. Basically make it like the shapeshifting of a druid and have breqthing fire and flying as the animals moves</p>

        <p>Without other players there doesn&#39;t need to be balance, or classes come to think of it! Just keep to the 10+ awesome, 7-9 complication, 6- bad times rule and just roll with it!<br /><br />When you fly, roll with DEX.<br /><br />When you breathe fire, roll with CON.<br /><br />When you shatter with tooth and claw, roll with STR.<br /><br />When you use dragon magic to...<br />...sense treasure<br />...be understood by lesser beings<br />...reveal magic or the hidden<br />...control an element<br />Roll with CHA/WIS/INT.<br /></p>

        <p>You should check out the Backer Classes that were made. The Dragonslayer has some great ideas that would apply well in building and leveling this character.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/237216454/Dungeon-World-Backer-Classes-CC-1up#scribd" class="ot-anchor">http://www.scribd.com/doc/237216454/Dungeon-World-Backer-Classes-CC-1up#scribd</a></p>
