Hello people who like Dungeon World adventures!<br /><br />My campaign framework <i>Plague of Storms</i> is going to be tomorrow&#39;s Deal of the Day on DriveThruRPG - which means for one day only you can get it for 50% off! (Or something like that. I&#39;ve actually forgotten what discount I selected, but it&#39;s in that ballpark.)
