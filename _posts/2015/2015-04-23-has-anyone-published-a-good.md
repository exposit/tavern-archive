Has anyone published a good alt-Fighter who is more a soldier-ish master of whatever weapon is handy vs. the signature weapon fighter of the DW Corebook?

        <p>There&#39;s the Gladiator. It&#39;s pretty fantastic. Let me see if I can find it.</p>

        <p>In &quot;Class Warfare&quot; there&#39;s an option for the &quot;Assassin&quot; specialty called &quot;Improvised Weapon&quot;. Super simple rule, but it might be useful to throw in for a class, possibly as an advancement option?<br /><br />Improvised Weapon<br />Anything solid that you can pick up, you can use as a weapon with<br />the appropriate range (usually hand).Â </p>

        <p>Cool, and I like the Gladiator! Mostly I was looking for a playbook for fighters who <b>don&#39;t</b> rock the signature weapon, like Violet from Rat Queens.</p>

        <p>Also you can search for the actually incomplete official DW expansion &quot;Inglorious&quot; where you can find useful stuff for a war-based DW campaign (and an alternative Fighter, of course). I hope they put an end to that manual, sooner or later... <a rel="nofollow" class="ot-hashtag" href="https://plus.google.com/s/%23blamesage/posts">#blamesage</a></p>

        <p>The War Torn Vet can play as either a squad leader type or a bitter survivor.Â  He&#39;s got the ability to apply tags to any weapon he grabs, although the Gladiator may suit your needs better depending on the flavor you&#39;re seeking.<br /><br />When I first started putting this guy together it was just going to be a series of alternate moves for the default Fighter class.<br /><br /><a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/jt14eraxx0yg4mk/TheWarTornVet.pdf?dl=0" class="ot-anchor">https://www.dropbox.com/s/jt14eraxx0yg4mk/TheWarTornVet.pdf?dl=0</a></p>

I feel it more balanced toward the old fighter class. Also, then I have  a Forge move to apply tags permanently, and to add a magical property in another move. </p>

Also, I wrote them in italian, for a locale project. However, please, please forgive me if I attach here an autotranslation from Google. I know, it&#39;s silly and quite funny as english, however you can have a look at the overall thing:<br /><br />Its like to breathe<br />Nobody knows the weapons as you. In your hands, a rough piece of steel becomes a refined instrument of death. When you have a little free time (eg while you&#39;re Camped), you can study one of your weapons to get used to its quirks and imagine your next fights while you wield. Choose from the list three different improvements: while wielding the weapon, your fighting style can take advantage of the new features and labels.<br />â—‹ Balanced: you can throw it with ease, and add ðŸ”–lancio ðŸ”–vicino.<br />â—‹ Convenient: you get used to its size, weight -1.<br />â—‹ bloody: inflicts ðŸ”– + 1 damage.<br />â—‹ Defensive: gives you ðŸ”– +1 armor.<br />â—‹ Disruptive: can inflict damage ðŸ”–stun, your choice.<br />â—‹ Destructive: ðŸ”–devastante adds.<br />â—‹ Unstoppable: ðŸ”–possente adds.<br />â—‹ Insidious: adds ðŸ”– + 2 drilling.<br />â—‹ Manageable: ðŸ”–precisa adds.<br />â—‹ Peculiar: create a label to describe the benefit obtained (eg ðŸ”–avviluppante, ðŸ”–spezzalame, ðŸ”–robusta, etc.)<br />â—‹ Versatile: adds a ray adjacent to those already possessed ðŸ”–ravvicinato, ðŸ”–mischia, ðŸ”–allungo, ðŸ”–vicino, ðŸ”–lontano.<br /><br /><br />Artist Steel<br />When you have access to a forge, materials and time available (at least a day), you can work on a weapon to try to perfect it. Tira + INT. âœ¦ With 7+, choose an improvement from the list of E &#39;as breathing. The weapon gains that improvement permanently, even if contested by others. âœ¦ With 7-9, choose a unexpected from the list below. âœ¦ With 6-, something went wrong. The Master will tell you what (you may even have to throw away the weapon).<br />Unexpected:<br />â—‹ To complete the work you need the material particular or expensive. The Master will tell you what.<br />â—‹ Uses longer than expected. The Master will tell you how. If you&#39;re in a hurry, you can leave the work in half and finish it as soon as possible, you already know how much time will take you away.<br />â—‹ The weapon earns a label is not provided. The Master will tell you which (perhaps ðŸ”–fragile, ðŸ”–appariscente, ðŸ”–manutenzione, ðŸ”–sbilanciata).<br />You can not improve a weapon a second time.<br /><br /><br />Bellows and souls<br />Require: Artist Steel<br />When working on a weapon to perfect it, you can infuse part of your soul with a ritual similar to that <i>____</i> bonfire. The ritual will awaken the magical energies dormant in it, resonating with the experiences: for this reason, the ritual is usually done on a weapon that has already been used in combat. The gun is considered ðŸ”–magica. Moreover, pulls + INT. âœ¦ With 7+, choose a power from the following list. The weapon gains that power permanently, although contested by others. âœ¦ With 7-9, choose a unexpected from the list next. âœ¦ With 6-, something went wrong. The Master will tell you what (you may even have to throw away the weapon).<br />Powers:<br />â—‹ Alert: weapon shines in the presence of a creature type. Choose between: <i>____</i><br />â—‹ chastening: your attack earns ðŸ”–migliore against a creature type. Choose between: <i>____</i><br />â—‹ Blessed by the Gods: the weapon is considered ðŸ”–divina.<br />â—‹ Companion: the weapon is always a way back into your hands.<br />â—‹ Eternal: the weapon is ðŸ”–indistruttibile. The Master will reveal, however, the only way they can be destroyed.<br />â—‹ Burning: the weapon can burn with fire magic on command, causing ðŸ”– + 1d4 damage.<br />â—‹ Awakened: the weapon is intelligent and can communicate with the carrier.<br />â—‹ Sculptress: the weapon can cut through the stone like meat.<br />â—‹ Terebrante: the weapon gains ðŸ”–ignora armor.<br /><br />Unexpected:<br />â—‹ The weapon develops self-awareness. The Master will tell you when that might be useful or indisposed.<br />â—‹ The weapon could riverbererare towards others, or cause collateral damage.<br />â—‹ The weapon is stained by <i>_______</i>, and is considered ðŸ”–maledetta. Will be perceived by the enemies of that group even at a great distance.<br /><br />â—‹<br />And &#39;possible to perform the ritual on a weapon already improved before: the weapon will retain the previous features.<br /><br /><br />Communion<br />When you cross a battlefield and perceive the traces of past souls and sparks of flames now turned off, you can get an insight on the current situation, but you might have to bare your soul, responding to voices on the wind. Tira + CAR. 10+ on the Master will give you the details useful. 7-9 with the Master will give only a general impression.<br /><br /><br />Bringer of destruction<br />When you deal damage with a weapon perfected, if the enemy has armor, reduce its value to 1, up to a minimum of 0.<br /><br /><br />Study the opponent<br />When you observe well your enemy, pulls + SAG. With a success, you will know instinctively what it is dangerous, as it can cause damage, and if it has particular strengths. With 10+, there is also at least one exploitable weakness to begin to address it.<br />with 6-, tell the Master something that makes you vulnerable here and now, in addition to the move that will do.<br /></p>

        <p>Made a little playtest, no problems at all. It&#39;s balanced with the &quot;old&quot; class, and simply shift the focus between the specific &quot;heirloom weapon&quot; and the &quot;favorite weapon of the day&quot;. Also gives a little bit flexibility to the fighter, so he can tinker a little too during the adventures, even not reaching the absolute narrative freedom of the druid, for example.</p>
