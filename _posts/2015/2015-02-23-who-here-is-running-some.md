Who here is running some <a rel="nofollow" class="ot-hashtag" href="https://plus.google.com/s/%23DungeonWorld/posts">#DungeonWorld</a>  at PAX East this year?   I have run several campaigns since I picked it up last PAX East, but I am really ready give playing it a try.  Anyone have an open spot?

        <p>There will sessions of DW running at Games on Demand in the Tabletop hall, though not at specific scheduled times. We&#39;ll also have a bunch of other great games!</p>
