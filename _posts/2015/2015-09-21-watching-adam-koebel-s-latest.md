Watching <span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink" href="https://plus.google.com/112484087750169360510" oid="112484087750169360510">Adam Koebel</a></span> &#39;s latest Roll20 session (specifically character creation) put an idea in my head.<br /><br />I&#39;ve been really enjoying my campaigns and one-shots which start <i>in medias res</i> , avoiding the <b><i>Meet in Tavern</i></b> trope, but when Adam said <i>&quot;We have a Dwarf, a Halfling and a Human&quot;</i> I couldn&#39;t help but want to start a game in a twist on the old <b>&quot;Three Disparate People walk into a Bar&quot;</b> joke setup:<br /><br />1: Go through character creation as normal, maybe skip bonds for the moment.<br /><br />2. Announce <i>&quot;An [A], a [B] and a [C] walk into a tavern...&quot;</i> , for whatever values you have in race/class/alignment. Ham it up.<br /><br />3: <i>You&#39;re recounting old stories of things you did together in the past. What big adventure did you barely survive?</i> (Maybe use this to generate at least one bond each)<br /><br />4. <i>What has happened recently to dredge up all that old unpleasantness, and bring you back together in a pub so close to where it all happened, even though you swore you&#39;d never return?</i> (this could help generate another bond, and starts setting up the adventure)<br /><br />5. <i>Why is it so much worse this time, in different ways for each of you?</i><br /><br />6. Finish your drinks, steel your resolve, and head out to face the threat...

        <p>I might re-write point 4 to place emphasis on the stakes each character has in this adventure (family to save, honour to defend, deity to impress/appease, debts to pay, etc)</p>
