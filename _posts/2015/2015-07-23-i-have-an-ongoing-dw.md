I have an ongoing DW game on Roll20. I have 3 really good players, but we&#39;ve been looking for 1 or 2 more. The existing characters are a Barbarian, a Druid, and a Ranger/Cleric. Any of the remaining base classes are available.<br /><br />We play Thur nights 6p - 10p PST on Roll20. I&#39;m looking for someone who can be <b>reliable</b> in showing up to the game, and <b>willing to participate</b> in the forum discussions and the like.<br /><br />Anyone on here interested? If so please just send me a reply. Thanks!

        <p>Can do, I guess (I&#39;m in EST, time is usually free by this point). Couple of questions: <br />1) Serious(ish) or gonzo?<br />2) how long you plan the campaign to be from this point?</p>
