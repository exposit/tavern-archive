I don&#39;t like druid&#39;s Shapeshifter move, so I&#39;m going to change it (and probably make a new druid class geared around it at some point).<br /><br /> <a rel="nofollow" class="ot-hashtag" href="https://plus.google.com/s/%23dungeonworld/posts">#dungeonworld</a>   <a rel="nofollow" class="ot-hashtag" href="https://plus.google.com/s/%23druids/posts">#druids</a>   <a rel="nofollow" class="ot-hashtag" href="https://plus.google.com/s/%23shapeshifter/posts">#shapeshifter</a>

Like most of the Dungeon World classes, I don't like the druid. Part of my problem is By Nature Sustained: I think it's kind of strange that all druids no longer need to eat or drink, period (just like I think it's strange that all cleric's have Turn Undead).

        <p> I always tought that druids didn&#39;t need to check out rations because they ate of what they found in the forests, not just because they were non-eaters. Well, you&#39;re right, that move gives to misunderstanding</p>

        <p>Also, as a house rule, failing a roll when shapeshifting, on anytime in animal shape drives the animal instincts higher, to the point in which the druid can actually get trapped in the new form. Is not turning into animal when you should roll, but trying to revert back into human shape.<br /><br />(also in my games, damage is purely narrative, no damage dice, so mauling means just that: rolling to maul)</p>

        <p>I like that direction in general. Something about the -1 int/wis/cha feels arbitrary, like just turning into a wolf shouldn&#39;t make you dumber, but then there&#39;s gotta be some trade off so it&#39;s probably good. <br /><br />My biggest thing with shapeshifting RAW is it allows unlimited number of different forms, including fantastical ones (rocs, dragons, unicorns, etc). And that&#39;s where it sorta trumps other playbooks. I mitigate in play by asking Druid players to specify forms they&#39;re familiar with at char gen (usually 3) and usually make them wait until level ups to learn new ones. <br /><br />So I would like to see any revised version address that.</p>

        <p>a rule we imposed on our druid was that he can only use each form once a day. which mechanically doesn&#39;t change much, but at least means there&#39;s variety. especially once he picked up chimera :)<br /><br />I think the hold-spending makes as much sense as you want it to in a way: the druid borrows the spirit of the animal to perform a move, and can only have as much energy as the rolls permit? a little bit more fiction and it makes a lot more sense.<br /><br />I think my gripe with it is that you can just do it over and over though. success is 3 hold. partial is ..2/3 of that? doesn&#39;t quite sit right with me. how about:<br />on a 7 - 9, gain 2 hold and choose one:<br />- the animal&#39;s instincts are uncontrollable<br />- you test the land&#39;s patience, -1 ongoing to shapeshift until you rest<br />- your transformation causes panic, amongst nearby folk or the party</p>

        <p>+1 Ongoing to a stat for however long you want isn&#39;t really a good effect, especially since you have it so you can just drop in and out of a form until you get a 10+ and all the good features you want. Tags and increased damage aren&#39;t bad ideas, but if one of your complaints is that you can just roll over and over maybe a simple &quot;pick x advantages and disadvantages&quot; would suit your purposes better.<br /><br />I think there&#39;s an underlying misunderstanding about what a higher stat actually means, or at least a different understanding than what I have. Higher strength doesn&#39;t mean you&#39;re stronger*; it means that you&#39;re better able to leverage the strength you have. That&#39;s why you get better at Hack and Slash as it goes up: you know more about where to apply force to best effect. That&#39;s why your witch isn&#39;t any better at combat when they turn into a bear: they still don&#39;t have any combat training.<br /><br />On the other hand, they do have the fictional positioning of being a bear, which allows them to actually activate Hack and Slash with bigger enemies when before that just wouldn&#39;t work, deal their damage to multiple smaller opponents as outlined in the book, etc.<br /><br />*Well, it arguably makes you stronger too, because Load. Point remains.</p>

        <p>Hm, maye just add &#39;...and it takes some time until you can shapeshift again&#39;<br /><br />This hasnt been a problem thus far, because our druid wont abuse his powers, even though he is aware of the potential.</p>

        <p>Hmm, I always interpreted the GM moves for the shapeshifted forms to be &quot;moves&quot;, not specifically &quot;no-roll moves&quot;. For instance, give the bear a move that says &quot;When you <b>maul the hell out of someone</b>, roll +STR...&quot; I think it makes sense for a forest druid to be able to spend most of their time as a wolf, if they want to, so long as they can&#39;t abuse the special moves. It makes for some very cool fiction. There might even be player-imposed drawbacks, such as &quot;I risk losing myself to the nature of the beast if I spend too much time in animal form...&quot; and that provides for some fun GM moves, too.<br /><br />It&#39;s also up to the player to say <i>why</i> the druid doesn&#39;t have to eat if the GM is concerned with it, just like the wizard describing the nature of magic. The player will likely have an excellent answer if they&#39;re in the mindset of their character. Some players might even say, &quot;That really doesn&#39;t fit with my concept for the character. Can we work on an alternate move for me?&quot;</p>

        <p>Never considered having the GM come up with full roll-for-it moves. I don&#39;t think I&#39;d actually <i>do</i> that (too much headache to do that on the fly), but I can definitely see the logic behind it. At any rate, there&#39;s certainly room to justify a Defy Danger roll depending on what the move actually is. Good stuff to think about!</p>

Not every GM or player has the same ideas about it.</p>
