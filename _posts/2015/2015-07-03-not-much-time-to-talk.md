Not much time to talk, but I have here the first draft of <i>Cross World</i>, a cross-genre <i>Dungeon World</i> setting. I&#39;d <b>love</b> comments of any flavor.<br /><br />I&#39;m <b>particularly</b> interested in what people think of the balance level of the new &quot;Chromium Knight&quot; class. Too powerful? Too weak? It&#39;s supposed to be about equal to the Fighter or the Paladin, just with a more particular post-apocalyptic science fiction feel. And chrome.

        <p><i>Worlds in Peril</i> is now out, hot off the press.<br /><br />Or hot out of the mailbox sitting in the sun all day. It could be that, too.</p>

        <p>Hmmm, I guess the 4th of July weekend was the wrong time to ask for feedback. :)</p>

        <p>Ok, so after a first look at it: I like the color and I guess page 2 is enough material to play and explore for quite a while - sounds like there&#39;s potential for a lot of fun. I like the &quot;matter of scale&quot; point of view, and the Overwhelm move.<br />I didn&#39;t look at the classes, I&#39;m sorry... and I cannot comment on how mixing the classes will turn out. I totally want to read a play-report though, if you bring this to the table. It sounds like it will be fun! (and actually, considering the setting, I wouldn&#39;t worry too much about the scores/moves balance between the various playbooks).</p>

        <p>Heh. I don&#39;t want things to get TOO out of whack, tho. :)<br /><br />Don&#39;t worry about the Technician class, just the Chromium Knight. Technician is just a modified cut/paste from <i>Adventures on Dungeon Planet</i>, since it&#39;s under Creative Commons (as this will be).<br /><br />Thanks for giving it a peek!</p>
