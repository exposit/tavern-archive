So, my group had to stop in the middle of an adventure and we are getting back together tonight, but one of the guys can&#39;t make it.  How do you  handle missing or rotating players?  Thanks.

        <p>We&#39;re very pragmatic with it and just ignore them. Usually they were knocked unconcious during the last fight. Or were out on a barcrawl. Something like that.</p>

        <p>Took a side quest. Or went to check on the horses outside the dungeon.</p>

        <p>Druid - evil spirits change him in werewolf. He attacks the group then run for the nearest forest.<br />Kidnapped - after camp the pc is missing<br />... etc</p>

        <p>What do you do when their character is needed, like a healer of in the middle of a quest designed for that many people?</p>

Balanced encounters and &quot;fair&quot; fights aren&#39;t really a thing.<br /><br />Regarding the original post: I typically run DW with 3 players (max 4), so having 1 not show is a pretty big deal.  I&#39;m loathe to have to make someone &quot;disappear&quot; in the middle of a dungeon.  I&#39;d generally rather reschedule and/or play a board game.</p>

        <p>If it would break the fiction too hard to have them be somewhere else, I play them like an NPC. But they don&#39;t get XP for not showing up.</p>

        <p>You could do a flash back sequence. Expand on the characters backstory or maybe even delve into why the quest they are on is so important.</p>

        <p>Check out the concept of &quot;love letters&quot;. They&#39;re a summary of what happened to the character while they were out.</p>

        <p>Helios: I wouldn&#39;t give them items but I don&#39;t see a problem with giving them XP. It should be a reward for role playing, after all.<br /><br />And it&#39;s not hard to &quot;de level&quot; a character in DW, just have them start at base if its important to you.﻿<br /><br />Edit: and even items can be added if it&#39;s something like a secret weapon they are waiting to use till the big bad shows up.</p>

        <p>Our wizard is a busy guy, and sometimes can&#39;t make it. In those instances, he&#39;s away doing esoteric wibbly-wobbly &quot;wizard&quot; business. It&#39;s become quite a parody of itself.</p>
