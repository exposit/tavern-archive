<b>UPDATE 10/9/15</b>- <i>Between David&#39;s poll and mine, both the Fighter and Gun-wielder were top and only two votes apart from each other. So we shall be doing the Fighter first then Gun-wielder.</i><br /><br />Our eighth playbook poll!<br /><br />Thank you to those who vote. :)

        <p>Clerics need love. Seems like half the party takes the cleric move as soon as they can multiclass. They need more red meat all their own.</p>

        <p>Fighter or Cleric for sure, they are both in need of some dire reworking.</p>

        <p>I can easily picture a stout dwarf wielding a body shield and a (somewhat) rudimentary repeating pistol</p>

        <p>Look guys, I like the idea of a DW gunslinger too, but come on. The fighter is in desperate need of an overhaul.</p>

        <p>Ok, guys, cheat!<br />Remake the Warrior, then make a poll with the other candidates.<br />Make it the Italian way!</p>

        <p>Not a fan of the gunslinger in any fantasy game.<br /><br />I like my fantasy rpg like my pot roast. The same as when it was on grandma&#39;s kitchen table. </p>

        <p>What other remakes have you done <span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink" href="https://plus.google.com/104623400813415689503" oid="104623400813415689503">Melissa Fisher</a></span> ?<br /><br />Nevermind, found the Bard and Druid :)  In that case, my vote is definitely the Cleric.  I&#39;d like it to be something other than undead-focused, but have the flexibility that it <b>could</b> turn undead, etc.</p>

        <p><i>If</i> we do a cleric we would want to make sure that you can use moves that work with your faith. So if you are a cleric worshiping the God of Death, then Turn Undead might not work so well. However, that has only been in discussion. Things may change.</p>

        <p>Maybe if you worship Baron Samedi you can get the undead to party with you instead of eating faces? Assuming you have rum and cigars.</p>

        <p>Well, at the very least, perhaps this poll (or a future one) can determine future playbook development priority rather than picking just one option. That way the folks who vote for fighter or cleric at least know their playbook is on the docket.</p>

        <p><b>UPDATE</b><br /><br />Since the Fighter and Gun-wielder are really close to each other we will be doing both. <br /><br />On a separate note I have started building upon a new cleric. Hopefully that can go right along side the others.</p>
