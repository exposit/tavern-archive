Gamemasters new to Dungeon World often ask about scripted adventures and how they should prep for running the game. Those of us that enjoy the powered by the apocalypse games have discovered that they play well without the need for pre-designed adventures…

        <p>I&#39;m definitely going to be stealing the think of some cool Areas Before Hand and put them in play when they make sense part of this as I never thought about this before but I think would work great. </p>

        <p>It&#39;s my focus with Dungeon World. When I picture an area where an encounter may take place I&#39;m really thinking about all of the things that could conceivably come into play. Things like an iron grate on the floor (someone&#39;s foot could get stuck), the giant chandelier suspended from the ceiling (could fall on someone), the rotting bannisters (may collapse when stumbled upon), loose floor tiles (footing hazard), rusty weapons on the wall (may become improvised weapons), the list goes on an on.<br /><br />Think of an area in a similar manner to how you might think of a creature; what could this place to do a hero? What could be used by either side? What potentially hazardous things are here? Remember, it doesn&#39;t have to be anything as obvious as a spike-filled pit, a half inch of stagnant water on smooth tile can be just as hazardous. Of course put that standing water near the spiky pit and, well you get the idea. </p>
