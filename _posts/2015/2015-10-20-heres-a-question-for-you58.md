Here&#39;s a question for you:<br />How do <b>you</b> make a  enemy &quot;strong&quot; in a battle? Do you straight up perform more hard moves when everyone is looking at you?

        <p>Yes. Pretty much. Especially the moves that aren&#39;t &quot;deal damage&quot;.</p>

        <p>Yep. Or make the environment equally dangerous. Never underestimate the tension of a threat they can&#39;t punch in the face.</p>

        <p>I give it something that is strong against the pcs in particular</p>

        <p>Since the narration seems to always be playing like a movie in my head, I go with what is obvious most times, and puts the players in a hard spot or requires a difficult choice - escalate, escalate escalate.</p>

        <p>The basic GM moves are gold for this, but I always love using a monster&#39;s specific moves to make them more characterful and iconic. </p>

        <p>I lean heavily on <b>tell them the requirements or consequences and then ask</b>: &quot;It&#39;s got a longer reach than you do, if you charge in it&#39;s just gonna impale you. You still want to do that?&quot;<br /><br />Also, <b>reveal an unwelcome truth</b>.  &quot;It&#39;s pretty clear that cutting at the vines isn&#39;t going to actually stop this thing. You&#39;ll need to find the roots and dig <i>them</i> up, or find some other way to kill this thing.&quot;<br /><br />Both of those involve giving the beasty tags, qualities, moves, and fictional positioning that effectively &quot;block&quot; a straight-up attack. That makes the PCs have to overcome the blocks first, usually meaning they make more moves, and more moves means more opportunities for consequences.<br /><br />Then, I make the consequences of a miss (or just exposing themselves to an enemy&#39;s attack) really hurt, both fictionally and numerically.  <br /><br />Remember: if you make a move that would deal damage, you deal damage. Even if your move wasn&#39;t specifically <b>Deal Damage</b>.</p>

        <p>Great Advice Jeremy!<br />Remember too that fictional damage is just as powerful as HP ablation (especially in combination). Dealing with the fictional &#39;block&#39; of a broken limb or staunching a haemorrhaging wound is just as complicating as dealing x HP of damage.</p>
