        <p>The nearby duke recently converted to the One True Faith and has declared his intent to tear down the ancient temple to the Great Mother and replace it with a gaudy new cathedral. He&#39;s brought in engineers from City and priests from the One True Faith to draw up the plans.<br /><br />The locals, who follow the old ways and are horrified at the prospect of losing their beloved temple, have pooled their money to hire your LAC. They want you to save the temple, but you can&#39;t overtly oppose the duke or the priests. Violence is right out (treason, you know) and the duke has a reputation for hating adventurers (rumor has it he failed the make the cut in his youth).<br /><br />A local, small-time spellwright suggests that you convince the duke and/or the priests that the god of the One True Faith wants the ancient temple to stand as-is.  In other words, to fake a message from on high.  He&#39;s been working on a new illusion spell (intended to add special effects to the community theater) that might be useful. Well, no, he&#39;s still working the kinks out. But it should all work <i>in theory</i>.<br /><br />(Protect without discovery, test experimental magic, local civilian request for aid, temple)</p>

        <p>This table helped me focus the players mission. In my head I just wanted the characters to explore the dungeon. Browsing at the table I found lots of opportunities and define the adventure goals more clearly: <b>you have to do this!</b></p>
