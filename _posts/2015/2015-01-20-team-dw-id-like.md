Team DW -- <br /><br />I&#39;d like to start compiling (sure, admittedly for selfish reasons, but to help the community too!) a list of &quot;idea generators&quot; for key moments in DW play.  <br /><br />My idea is to use this forum (initially) to help lay out ideas and support the improvisation during play by giving GMs lists of things they can do when soft/hard moves are triggered.  <br /><br />For example, when it comes to hard choices in combat, I once had a situation where a creature with the messy tag was up against the fighter.  She truly botched her role, just as the thief was leaping up and over the creature.  So, I turned to her and said &quot;Your choice -- you loose your hand or he looses his foot&quot;.  <br /><br />I know these can be very situational, so I&#39;m not looking for answers for everything -- but me, personally?   I find I can &quot;fall back&quot; on a limited set of answers and I want to expand my own horizons. <br /><br />So, denizens of the tavern -- what are some of your best ideas for hard choices?  What are some great downsides you&#39;ve pulled?  When have you put people in a spot, or turned their moves back on them?  What are ideas and examples you&#39;ve used that others can benefit from?

        <p>It&#39;s a bit more basic than I think you were going for, but I made a stack of index cards, with each DM move written down on four of them. I shuffle them up at the start of session, and when I get presented a move unless I have a cool idea right off the bat, I draw one and make it work. It was wonderful at breaking my habit of always using Deal Damage. Since I don&#39;t replace the cards until I&#39;m out, this forces me to get used to using everything.<br />When I&#39;m looking to offer them a choice, naturally I draw two.</p>

        <p>What do they need?<br />Who do they love?<br />What do they cherish?<br />What do they covet?<br />What do they hold true?<br />Who do they despise?<br /><br />Make them choose between two of these things to the detriment of the other.</p>
