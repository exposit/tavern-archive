Does anyone have any custom social moves? Just curious as to what people have come up with.

        <p>Isn&#39;t &quot;find proper merchant&quot; covered by Supply?<br /><br />As for &quot;overheard at the tavern,&quot; how about this:<br /><b>Eavesdrop</b><br />When you <b>listen to a conversation that doesn&#39;t concern you</b>, roll +CHA (or maybe WIS?). On a hit, you learn some hot gossip or a juicy rumor. On a 10+, this information is of immediate benefit to you. On a miss, someone notices you&#39;re listening in...</p>

        <p>From my &quot;Commoner&quot; class :<br /><br />Rumor Has It<br />When you spend a few hours in a civilized area with<br />your ear to the ground, roll + CHA.<br />On a 10+ the GM will give you a rumor about a thing or<br />person that you have been searching for.<br />On a 7-9 the GM will give you a rumor about<br />something or someone that may be handy.<br />On a miss the GM will tell you how you gain the ire of<br />someone dangerous.<br /><br />and<br /><br />Gossip<br />When you share gossip with the locals, you may trade<br />Bolster, 1 for 1, for a significant secret about someone<br />you know the name of.<br /><br />From &quot;The Heir&quot; :<br /><br />Royal Presence<br />When you wine and dine with someone, ask any one person present<br />a dangerous or significant question. NPCs must answer honestly if<br />they can. Players receive XP if they answer fully and honestly.<br /><br />And a general use custom move :<br /><br />When you (get drunk, are magically compelled to tell the truth, etc) Roll+CHA. <br />On a 10+ you can converse as you like.<br />On a 7-9, you cannot tell a direct lie, but may still mislead, abstain from comment or answer, or change subjects.<br />On a miss you put your foot in it - not only do you tell the truth, but you end up volunteering information you probably shouldn&#39;t have.  The GM will &#39;help&#39; you with this if you cannot think of a decent admission.</p>

I like moves that give you more to do with preparation.<br /><br />Here&#39;s a class move I wrote, not for a medieval setting but could be used for one:<br /><br />Reputation<br />When you return to a settlement or station you&#39;ve been to before after some time away and look up old contacts, roll+CHA. On a 10+, name two friends you have here. On a 7-9, name one friend. Your friends have special skills or access to useful resources and information, and a couple hundred credits or the promise of a favor is usually enough leverage to get them to help you out. Take +1 ongoing to Parley with all of them until you leave this place.<br /><br />And here&#39;s something you might be interested for player interactions:<br /><br />Distant<br />When you take this move, erase a bond from your list and write in a new, special bond: “I’m keeping <i>_</i> at a distance.” When you Aid or Interfere with someone you have this bond with, you may roll with whatever stat fits the situation, as with Defy Danger.</p>

        <p>Wow, thanks everybody. Didn&#39;t have anything really in mind, but  I felt that the social side of dungeon world was a bit lacking. Just found this cool thread after <span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink" href="https://plus.google.com/102471828307590489125" oid="102471828307590489125">james day</a></span> mentioned the AW move.  After reading this thread I&#39;m considering adapting it somewhat, or at least  making some changes to &#39;discern realities&#39;, and &#39;spout lore&#39; options. <br /><br /><a href="https://rpggeek.com/thread/932830/discern-realities-vs-apocalypse-worlds-read-sitch" class="ot-anchor">https://rpggeek.com/thread/932830/discern-realities-vs-apocalypse-worlds-read-sitch</a><br /><br />What are your guys thoughts on social nuances in DW? From where I&#39;m looking at it, it&#39;s all on the GM to give every character life, and DW doesn&#39;t have as many of the tools to do some of the things AW did, because, well, it&#39;s a very different game and the focus is different. <br /><br />I wonder what their thought process was behind mixing read a sitch and read a person into discern realities.<br /><br />And, if I wanted to give player&#39;s more reliable tools to interact with GM characters, what would you do? </p>
