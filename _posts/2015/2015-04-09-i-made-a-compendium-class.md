I made a compendium class about setting traps.<br /><br />The Trapmaster<br /><br />When you repel 3 invading parties with the help of traps you set or repel a single party with nothing but traps you set, you may take these two moves when you level up in place of an advance. <br /><br />Prepare Traps<br />When you spend a few hours preparing traps in an area, you set your hold to 3 and forget where any previous traps are. Don’t tell any players where these traps are yet: they could be anywhere. <br /><br />Reveal Trap<br />When you reveal someone has triggered a trap in the area you most recently prepared with traps, Roll 2d+Int. On a hit, the trap is activated. Describe the trap and pick the effect it has on who triggered it.<br />-Deals d6 damage to them.<br />-Separates them from the action.<br />-Holds them in place for a brief moment.<br />-Seals off an exit for them.<br />On a 7-9, you spend 1 hold from the Prepare Traps move. You can’t trigger this move if you have 0 hold. The GM may ask you at anytime how you set up this trap, tell them now.<br /><br />When you have those two moves, you may pick one of these moves in place of an advance. <br /><br />Treacherous Traps<br />When you reveal a trap that deals damage, you may also give it the Forceful, Messy, or Piercing 2 tag.<br /><br />The Big One<br />When you reveal a trap on a 10+, you may spend 1 hold to pick a second target for it&#39;s effects.<br /><br />Alarm Ears<br />When you hear an alarm go off, you may ask the GM &quot;Have we encountered the creature who triggered the alarm before and if so, who is it?&quot; and they will answer truthfully.<br /><br />Acme Quality<br />When you roll a 7-9 while revealing a trap, you may choose to forgo spending hold. If you do, the trap unintentionally gives an advantage to an opponent or a disadvantage to you or an ally.<br /><br />Notes: I sort of had &quot;Number Appearing&quot; style games in mind when I wrote this, considering you&#39;d be spending a lot of time in the dungeon with frequent intruders. You could probably use it for any campaign that has a central base of operations you find yourself defending frequently.

        <p>Nice. What about to use 1 Adventurer Kit and/or 1 ration when Preparing Traps? It could be useful to avoid a continuous laying down traps everywhere. Ok, I  understand you forget the previous traps location, however is feel this one useful to &quot;prepare traps when really important/meaningful&quot;.</p>

        <p>I like this very much; it&#39;s kind of a battlefield engineering or hunting specialisation. One potential problem is that it&#39;s quite defensive and static, hence the following suggestion. <br /><br />Given the expertise here, something about detecting and disabling traps is also in order, on the understanding that setting traps is the perfect training for overcoming them. <br /><br />I suggest Detect &amp; Disarm Traps: 10+ gives Hold 3 vs finding or disabling traps in that location. A 10+ also might give the option of dismantling and reusing the trap in some way: turning it around, moving it elsewhere, enhancing or reducing its effect. <br /><br />7-9 might give Choose from a list of not-so-fun options. <br /><br />(Based on a booby traps and mines course I took, back in ancient history).</p>

Leaving a bunch of traps lying around is a prime opportunity to Turn Their Move Back On Them. <br /><br /><span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink" href="https://plus.google.com/111063200037086452489" oid="111063200037086452489">Michael Barry</a></span> I feel like trap laying and trap disposal is a bit much for a single compendium class. Disarming and detecting traps is roughly a third of what the Thief class does, I don&#39;t want to step on it&#39;s toes.<br /><br />I understand this CC isn&#39;t very useful outside of a defensive niche, but I think that if you meet the qualifying condition, defending is probably already a big part of the campaign. I think an advantage of compendium classes is they can allow for moves that are more situational or campaign specific.</p>

        <p>Nice. You could add a couple of phrases to better clarify those things, like:<br /><br />&quot;The GM could ask you a question or two about the traps you built. Answer truthfully&quot;<br /><br />&quot;When you forget about the previous traps, they are still there. Watch out, you could accidentally become a victim of them&quot;.<br /><br />etc.<br /><br />However, I like this CC, and I can see his place in a lot of campaigns (also, in a &quot;urban  thief&quot; setting, or a &quot;monster hunter&quot; type too).</p>

        <p>Another possibility: given the urban/wilderness possibilities, could this instead be a later option for thief/ranger -- a sort of specialisation? <br /><br />The Ranger would be a master wilderness trapper (animals, including humans) while the thief would tend more to intricate or hidden traps in urban or dungeon settings. <br /><br />The Thief would of course retain their ability to detect and disarm.</p>
