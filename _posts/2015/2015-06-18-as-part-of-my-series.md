        <p>Things I would change:<br />Damage d6;<br />&quot;One Voice&quot;: ▶ Distract an opponent and provide +1 forward to an ally next to it.<br />&quot;Hit the Right Note&quot;: [...] roll+CHA. On 10+ [...] All options... (Consider using conditions first and descriptions after, it shouldn&#39;t affect the dynamic, just the aesthetic structure)<br />&quot;The Lute&quot; and &quot;Minstrel Charms&quot; can be shortened both mechanically and its description. Focus on what the moves does, not how it works (except by its trigger).</p>

I&#39;ll like generalize them to edged weapon, blunt, etc. <br /><br />What do you mean to shorten the moves mechanically? The mechanics of the Lute provides truth from the audience in the form of song, as if unknowingly. I&#39;m not sure how much simpler you would imagine that being presented. Description I could probably shorten a bit, but I don&#39;t know if it would be significantly enough to really make a difference.<br /><br />How would you word it?</p>

        <p>&quot;The Lute&quot; and &quot;Minstrel Charms&quot; are too restrictive, try with less mechanics and see how diferent players can interpretate your move. Try something like:<br /><br />1. (flavor text if you want). When you sing questions to your audience roll+CHA. On 10+ they sing along and truthfully answer 2 questions. On 7-9 they answer just 1 question.<br /><br />2. (Flavor text if you want). When you attempt to suggest someone under the guise of your words, roll+CHA. On a 10+, he acts accordingly. On a 7-9, they will notice your influence after doing what was asked.<br /><br />In my recent tests, I&#39;ve learned the longer the move, less engaging it sounds like for players, and they tend to no use it.</p>
