Discern Realities:<br />How do I make this move flow from the fiction?<br />What sort of trigger words should I be listening from my players that would make me trigger this move?<br />I have had my players start saying &quot;I discern realities&quot; - naming the move. Ugh!<br />Help please...

        <p>If they are asking a question, searching, examining, etc. It flows from the action. Visualizing the action helps. Paying attention to their motive/goal regardless of what they are actually saying or doing. Also if you want to convey information you can look for a pretext to call for the move. Is a tip off but players are good sports. <br />I don&#39;t encourage players to name or even hint at moves.</p>

        <p>&quot;I examine the thing to see what it does.&quot;</p>

        <p>Last Inverse World game:<br />-I put my ear to the door and listen, uh, and are there some strange smells passing thru? (NO, it was not THAT door!)<br />-I fly about over the place, searching for people moving too quickly<br />- I climb over the giant fungi and try to find a safe way to the ruins<br />-I get into the pit and root around through the spider carcasses, in order to find SOME F@#@#g loot.</p>

        <p>Players can and should name their move by the way. </p>

        <p>Personally, I prefer if the players don´t mention their Move as part of their <b>declaration</b>, but I´m fine with it as a clarification in the discussion that follows. Ie. &quot;I look around, seeing if I can find any hint as to what has happened and if there was a trapdoor or something that Dr. Zorbo might have used to escape this locked, windowless room. <b>looks up from dice</b> That´s... Discern Realities, right?&quot;</p>

        <p>If we&#39;re talking about playbook moves, players can and should name what they&#39;re doing, but it&#39;s news to me that they should name basic moves. I always understood moves being triggered by (and almost only by) narration being a core concept of PbtA.</p>

        <p>I find it more immersive if players aren&#39;t angling for a specific move, punching the buttons on their character sheet... its better and more organic if they just describe what they imagine their characters doing. That doesn&#39;t work for all the special moves on a character sheet, because as a GM I can&#39;t remember them all, so they need to help with those.</p>

        <p>Right on, Mike. It&#39;s a fine line. I feel pretty ok with players kind of angling for a move, especially if it&#39;s something awesome. They just have to work the fiction. It&#39;s trickier with playbook moves, but with experience, no sweat. <br /><br />To bring it back to Discern Realities, they have to be doing something besides generally looking around. I&#39;m always forthcoming and honest about general details, especially if nothing sinister or secret is right there. It&#39;s when they actively search or analyze with the intent to get ahead, and/or get themselves close to imminent risk that the move would help with, that the dice come out. <br /><br />If I can tell they want to make the move but aren&#39;t doing anything to trigger it, I ask what they&#39;re doing specifically to figure stuff out. If they still don&#39;t show effort, I&#39;ll give any more mundane info that may come up, but they don&#39;t get the move. <br /><br />Now, what I have a hard time implementing smoothly is Spout Lore. Thoughts on that interesting but oft-overlooked move?</p>

        <p>I personally am a fan of &quot;I look around for&quot; with Discern Realities. As normal you have little time to use this move in an action sequence and especially there a lot of the questions are useful and would add to the scene. No one does that though as &quot;taking a quick overview of the battlefield&quot; isn&#39;t enough to trigger it while in Apocalypse World it is. I see many more situations read in Apocalypse World then in regular Dungeon World. There are of course other factors but the ammount of time it takes doesn&#39;t help.  </p>
