Hello everyone!<br /><br />My players and I are having a vague attempt at making a podcast (currently playing Dungeon World). It&#39;s nowhere near the quality of some (I&#39;m looking at you One Shot and Campaign) as we&#39;re limited on hardware and I&#39;m still flailing my way through the basics of audio editing.<br /><br />At this stage the first three episodes are available on our website (<a href="http://fumblepodcast.com/" class="ot-anchor">http://fumblepodcast.com/</a>) or iTunes (<a href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/podcast/fumbling-and-mumbling/id1052924897" class="ot-anchor">https://itunes.apple.com/gb/podcast/fumbling-and-mumbling/id1052924897</a>); this includes our character and world development and our first session.<br /><br />If anyone is interested then we&#39;d love some feedback - good or bad (just be aware this lags behind our actual sessions so we might not be able to take feedback into account for a while if that makes sense).

        <p>I&#39;ve listened to the first 3, enjoyed them a lot. On a rules note though, I noticed that when someone roles 10+ for hack and slash you&#39;ve not offered the &#39;extend yourself to do extra damage option&#39;.</p>

        <p>Hi Sean, glad you&#39;re enjoying. I&#39;m never sure if we actually have any listeners :D.<br /><br />Well spotted on the hack and slash, it&#39;s something I&#39;m aware of and have started to make a point of offering in more recent sessions (though they haven&#39;t taken me up on it yet - I&#39;ll need to make it more tempting).<br /><br />Let me know if you spot anything else, we&#39;ve not done any PbtA games before so I&#39;m sure there are other things that we&#39;re doing wrong.</p>

        <p>Generally I&#39;m really enjoying it. Nice to hear some British voices for a change!</p>
