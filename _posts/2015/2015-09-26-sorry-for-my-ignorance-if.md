Sorry for my ignorance if this has already been covered, I&#39;m new to DW. But I love to tinker. <br /><br />I noticed a few posts about set damage and variable damage other than die types.<br />Taking something from 13th Age what about set damage with a bonus on odds or even rolls. For example Fighter damage being a set 5. On an even roll add +3.<br /><br />Another use of the odd/even roll could be traits. For example an elven long bow could have, Even roll gain +1 piercing.<br />
