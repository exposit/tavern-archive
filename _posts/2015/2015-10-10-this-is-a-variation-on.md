This is a variation on Arcane Art, designed for an enchanter. What would be good, simple effects for an enchanter to be able to cast? (No magic missiles, please) I can take a few stronger ones as advanced moves.<br /><br />You possess a magical staff which you have painstakingly enchanted yourself, describe it! When you draw upon your staff’s power, choose an effect:<br />•	Option 1<br />•	Option 2<br />•	Option 3<br />•	Option 4<br />Then roll+INT. *On a hit, your desired effect comes to pass. *On a 7–9, choose one:<br />•	You cannot use that effect again until you repair your staff.<br />•	You draw unwelcome attention or put yourself in a spot. The GM will tell you how.<br />•	You strain yourself, take -1 ongoing to INT until you have a few moments to clear your head.

        <p>1 An extremely bright light temporarily blinds all who have not taken action to avoid looking towards it.<br />2 A booming noise of your choice temporarily drowns out all other sounds, and may frighten and disorientate any not able to understand what is happening.<br />3 A large trench opens in the ground from the base of the staff to <a rel="nofollow" class="ot-hashtag" href="https://plus.google.com/s/%23near/posts">#near</a> distance. <br />4 The staff flies under your control anywhere within <a rel="nofollow" class="ot-hashtag" href="https://plus.google.com/s/%23near/posts">#near</a> distance,can carry the weight of a laden humanoid, and may be used as a weapon.<br /></p>

        <p>The following might be better for a druid&#39;s staff, but...<br /><br />1) The staff absorbs a magical or elemental effect and channels harmlessly (?) into the ground<br /><br />2) Rap the staff against a seam or crack in an object or construct, causing it to split and tear as if pried apart by years of growing roots.<br /><br />3) Plant the staff firmly in the ground. In a matter of minutes, it sets down roots and grows to be a mighty oak tree. It reverts to staff form at your touch and command.<br /><br />4) Gesture upwards with the staff and cause the local vegetation to rise up, ensnare, and restrain up to 1d8 creatures of your choice.</p>

        <p>That is a bit too druid-like. I think instead I&#39;m going to do something simpler. Thanks anyway.</p>

        <p>For a craftsman enchanter:<br />-imbue an object with supernatural resilience<br />-make a simple mechanical object stop working<br />-call into being a small amount of an elemental essence (a quart of water, a candle flame, a handful of sand, a rock, an arc of electricity, etc.)<br />-bring rust and decay upon an object<br />-ask the GM, &quot;who made this object?&quot;<br />-bless an ally&#39;s armor, granting +3 armor forward<br /><br />For a beguiler of the mind:<br />-ask someone, &quot;what do you most desire?&quot;<br />-erase a moment from someone&#39;s memory<br />-weave an illusion of terror, majesty or disguise<br />-project your voice into the mind of someone you can see<br />-summon fear, lust or anger into someone&#39;s heart<br />-overhear the surface thoughts of someone you can see<br /><br /><br /></p>

        <p>These have all been great ideas. Got me thinking of cool ideas myself<br /><br />*Levitate an object of a weight no more than 1lb<br />*Unlock a lock of simple complexity<br />*Cast light on an object within a near range<br />*Bolster a friendly creature, +1 forward<br />*Change the appearance of your clothing for a short time<br />*Your eyes seem better adjusted to the dark. You have vision comparable to that of dark vision for a brief moment.</p>
