I&#39;m basically a nub to the dungeon world game play (and I know no one wants to deal with a nub but...) and I would really love to learn. If anyone needs an extra player for a game there doing I would be honored to join.

        <p>I think you&#39;ll find the DW community pretty welcoming to newbies.  Most people pick up the game quite quickly, so new people aren&#39;t as much of a burden.<br /><br />Plus, because the game&#39;s mechanics are largely narrative, new people sometimes say hilarious shit, too, which is great.  :)</p>

        <p>Because of how DW runs, new players :<br /><br />A - Are pretty well equipped to play anyway if they&#39;ve got imagination, are literate, and have chemistry with the group.<br /><br />B - Bring new ideas and interpretations to the table, which can sometimes make play more enjoyable for everyone.<br /><br />I wouldn&#39;t sweat it.<br />  Did you see Wesley Stafford&#39;s post about DMing and needing players?  It looks like he posted about an hour after you..</p>

I&#39;d love to join your game if your still needing players. I&#39;m not positive on what to do but I think I have somewhat of an idea.</p>
