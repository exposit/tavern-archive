I&#39;m trying to come up with a couple of good moves for a knight that boosts Defend, but I&#39;m not having much luck on thinking of cool things to do. Here&#39;s what I have so far, and I&#39;m still kind of iffy on it. What else can you do with advanced moves for Defend besides giving more hold?<br /><br />I Am Your Shield<br />When you Defend someone you have a Bond with, add +Bond to the roll.<br /><br />I Am Your Sword<br />Replaces: I am Your Shield<br />When you Defend someone you have a Bond with, add +Bond to the roll and take +Bond forward to Hack and Slash against the foe you defended against.

        <p>Those are very mechanical moves, which isn&#39;t necessarily a bad thing. But I would look at things from a fictional angle first. What is this character able to do that others can&#39;t?</p>

        <p>Fictionally, the character is a knight, one who guards the realm. The benefit comes from both training and loyalty, which is why I wanted to put +Bond in there. </p>

        <p>Right, right. But does the player roll + Bond instead of roll + Con to defend? If so, that might be a pretty small bonus.</p>

        <p>No, in addition to +CON.</p>

        <p>In that case, I think you might get some pretty high modifiers. Once you get to +3 and beyond on 2d6, it becomes very hard to fail.</p>

        <p>Yeah, which is why I want something else besides just modifiers.</p>

        <p>Right. Which is why I suggested thinking about what this knight is able to do that others can&#39;t.</p>

        <p>Debt of Honour<br />When you Defend another, take a hold (max 1/person). Hold may be spent to gain leverage over any who care for them.<br /><br />Guardian Angel<br />When you Defend another with your life, hold 1+Bond. Hold may be spent to appear before them as an apparition.</p>

        <p>From my <i>Fourth World</i> hack:<br /><br />Aegis<br />When you defend while wielding a shield, you may also spend hold on the following:<br />• Knock the attacker down or back.<br />• If it is mobile, the thing you defend may move or be moved somewhere safe from the attacker.<br />• Take –1 forward and negate the attack’s effect or damage.</p>

        <p>You might also tinker with the restrictions of the move. The <i>Fourth World</i> also has an archer move that allows them to defend at range, for example.<br /><br />The Defense move allows you to spend hold &quot;so long as you stand in defense&quot;. You might have moves that allow you to &quot;stand in defense&quot; in exceptional ways, or to spend hold even when you no longer stand in defense.<br /><br />Another option would be to expand the idea that your defense allows the defended to do something cool.</p>

        <p>When you defend someone, take extra hold equal to your bonds with them.</p>
