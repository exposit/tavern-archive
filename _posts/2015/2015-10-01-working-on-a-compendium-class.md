Working on a compendium class for a new campaign. Playing with it as a way to invite player input on fronts. Looking for feedback before I introduce it to the table. A few moves are designed specifically for the Bard:<br /><br />Spidermouth Prophet<br />When you learn the forbidden language of the elder Spiders, gain the move &quot;Spidermouth Prpphecy.&quot; You may take any of the subsequent moves as advanced moves when you level up:<br /><br />Spidermouth prophecy<br />When you learn this move, declare three portents of the Spider Queen&#39;s return. Make them as cryptic as you like, but you will know when they come to pass.<br />[  ] Who must die?<br />[  ] What lost relic must be recovered?<br />[  ] What temple, palace or monument must be destroyed?<br />When a portent comes to pass, declare how it fullfills the prophecy and mark it off.<br /><br />When you parley with someone using the Queen&#39;s return as leverage, take +portents to your roll.<br /><br />Calling the swarm<br />When you petition the eight-legged masses with an offering of blood, they will obey your command.<br /><br />Silk blessing<br />When you aid an ally with your arcane art, add “+3 armor forward” to your list of possible effects.<br /><br />Blood scry<br />When you taste the blood of a thinking creature, ask the GM what memory it contains.<br /><br />Edict of poison<br />When you grant an ally bonus damage with your arcane art, you may also enhance their attack with the effect of any known touch poison. <br />You also gain knowledge of the following poisons:<br />Recluse venom (touch): causes painful, disfiguring blisters around the affected area<br />Widow’s bite (touch): causes the targeted area to spasm or go limp<br />Ebonfang’s bile (touch): causes immediate numbness in the targeted area<br /><br /><br />Runic web vigilance<br />When you draw the rune of vigilance on a place, roll+INT. With 10+, hold 2, with 7-9 hold 1. Spend your hold to:<br />-observe the place from afar, as though you were present there<br />-gain +1 forward to discern realities or defy danger within the place<br />The GM may spend your hold to tell you when someone intrudes upon that place.<br /><br />Runic web trap<br />When you draw the runic circle of capture on a place and wish to trap a creature within it, roll+INT. With 10+, you may keep them trapped as long as you maintain your concentration. With a 7-9, choose one:<br />-They won’t stay bound for long<br />-You are also bound in place<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />
