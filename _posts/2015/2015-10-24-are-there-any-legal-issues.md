Are there any legal issues with re-hashing stuff from World of Dungeons into an OGL game? I know WoDu is licensed under the Creative Commons license... but really have no idea what that means. Are there any kind souls of the independent publisher bending that could spare me a couple pennies?

        <p>Short answer: you&#39;re in trouble if you publish something derived from both sources.<br />Longer answer: It means that you have to keep the two &quot;families&quot; separate in your own work. If you publish your mash-up, you&#39;ll have to indicate the Open Gaming Content and the Product Identity for the stuff derived from the OGL content and you&#39;ll have to add the CC license for the stuff derived from the CC content. Since the two are not the same, I think you&#39;d have to entertain the legal fiction of making two separate books or chapters or sections with their own, separate licenses, as there is no license for the combined work: the work derived from both sources.<br />One way out is to derive your work from one source and be &quot;inspired&quot; by the other sources: no copying word for word from any of the other sources.</p>
