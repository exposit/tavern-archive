Anyone else get irritated at yourself later when you think &quot;I should have done THAT&quot; during a session.<br /><br />For instance...<br /><br />The group is climbing a tower of a mad wizard, and comes about a creature that is wearing a key around its neck in a room that has 4 red lanterns (one on each wall).<br /><br />I let them tell me what creature they see. It could have literally been anything.<br /><br />They chose a bunny. (Strangely enough, the creature that I envisioned them picking when I thought up this scenario)<br /><br />One of them trips into the room after a volley roll rolls a 7 (yes, they hit the bunny -- and yes, after a humorous attempt at &#39;animal speak&#39; by my Druid, they knew it wasn&#39;t a real bunny).<br /><br />Walls zoom away in all directions, bunny turns into a massive, slavering, demonic bunny. And they realize quickly enough that they need to kill the lanterns (with the side effect of the room taking a massive, possibly vomit-inducing LURCH after each lantern was destroyed, and making the bunny smaller and weaker in the process).<br /><br />It wasn&#39;t rocket surgery, but it was a lot of fun<br /><br />The part that annoyed me later that night is that I didn&#39;t have the bunny take any massive leaps into the air and land on people. Sure, he fought them, and hurt them pretty good with his sabertooth-like teeth and wicked claws. But I just wish he&#39;d done something more &quot;bunny-like&quot; during the battle (I wish I&#39;d taken 2 minutes after finding out what they wanted to plan out some more thorough monster details)<br /><br />Anyone else have any minor regrets like this?

        <p>&quot;It wasn&#39;t <i>rocket surgery</i>, but it was a lot of fun&quot;<br /><br />My favorite quote of the day.</p>

        <p>Now I WILL play a rocket surgeon in Inverse World.<br /><br />Minor regrets? Yeah, like that time my group found some rocks with strange blue veins, which resembled runic writings, only natural, not manmade.<br />In the end, they didn&#39;t make very much of them, and I thought &quot;What if I had made these alive, and they communicated with each other through these symbols? What if you could make spells or such by following the placement of rocks along a leyline? Alas, too late...<br /><br />The solution: take a piece of paper, and store for future use.<br />Now these stones are back, in another campaign, another world. no magic; mystical pathways which convene instruction for arcane tecnology.</p>

        <p>I was waiting for a Monty Python-esque fight with a killer bunny</p>

        <p>Why yes, I do know that feeling. It&#39;s called &quot;the feeling I get after pretty much every session.&quot;</p>
